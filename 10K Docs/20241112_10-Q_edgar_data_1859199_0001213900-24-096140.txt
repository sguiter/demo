. Initially, our asset-heavy operational model centered on using proprietary artificial
intelligence AI tools for real estate acquisition, converting properties into short-term rentals, and offering fractional
interests to investors. However, due to current macroeconomic challenges like higher interest rates and inflated property prices, we ve
suspended real estate acquisition operations. Our new focus is on enhancing our AI technologies to continuously improve our commission-free,
AI-powered end-to-end homebuying platform, driven by a growth strategy centered on strategic acquisitions.

The determination of the fair value for the acquired

cost of capital WACC ), which represents the necessary return on the combined entity s equity and debt. The WACC is
weighted by the respective proportions of equity and debt in the overall capital structure. 

For the fair valuation of trademarks and
trade names, the relief from royalty method was applied. Customer and other relationships were valued through the
multi-period excess earnings model MPEEM ), which calculates the present value of excess earnings attributed to these
relationships over their estimated remaining useful life. Assembled workforce is not recognized separately from goodwill, as it

entity s equity and debt. The WACC is weighted by the respective proportions of equity and debt in the overall capital structure. 

For the fair valuation of developed
technology, the relief from royalty method was applied. The estimation of the economic useful life of these assets took into account
factors outlined in ASC 350-30-35-3. Trademarks and trade names fair value was determined using the relief from royalty method.
Customer and other relationships were valued through MPEEM, which calculates the present value of excess earnings attributed to
these relationships over their estimated remaining useful life. Assembled workforce is not recognized separately from goodwill, as
it lacks separability and contractual nature. 

Purchase Price Allocation 

The acquisition was accounted for as a business
combination in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price allocation above was allocated to the tangible
and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on management estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill
was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the estimated future economic
benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. 

The final purchase price allocation includes of
acquired identifiable intangible assets, all of which have finite lives. The intangible assets are being amortized
over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. The determination of the useful lives is based upon various industry studies,
historical acquisition experience, economic factors, and future forecasted cash flows of the Company following the acquisition of AiChat. 

Additionally, as part of the acquisition of AiChat, we committed to
purchase ordinary shares of AiChat at a cost of , payable at the transaction s closing. Furthermore, we also agreed
to purchase an additional ordinary shares of AiChat for . The specific dates for these payments are outlined in the Business

30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

 Stock Based Compensation 

 We
issued an aggregate of shares of common stock during and as of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, pursuant to reAlpha Tech
Corp. s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2022 Plan described below. 

 Equity Incentive Plan 

 We maintain the 2022 Plan, under which we may grant
awards to our employees, officers and directors and certain other service providers. The compensation committee of our board of directors
administers the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan permits grants of awards to eligible employees, consultants and other service providers. The
aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2022 Plan may not exceed shares of common stock of which
 remain available for issuance. All of our current employees, consultants and other service providers are eligible to be
granted awards under the 2022 Plan. Eligibility for awards under the 2022 Plan is determined by the board of directors at its discretion. 

The 2022 Plan permits the discretionary award
of incentive stock options ISOs ), non-statutory stock options NQSOs ), stock awards (which may have varying
vesting schedules and be subject to lock-up periods at the board of directors discretion) and other equity awards to selected participants.
Unless sooner terminated, no ISO may be granted under the 2022 Plan on or after the 10th anniversary of the Effective Date (as defined
in the 2022 Plan). 

The compensation committee has the sole discretion
in setting the vesting period and, if applicable, exercise schedule of an award, determining that an award may not vest for a specified
period after it is granted and accelerating the vesting period of an award. The plan administrator determines the exercise or purchase
price of each award, to the extent applicable. The 2022 Plan does not allow for the assignment, transfer or exercise of awards other than
by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 

Unless otherwise provided by the participant s
Option Award Agreement or Stock Award Agreement (as both terms are defined in the 2022 Plan) issued pursuant to the 2022 Plan, upon the
participant s termination for any reason, including but not limited to death, Disability (as defined in the 2022 Plan), voluntary
termination nor involuntary termination with or without Cause (as defined in the 2022 Plan), all unvested equity awards in the form of
options or shares shall be forfeited. Vested options, unless otherwise provided, will remain exercisable for three (3) months following
termination of the participant if such termination is for any reason other than death, Disability or termination for Cause. In case the
participant s separation from service is due to death or Disability, then the vested options will be exercisable for a period of
twelve (12) months thereafter. In case the participant s termination is for Cause, the participant will immediately forfeit any
and all options issued to such participant under the 2022 Plan. 

18 

shares of the Company s
common stock (the GEM Warrants ). The GEM Warrants are exercisable, for cash, at an original exercise price of per
share, which exercise price was subsequently adjusted to after the Company s most recent public offering and the exercise
price of the GEM Warrants is subject to further adjustments specified therein. Due to an ongoing dispute with GYBL regarding the GEM Warrants,
there is uncertainty about the enforceability of the GEM Warrants and their classification under ASC 480 and ASC 815. If the dispute is
not resolved through negotiations and is adversely determined against us, we may be required to reassess the classification of the GEM
Warrants, which could lead to them being recorded as liabilities instead of equity. This reassessment could adversely impact our financial
statements and results of operations. See Note 16 - Subsequent Events for further information. 

On November 24, 2023, we conducted a follow-on
offering by issuing units priced at per unit (the follow-on offering ), each unit consisting
of one share of common stock and one and a half warrants to purchase common stock (the Follow-On Warrants, and together
with the GEM Warrants, the Warrants ). The Follow-On Warrants permit holders to exercise them over a five-year period at
an exercise price of per share, subject to full ratchet anti-dilution provisions included therein. The full
ratchet anti-dilution provisions provide that the Follow-On Warrants exercise price can be adjusted downward to a floor
price of per share as a result of subsequent offerings, and the share amount issuable pursuant to such warrants would increase such
that the aggregate exercise price payable thereunder would equal the aggregate exercise price prior to such adjustment. 

19 

per share, in the case of the GEM Warrants, and less than
 per share, in the case of the Follow-On Warrants, it is unlikely that the holders of the Warrants will exercise their warrants.
While current conditions influencing the exercise of the Warrants make such exercise unlikely, further adjustments to their exercise prices,
or an adjustment to the number of shares issuable upon exercise thereof, as applicable, may make the Warrants more attractive for investors
to exercise. Additionally, as noted above, due to the ongoing dispute with GYBL regarding the GEM Warrants, pursuant to which we are seeking
to void the GEM Warrants, there is uncertainty about the enforceability of the GEM Warrants and method of calculating its exercise price
adjustment, which may impact the exercisability thereof. See Note 16 - Subsequent Events for further information. Consequently,
no adjustments have been made on the exercise price of GEM Warrants based on the one-year anniversary adjustment of such warrants. 

Our analysis is based on the trading price of our common stock as of November
11, 2024, which was per share. 

Rights 

On March 24, 2023, in connection with the acquisition
of Rhove, we allocated rights to each seller and participating investors a right to purchase additional shares of common stock
(the Rollover Stock at a fixed price of per share within a two-year period following the closing date of acquisition
of Rhove and shall thereafter terminate if not exercised within in such two-year period with no modifications to the exercise terms (the
 Rights ). These shares were issued without any restrictions. 

For details on the factors used in the calculation
of the fair value of the Follow-On Warrants and Rights, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-KT.
As the warrants issued in connection with the follow-on offering and GEM Agreement are classified as equity instruments, they are not
subject to fair value remeasurement at the end of each reporting period.

million institutional investment. The Company is seeking the forfeit of all legal fees associated
with this matter, the award of legal fees to bring this matter to action, and further legal and equitable relief as the Court deems just
and proper. In response to the counterclaims filed by the Buchanan Legal Counsel on August 16, 2023, the Company has denied the allegations
made therein, asserting that they lack merit and are either insufficiently supported or entirely untrue. The Company contends that any
damages claimed by the defendants arise from their own negligence and failure to meet their contractual obligations. At this time, the
Company cannot predict the eventual scope, duration, or outcome of the lawsuit.

On November 1, 2024, the Company filed a
lawsuit against GYBL in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Action ). In the
Action, the Company has asserted two causes of action against GYBL: (1) rescission of the GEM Warrants pursuant to Section 29(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), due to GYBL s underlying violation of
Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act for effecting the GEM Warrants as an unregistered securities dealer, and (2) in the alternative, a
declaratory judgment that the exercise price adjustment calculation of the GEM Warrants is governed by the terms provided in the GEM
Warrants, rather than the terms in the GEM Agreement.

Business Overview 

We
are a real estate technology company developing an end-to-end commission-free homebuying platform, which we have named reAlpha, previously
called Claire . Utilizing the power of AI and an acquisition-led growth strategy, our goal is to offer a more affordable,
streamlined experience for those on the journey to homeownership. reAlpha integrates AI-driven tools to offer tailored property recommendations,
an intuitive visual interface, and included digital title and escrow services. The tagline: No fees. Just keys. TM 
reflects our dedication to eliminating traditional barriers and making homebuying more accessible and transparent. 

reAlpha
was announced on April 24, 2024, and it assists homebuyers with tasks such as mortgage pre-approval, booking tours, sending offer letters
and completing property acquisitions. reAlpha also provides market insights, detailed property data, and uses large language models to
answer queries and facilitate the homebuying process via a user-friendly, 24/7 web platform and IOS application. reAlpha s capabilities
are complemented and supported by reAlpha Realty, LLC, our in-house brokerage firm, on a no-obligation and commission free basis. Although
reAlpha is currently only available for homebuyers in 20 counties in Florida, we intend to expand its capabilities nationwide by the end
of 2026 depending on numerous factors, including, among other things, our ability to scale the platform, obtain additional data and successfully
market the platform. 

Due
to current macroeconomic conditions, such as higher interest rates, inflation, and elevated property prices, our real estate acquisition
operations have been halted. Instead, our current focus is being directed towards the continuous enhancement and refinement of reAlpha
and our AI technologies for commercial use to generate technology-derived revenue. Further, as part of our growth strategy, we intend
to continue identifying target companies that are complementary to our business, and we intend to generate revenue from integrating such
acquisitions that we may complete from time to time into our business. To advance such strategy, during the second and third quarters
of 2024 we announced the acquisitions of Naamche, Inc. and its Nepal counterpart entity Naamche, Inc. Pvt. Ltd. (collectively, Naamche ),
AiChat Pte. Ltd AiChat ), Hyperfast Title LLC Hyperfast and Debt Does Deals, LLC (d/b/a Be My Neighbor) Be My Neighbor ). These acquisitions have added revenue, additional potential sources of revenue, technology services, and
additional capabilities to the reAlpha platform. For instance, following the acquisition of Be My Neighbor, we now have an in-house mortgage
brokerage, which mortgage brokerage services are also directly offered through reAlpha. Be My Neighbor is licensed to operate in 27 U.S.
states. Additionally, because of our acquisition of Hyperfast, we now can offer title, closing, and settlement services in 3 U.S. states.
Following the integration of these companies into our business, consumers using reAlpha have access to these services directly in the
platform, both through the web platform and IOS application. 

We expect to continue seeking additional strategic acquisitions that we believe will add additional sources of
potential revenue and services to homebuyers using reAlpha, including, but not limited to, home insurance, AI product companies, and real
estate brokerages. Additionally, we have already acquired a mortgage brokerage and a title company, but we may consider further acquisitions
in these verticals to add additional U.S. state licenses and potential revenue opportunities. 

25 

Before
shifting our focus towards the development of our AI technologies, our operational model was asset-heavy and built on utilizing our
proprietary AI powered technology tools for the acquisition of real estate, converting them into short-term rentals, and enabling
individual investors to acquire fractional interests in these real estate properties, allowing such investors to receive
distributions based on the property s performance as a short-term rental. We may resume the complementary asset-heavy model
from our rental business segment if the prevailing interest rates and other macroeconomic factors align more favorably with such
business model. In the meantime, our growth strategy will encompass both organic and inorganic methods through commercialization of
our AI technologies that are in varying stages of development and acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies. In
particular, we intend to acquire companies that we believe will complement our business model and accelerate our proposition to
expand our technology offerings to customers by offering IT services, staffing and accounting services and others. 

Our
reportable segments consist of (i) technology services (formerly named platform services and (ii) rental business. Our
technology services segment offers and develops AI based products and services to customers in the real estate industry. We are actively
developing four operating technologies that are in varying stages of development: GENA, reAlpha BRAIN, reAlpha App and our main AI-powered
platform, reAlpha. Our rental business segment, to the extent we resume operations, focuses on purchasing properties for syndication,
which process is powered by this segment s technologies and products. 

Technology Services
(formerly Platform Services 

We seek to differentiate ourselves
from competitors primarily through the integration of AI into our technologies for the real estate industry. We expect that our technology
services segment will benefit from the current exponential growth of the AI industry, and we believe that we are well-positioned to take
advantage of these current trends due to our early adoption of AI for the development of our technologies. 

Our
current technology services segment technologies include: (i) reAlpha, (ii) reAlpha BRAIN; (iii) reAlpha HUMINT, (iv) GENA, (v) reAlpha
App and (vi) AiChat s conversational platform. 

myAlphie
was a previously developed technology included in our technology services segment that was sold on May 17, 2023, and it stopped contributing
to our revenues as of such date, except for the revenue generated for the ongoing technical support we are providing to the buyer of myAlphie,
Turnit. 

Our
revenue model revolves around our mortgage services, title services and services offered by our subsidiaries, such as AiChat. As we begin
to acquire more companies in the homebuying transactions vertical, including, but not limited to, insurance and others that are complementary
to our business, we expect to generate revenues by offering such services. We also expect that our reAlpha platform will drive additional
customers to these acquired companies through users interacting and buying homes on reAlpha, which will expand their overall potential
customer base. To the extent we resume operations of our short-term rental operations, we expect to receive fee-based revenues from customers
that would utilize the reAlpha App for participating and investing in our Syndications (as defined below). 

Rental Business 

Our
rental business segment operations are currently on hold due to current macroeconomic conditions, such as escalating interest rates, inflation,
and elevated property prices. We anticipate resuming operations within this segment through the acquisition of properties and Syndications
when the prevailing interest rates and other macroeconomic factors align more favorably with such business model. 

26 

To
the extent we resume these operations, we plan to utilize our AI-powered technologies to analyze and acquire short-term rental properties
that meet our internal investment criteria, or the Investment Criteria, which is analyzed and determined by our technologies,
for syndication purposes, which short-term rental properties are referred to as Target Properties. Once the Target Properties
are acquired, they are prepared for rent and listed on short-term rental sites, and, when warranted, disposed of for profits. We plan
to make investing in our Target Properties available to investors via our subsidiary, Roost Enterprises, Inc. Rhove ). Rhove,
along with Rhove Real Estate 1, LLC, reAlpha Acquisitions Churchill, LLC and future Syndication LLCs (the Rhove SBU ), will
create and manage limited liability companies (each, a Syndication LLC to syndicate one or more of the Target Properties
through exempt offerings. Once the Syndication LLCs are in place, Rhove will launch exempted offerings to sell membership interests in
such properties to investors, through the purchase of membership interests in the Syndication LLCs, pursuant to Regulation A or Regulation
D, each as promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act (each, a Syndication ).
 We refer to such investors as Syndicate Members. To further facilitate the investment process in the Syndication LLCs,
our reAlpha App will work parallel with the Syndication process to allow investors to purchase membership interests in those properties
and become Syndicate Members. We intend to generate revenue through our property Syndications on the reAlpha App to the extent we resume
these operations. 

Syndicate
Members differ significantly to the holders of our common stock. Rights among Syndicate Members may also vary among each other depending
on the specific terms and conditions agreed to in the offering documents pursuant to which the holder becomes a Syndicate Member. By becoming
a Syndicate Member, the holder will not acquire any rights to the Company s common stock and, therefore, will not be entitled to
vote, receive a dividend or exercise any other rights of a stockholder of the Company. Likewise, acquiring shares of our common stock
will not provide the stockholders the status of Syndicate Member. Both Syndicate Members and our stockholders will receive the same quarterly
financial metric information of our listed properties through the reAlpha App and the reAlpha website, which will also be available to
the general public without a login, concurrently with our condensed consolidated quarterly results (as more fully described under Segments
 Platform Services above), to the extent we resume these operations. Syndicate members that have access to the
reAlpha App will only receive personalized financial information respective to their individual holdings in each of our Syndications. To
date, we have not developed a secondary trading market for equity interests in our Syndication LLCs. While the potential establishment
of such a market may be considered in the future, we have not made any decisions to develop a secondary trading market at this time. 

In
addition to managing the property operations, whether internally or through third-parties, we will also manage the financial performance
of the asset, such as evaluating if the after-repair value or appreciated value of the property is higher than the purchase price, or
whether the property is ready to generate the expected profitability. Once our business model is fully implemented, we expect that Syndicate
Members will hold up to 100 ownership of the Syndication LLC, and we would generate revenue through fees from the reAlpha App. 

Recent Developments 

Acquisition of AiChat Pte. Ltd. 

On July 12, 2024, we entered
into a Business Acquisition and Financing Agreement (the Acquisition Agreement with AiChat (as defined above), a company
incorporated in the Republic of Singapore, AiChat10X Pte. Ltd., a Singaporean company (the Seller ), and Kester Poh Kah Yong
(the Founder ). Under the Acquisition Agreement, we acquired 85 of the outstanding ordinary shares of AiChat, an AI-driven
company specializing in conversational customer experience solutions, from the Seller. The remaining 15 of AiChat s shares will
be acquired on June 30, 2025 (the Acquisition ). 

In
exchange for all of the ordinary shares of AiChat outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the Acquisition Agreement, and pursuant
to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Acquisition Agreement, we agreed to pay the Seller an aggregate purchase price of 1,140,000,
consisting of: (i) 312,000 in restricted shares of our common stock, based on a 10 discount to the 10 day volume weighted average price
(the VWAP Share Price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq and issuable to
the Seller no later than January 1, 2025 (the First Tranche Shares (ii) 588,000 in restricted shares of our common stock,
based on a 10 discount to the VWAP Share Price, subject to any Base Case Adjustment (as defined in the Acquisition Agreement), issuable
to the Seller no later than April 1, 2025 (the Second Tranche Shares and (iii) 240,000 in restricted shares of our common
stock, calculated at a 5 discount to the VWAP Share Price, issuable to the Seller no later than December 1, 2025 (the Third Tranche
Shares, and together with the First Tranche Shares and the Second Tranche Shares, the Tranche Shares ). In addition,
we agreed to subscribe for and purchase from AiChat: (i) 55,710 ordinary shares of AiChat as of the Acquisition s closing date,
for a subscription price of 60,000; and (ii) 222,841 ordinary shares of AiChat in accordance with a disbursement scheduled to be determined
and agreed to by us, AiChat and the Founder, for a total subscription price of 240,000. 

27 

The Tranche Shares will be
subject to a 90-day restrictive period (the Restricted Period following issuance, during which the Seller cannot sell,
transfer, or otherwise dispose of the shares or request their registration under the Securities Act. After the Restricted Period, the
shares will be deposited into the Seller s designated account and then transferred to the Founder based on his beneficial ownership
in the Seller. In order to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(a), the total Tranche Shares issued cannot exceed 19.99 of our outstanding
common stock immediately before the Acquisition Agreement, which equated to 8,860,213 shares (the Cap Amount ). Any shares
issued in excess of this amount will be paid in cash to the Seller, as specified in the Acquisition Agreement. 

Additionally, we agreed to
guarantee certain Singaporean bank loans from AiChat totaling approximately 862,092 Singapore Dollars (SGD). The Acquisition Agreement
also includes the assignment of AiChat s intellectual property rights from the Seller to us. Post-acquisition, the Seller will indemnify
us and our affiliates against any liabilities, damages, losses, costs, or expenses arising from third-party claims related to us and the
Acquisition. The Acquisition Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, and conditions for transactions of this
nature. 

Acquisition of Controlling Interest of Hyperfast
Title LLC 

On July 24, 2024, we entered
into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Hyperfast Purchase Agreement with David R. Breschi and Kristen Britton
(the Sellers ). Under this agreement, we acquired 85 of the outstanding membership interests in Hyperfast (as defined above),
a Florida-based company specializing in real estate closings and title insurance (the Hyperfast Acquisition ). The Hyperfast
Purchase Agreement includes standard representations, warranties, and covenants typical for transactions of this nature. 

In conjunction with the Hyperfast
Acquisition, we, the Sellers, and Hyperfast signed an Amended and Restated Operating Agreement (as amended from time to time, the Operating
Agreement ). The Operating Agreement outlines several key provisions, including: annual license fees to be paid to the Sellers,
contingent on their continued service with Hyperfast; annual management fees based on Hyperfast s operating margin; a right of first
refusal for each Hyperfast member to purchase the interests of any member wishing to sell; and various rights for us, as the managing
member, to acquire the Sellers membership interests, and for the Sellers to sell their respective interests in Hyperfast, all in
accordance with the terms specified in the Operating Agreement. 

Streeterville Capital,
LLC Note Purchase Agreement and Secured Promissory Note 

On
August 14, 2024, we entered into a note purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Streeterville Capital, LLC Lender pursuant to which we issued and sold to the Lender a secured promissory note in the original principal amount of 5,455,000 (the Note ).
The Note carries an original issue discount of 435,000 and we agreed to pay 20,000 to the Lender to cover its legal fees, accounting
costs, due diligence, monitoring and other transaction costs, each of which were deducted from the proceeds of the Note received by us
resulting in a purchase price received by us of 5,000,000. Interest under the Note accrues at a rate of 8 per annum, and the unpaid
amount of the Note, and any interest, fees, charges and late fees are due 18 months following the date of issuance. The Note and Purchase
Agreement include certain material terms, including the Lender s ability to redeem a portion of the Note from time to time beginning
seven months after issuance, events of default and penalties associated therewith, restrictive covenants on our ability to issue securities,
subject to exceptions set forth therein, a most favored nation provision, among others. In connection with the Note and
Purchase Agreement, we, Rhove, and subsequently Be My Neighbor, also entered into security agreements and intellectual security agreements
in favor of the Lender, and our U.S. subsidiaries entered into a guaranty in favor of the Lender. 

We
also entered into a placement agency agreement (the Placement Agency Agreement with Maxim Group LLC Maxim ),
pursuant to which Maxim agreed to serve as lead placement agent on a reasonable best efforts basis in connection with the
sale of the Note and any additional notes (the Placement ). Pursuant to the Placement Agency Agreement, we agreed to pay
Maxim a cash fee equal to 3.75 of the gross proceeds received by us for the Note and any additional notes and to reimburse Maxim for
its reasonable accountable expenses, including legal fees, up to an aggregate amount of 10,000. In addition, if within nine months of
a closing of a sale of the Note or any additional notes, we complete any financing of equity or equity-linked capital-raising activity
with, or receive proceeds from, any of the investors that were introduced to us by Maxim in connection with the Placement, then we will
pay Maxim a cash fee of 3.75 of the proceeds received from such financing. 

28 

Acquisition of
Debt Does Deals, LLC (d/b/a Be My Neighbor) 

On September 8, 2024 (the
 Closing Date ), we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the BMN Acquisition Agreement with
Be My Neighbor (as defined above), a Texas limited liability company, along with Christopher Bradley Griffith and Isabel Williams (collectively,
the BMN Sellers and individually, a BMN Seller ). Under this agreement, we acquired 100 of the outstanding
membership interests in Be My Neighbor, a mortgage brokerage firm (the BMN Acquisition ). 

In
exchange for all of the membership interests of Be My Neighbor outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the BMN Acquisition Agreement,
and pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the BMN Acquisition Agreement, we agreed to pay the BMN Sellers an aggregate
purchase price of up to 6,000,000, subject to the adjustments described below to each of the Earn-Out Payments (as defined below) provided
in the BMN Acquisition Agreement, consisting of: (i) 1,500,000 in cash paid on the Closing Date, with each BMN Seller receiving a cash
amount in proportion to each of their membership interest percentage in Be My Neighbor; (ii) 1,500,000 in restricted shares of our common
stock, or 1,146,837 shares of restricted common stock at a price of 1.31 per share, calculated based on the volume weighted average price
of the common stock as reported on Nasdaq for the seven consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the Closing
Date, to be issued within 90 days from the Closing Date and with each BMN Seller receiving an amount of shares of common stock in proportion
to each of their membership interest percentage in Be My Neighbor (the Buyer Shares and (iii) up to an aggregate of 3,000,000
in potential earn-out payments, payable in three tranches of up to 500,000, 1,000,000 and 1,500,000, respectively, in cash or restricted
shares of common stock, at our sole discretion, each of which is calculated based on a formula set forth in the BMN Acquisition Agreement
and subject to the achievement of certain financial metrics by Be My Neighbor for three successive measurement periods of 12 months, with
the first measurement period ending 12 months after the Closing Date (collectively, the Earn-Out Payments, and each, an
 Earn-Out Payment ). Specifically, each Earn-Out Payment will be payable in full if Be My Neighbor achieves certain revenue
and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA thresholds for each of the measurement periods,
each of which is payable within 120 days of the end of a measurement period. If Be My Neighbor does not meet the revenue and EBITDA threshold
in a measurement period, a pro-rated amount of the Earn-Out Payment for such measurement period will be paid to Be My Neighbor based on
the actual revenue and EBITDA achieved and in accordance with the formula set forth in the BMN Acquisition Agreement. Further, if Be My
Neighbor exceeds such revenue and EBITDA thresholds during any measurement period, the Earn-Out Payment for such measurement period will
not be capped and will be increased accordingly based on the formula set forth in the BMN Acquisition Agreement.

Launch of reAlpha
AI Labs and Investment in Xmore AI 

On
August 15, 2024, we announced the launch of reAlpha AI Labs AI Labs ), a research and development initiative to develop,
partner with and potentially invest in artificial intelligence AI startups. We believe that this initiative will provide
a platform for early-stage companies, enabling them to accelerate their development and growth. We expect that the products and technologies
developed from the partnership and collaboration with such early-stage companies will be used to enhance reAlpha, our generative-AI powered,
commission-free home buying platform. Additionally, we plan to partner with universities through AI Labs to further enhance its research
and development capabilities. 

Subsequent
to its launch, on September 30, 2024, we announced that AI Labs invested in Xmore AI Xmore AI ), a company that provides
AI-driven cybersecurity solutions that is developing a software that will consolidate multiple cybersecurity tools into one platform.
The aggregate investment amount was 125,000, consisting of 100,000 in cash and 25,000 in the form of in-kind services, as determined
by the parties. We believe that this investment in Xmore AI will enhance the cybersecurity capabilities of reAlpha, as well as provide
Xmore AI additional funds to continue the development of its cybersecurity software, which will provide AI-driven cybersecurity solutions
to enterprises in multiple industries. 

Recent Legal Challenges
to Sales Agents Commission Structure 

Recent
developments in the real estate industry have seen increased scrutiny and legal challenges related to the structure of real estate agent
commissions. Legal actions and regulatory inquiries have been initiated to examine the fairness, transparency, and potential anticompetitive
practices associated with the traditional commission model. Courts and regulatory bodies may be increasingly focused on ensuring transparency
in commission structures, potentially leading to reforms that impact the earnings and business models of real estate professionals. Changes
in legislation or legal precedents could impact the standard practices of commission-sharing between listing agents and buyer s
agents and may adversely affect our business model and revenues. On October 31, 2023, a federal jury in Missouri found that the National
Associations of Realtors (the NAR and certain companies conspired to artificially inflate brokerage commissions, which
violates federal antitrust law. The judgment was appealed on October 31, 2023, while these and other plaintiffs have filed similar lawsuits
against a number of other large real estate brokerage companies. 

29 

On
or about March 15, 2024, NAR agreed to settle these lawsuits, by agreeing to pay 418 million over approximately four years, and changing
certain of its rules surrounding agent commissions. This settlement resolves claims against NAR and nearly every NAR member; all state,
territorial and local REALTOR associations; all association-owned MLSs; and all brokerages with an NAR member as principal whose
residential transaction volume in 2022 was 2 billion or below and is subject to court approval. Due to this litigation, and effective
as of August 17, 2024, NAR has implemented a new rule that prohibits offers of compensation on MLS listings and requires written agreements
between buyers and buyer s agents. 

Early
indications suggest that these changes are already prompting shifts in industry practices as a result of the NAR lawsuit. For instance,
discussions are underway regarding potential changes to rules established by local or state real estate boards or multiple listing
services. These changes may necessitate adjustments in brokers business models, including alterations in agent and broker compensation
structures, as well as requiring buyers to sign separate agreements to compensate their agents . We believe that we are well-positioned
to take advantage of some of these potential industry changes. Given that reAlpha will serve as a zero-commission real estate buyer s
agent, we believe that buyers that have access to the platform will choose our platform over seeking agents to conduct their property
search and acquisition to avoid paying additional buyer s agents fees through these separate agreements. Additionally, we expect
that our competitors will need to develop mechanisms and plans to enable buyers to negotiate commissions, which may add another layer
of complexity into real estate transactions. We believe that reAlpha will remove such layer by offering all these services including
negotiations of fees through our AI negotiation helper in one platform, while providing buyers with zero-commission fees on all
homes purchased through the platform. 

The
NAR litigation and its ramifications, however, remain uncertain and could cause unforeseen turmoil in our industry, the impacts of which
could have a negative effect on us as an industry participant. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have
been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain accounting policies and estimates
are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations. These policies and estimates require
the application of significant judgment by management. These estimates can be materially affected by changes from period to period as
economic factors and conditions outside of our control change. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In
applying these policies, our management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of
certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results,
the terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available
from other outside sources, as appropriate. We believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected
in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q are appropriate. 

This
Form 10-Q and our Form 10-KT include discussions of our accounting policies, as well as methods and estimates used in the preparation
of our audited consolidated financial statements. For further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, see Item
7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-KT, the notes
to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-KT and Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Since the filing of
our Form 10-KT, we have not experienced a material change to our critical accounting policies or the methods and applications used to
develop our accounting estimates.

Results of Operations 

Pursuant
to the merger (the Downstream Merger between reAlpha Tech Corp. (the Former Parent and reAlpha Asset Management,
Inc. (the Former Subsidiary ), our Former Parent merged with and into the Former Subsidiary, with the Company surviving the
Downstream Merger. Because the Company acquired the Former Parent s assets and liabilities upon consummation of the merger, the
Former Parent s financials became a part of the consolidated financial statements of the Company. As a result, the financial statements
included in this prospectus and discussed herein reflect the operating results of both our Former Parent and the Company prior
to March 21, 2023, which was the date on which the Downstream Merger closed, and our combined results, including those of the Former Parent,
following the Downstream Merger closing date.

Three Months Ended
September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue .
Revenue was 339,227 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 280,205, or 475 , from the comparable 2023 period,
which was primarily driven by the growth and integration of recent acquisitions in our technology services segment. This technology service
segment growth was mainly due to the performance of our AI conversational platform and mortgage brokerage services, which were recently
acquired and integrated into our operations, and which generated 92,595 and 183,128, respectively, during the three months ended September
30, 2024. We have no revenue in our rental business segment. The decrease in revenue compared to the same period in 2023 was due to the
sale of properties previously held for the segment s operations, as a result of putting those operations on hold. 

Cost
of revenue . Cost of revenue was 113,361 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 83,001, or 273 , from the
comparable 2023 period. The increase was primarily due to the integration of the newly acquired businesses within the technology segment.
A significant portion of this increase is attributed to the costs associated with the delivery of our loan brokerage services and AI conversational
platform solutions that accounted for 60,145 and 34,967, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Operating
Expenses . Operating expenses were 1,915,486 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1,157,985, or 153 ,
from the comparable 2023 period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the integration of the newly acquired businesses
within the technology segment. A significant portion of this increase is attributed to salaries of the new employees added as a result
of our recent acquisitions of 507,501, marketing, advertising expenses related to our advertising campaign for the reAlpha platform of
 212,386, and professional and legal services expenses of 210,670 incurred in connection with our recent acquisitions. 

31 

Other
(Expenses) Income . Other expenses were 408,954 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 360,186, or 739 ,
from the comparable 2023 period. This increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of the commitment fee of 125,000 incurred
in connection with the equity facility we have in place with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (collectively, GEM ),
pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement between us and GEM, dated December 1, 2022 (the GEM Agreement ), interest expense
of 83,861, and original issue discount of 36,250 which was related to the Note (see Recent Developments Streeterville
Capital, LLC Note Purchase Agreement and Secured Promissory Note above for further information). 

Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue .
Revenue was 422,006 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 196,706, or 87 , from the comparable 2023 period. This
growth was driven by the expansion and integration of recent acquisitions within our technology services segment, offset by a decline
in revenues from the myAlphie platform following its sale and from the rental business following the sale of properties. The technology
services segment s growth was mainly driven by the contributions of our AI conversational platform and mortgage brokerage services,
which generated 92,595 and 183,128, respectively. There was no revenue recorded in our rental business segment during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, which was due to the sale of properties previously held for the segment s operations as a result of putting
those operations on hold. 

Cost
of revenue . Cost of revenue was 139,687 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 9,831, or 7 , from the comparable
2023 period. A significant portion of the cost of revenue consists of the costs associated with the integration of newly acquired businesses
within the technology segment, including expenses for the loan brokerage services and AI conversational platform solutions, which amounted
to 60,145 and 34,967, respectively. This increase was partially offset by significant reductions in expenses related to the sale of
the myAlphie platform and properties, which lowered related costs. 

Operating
expenses . Operating expenses were 4,406,394 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2,049,359, or 87 , from
the comparable 2023 period. This increase was due to the integration of newly acquired businesses within the technology segment. A significant
portion of this increase is attributed to salary expenses, including 920,144 for new employees and additional expenses from the salary
adjustments for executive officers, marketing and advertising expenses of 273,458 for the reAlpha platform campaign, and 340,889 in
professional and legal services associated with these acquisitions. 

Other
(Expense) Income . Other expenses were 871,856 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6,165,045, or 707 , from
the comparable 2023 period. This decrease was largely due to a one-time gain of 5,502,774 from the sale of the myAlphie platform during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, increases in amortization of the commitment fee of 375,000 incurred in connection
with the equity facility we have in place with GEM, interest expenses of 95,473 and an original issue discount of 36,250 related to
the Note contributed to our other expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in mortgage interest following the sale
of our previously held properties.

Three Months Ended
September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Technology Services 

Revenue . Revenue was
 339,227 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 291,753, or 615 , from the comparable 2023 period. This increase
was primarily driven by revenue generated through the AiChat s conversational platform solutions, the reAlpha platform and our real
estate offerings, including mortgage brokerage and title services, as a result of the integration of our recently acquired businesses.
The integration of these services into reAlpha has provided additional sources of potential revenue to this segment. 

Cost of revenue . Cost of
revenue was 113,361 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 83,001, or 273 , from the comparable 2023 period.
Cost of revenue primarily consists of the direct expenses associated with the delivery of our loan brokerage services and technology solutions.
This includes compensation-related expenses for roles directly supporting loan origination and customer interactions, along with other
direct costs necessary for fulfilling service transactions. 

Operating Loss . Operating
loss was 546,488 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 515,437, or 1,660 , from the comparable 2023 period.
This increase was primarily due to higher salaries for employees from acquired companies and an increase in marketing and advertising
expenses associated with the marketing campaign for reAlpha platform. 

Rental Business 

Revenue .
Revenue was 0 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11,548 for the comparable 2023 period. Because we sold our
properties as a result of putting our short-term rental operations on hold, we do not expect to generate revenue within this segment until,
and if, we resume operations in this segment. 

Operating
Loss . Operating loss was 64,430 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 27,447 for the comparable 2023 period.
This increase in operating loss is primarily due to amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible within this segment. Although
we are no longer generating revenue in this segment as a result of putting these operations on hold, we are still incurring costs related
to the amortization and related expenses resulting from the sale of our previously held properties. 

Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Technology Services 

Revenue . Revenue was
 422,006 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 279,468, or 196 , from the comparable 2023 period. This increase
was driven by revenue from AiChat s conversational platform solutions, reAlpha platform and real estate offerings, including mortgage
brokerage and title services, following the integration of our recently acquired businesses. This increase in revenue was slightly offset
by a decrease in revenue from the myAlphie platform following its sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

33 

Cost of revenue . Cost of
revenue was 139,687 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2,214 or 2 , from the comparable 2023 period. Cost
of revenue primarily consists of the direct expenses associated with the delivery of our loan brokerage services and technology solutions,
including compensation-related expenses for roles supporting loan origination and customer interactions, and other direct costs necessary
for fulfilling service transactions. This increase was partially offset by significant reductions in expenses related to the sale of the
myAlphie platform, which lowered costs related to such platform. 

Operating Loss . Operating
loss was 661,046, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 620,442, or 1,528 , from the comparable 2023 period.
This increase was primarily due to higher salaries for employees from acquired companies, an increase in marketing and advertising expenses
associated with the marketing campaign for reAlpha platform and professional fees related to our recent acquisitions, which reflect the
necessary investments to support and integrate these new operations. 

Rental Business 

Revenue .
Revenue was 0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 82,762 for the comparable 2023 period. Because we sold our
properties as a result of putting our short-term rental operations on hold, we do not expect to generate revenue within this segment until,
and if, we resume operations in this segment. 

Operating
Loss . Operating loss was 193,324 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 226,079 for the comparable 2023 period.
Although we are no longer generating revenue in this segment as a result of putting these operations on hold, we are still incurring costs
related to the amortization and related expenses resulting from the sale of our previously held properties. Additionally, expenses related
to property management and maintenance, which were present in the previous reporting period, also contributed to the overall decline. 

Non-GAAP Financial
Measures 

To supplement
our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP GAAP ), we believe Adjusted EBITDA and Net
income per share, both non-GAAP financial measures, as such term is defined under the rules of the SEC, are useful
in evaluating our operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Net income per share to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal
planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency
and comparability with past financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational
purposes only, have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information
presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP
measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP
financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly
comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and
the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on
any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

Liquidity describes the ability
of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs,
debt services, acquisitions, contractual obligations and other commitments. Our liquidity and capital resources are critical to our ability
to execute our business plan and achieve our strategic objectives. Accordingly, to the extent that collections from our short-term rentals,
if any, and technologies cannot fund our operations, we intend to utilize equity or debt offerings to raise these funds, although volatility
in the capital markets may negatively affect our ability to do so. The cost of capital and historically high-interest rates can also have
a direct impact on our ability to raise capital through debt or equity offerings or to pursue acquisitions. Economic environments yielding
higher interest rates with more stringent debt terms such as today s market environment require larger equity commitments. This
means that, as larger equity commitments are required, we will have less leverage and may have fewer acquisitions overall. We cannot provide
any assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms, if at all. Our ability to raise additional capital will
depend on various factors, including market conditions, investor demand, and our financial performance. 

We had cash and cash equivalents
of approximately 7.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and approximately 6.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Based on our estimates,
we believe we do not have sufficient working capital to meet our financial needs for the 12-month period following September 30, 2024.
While we anticipate continued operating losses in the near future, we are confident in our strategy to continue investing in the commercialization
of our products and technologies and our ability to continue operations. Additionally, we are contemplating to raise capital through an
offering of our securities, and we expect that, to the extent such offering is consummated, we will not need additional capital for a
period beyond the 12-month period following the offering consummation. 

We may also receive proceeds from the cash exercises of the warrants
issued in connection with the GEM Agreement (the GEM Warrants and the warrants issued in connection with our public offering
from November 2023 (the Follow-On Warrants, and together with the GEM Warrants, the Warrants ). We believe
the likelihood that any Warrant holders will exercise their warrants, and therefore the amount of cash proceeds that we would receive,
is dependent upon the trading price of our common stock. We believe that if the trading price for our common stock is less than 371.90
per share, in the case of the GEM Warrants, or 5.00 per share in the case of the Follow-On Warrants, it is unlikely that the holders
of the Warrants will exercise them. While current conditions influencing the exercise of the Warrants make such exercise unlikely, further
adjustments to their exercise price may make the Warrants more attractive for investors to exercise. Due to an ongoing dispute with GYBL
regarding the GEM Warrants, pursuant to which we have claimed that the GEM Warrants are void and subject to rescission under Section 29(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), there is uncertainty about the enforceability of
the GEM Warrants and its terms (see Note 16 Subsequent Events for further information). If the dispute is not resolved
through negotiations and the lawsuit is adversely determined against us, we may be required to adjust the GEM Warrants exercise
price downward significantly, and we may incur penalties under the GEM Agreement and/or other litigation expenses related to the dispute,
which could materially adversely impact our financial statements, cash flows and results of operations. See Note 16 Subsequent
Events for further information. Further, the Follow-On Warrants contain full ratchet anti-dilution provisions that
provide for a downward adjustment to its exercise price, subject to a floor price of 1.44 per share, as a result of subsequent offerings,
and the share amount issuable pursuant to such warrants would increase such that the aggregate exercise price payable thereunder would
equal the aggregate exercise price prior to such adjustment. Our analysis is based on the reported closing price of our common stock as
November 11, 2024, which was 1.00 per share. 

Our business model requires
significant capital expenditures to build and maintain the infrastructure and technology required to support our operations. In addition,
we may incur additional costs associated with research and development of new products and services, expansion into new markets or geographies,
and general corporate overhead. As a result, we may require additional financing in the future to fund these initiatives, which may include
additional equity or debt financing or strategic partnerships. We currently do not have any commitments or arrangements for additional
financing, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If
we are unable to obtain additional financing when required, we may be forced to reduce the scope of our operations, delay the launch of
new products or services, or take other actions that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We may also be required to seek additional financing on terms that are unfavorable to us, which could result in the dilution of our stockholders 
ownership interests or the imposition of burdensome terms and restrictions. 

Contractual Commitments and Obligations 

On August 14, 2024, we entered
into the Purchase Agreement with the Lender (each as defined above) to issue and sell a secured promissory note worth 5,455,000 (see
 Recent Developments Streeterville Capital, LLC Note Purchase Agreement and Secured Promissory Note for further information).
As of September 30, 2024, we have incurred 435,000 original issue discount expenses related to the Note. Further, in accordance with
the Note and related Purchase Agreement, beginning seven months after issuance, the Lender may redeem up to 545,000 of the Note per month,
which amount will be due and payable in cash within three trading days of our receipt of a redemption notice from the Lender. 

The redemption feature of
the Note may require us to make redemption payments at the request of the Lender, which redemptions may have a material adverse effect
on our cash flows, results of operations and ability to pay our debts as they come due, and we may not have the required funds to pay
such redemptions, which could result in an event of default under the Note. The Note and related Purchase Agreement also contain restrictive
covenants on our ability to issue securities, which may further impact our ability to raise capital to meet our redemption payments or
other obligations and expenses as they are due.

Cash Flows 

The following table summarizes
our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods presented.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 3,806,090, compared to 2,825,315 for the same period in 2023. The
increase is primarily due to higher operating expenses, including salaries of 974,004 and professional and legal fees of 340,889, most
of which were acquisition-related costs. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 368,269, whereas for the same period in 2023, net cash provided by
investing activities was 400,330. This change in cash flows from investing activities is mainly attributable to increased capitalization
of software development costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 4,794,866, compared to 105,083 for the same period in 2023. This increase
was primarily in connection with the issuance of the Note (as defined above). In contrast, during the nine months period ended September
30, 2023, proceeds from common stock issuances in connection with our Regulation A offering contributed to financing activities, which
issuances were not present in 2024. 

Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 

We do not have any off-balance sheet transactions.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to provide this information. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange
Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal accounting and financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We carried out an evaluation
under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and
our Interim Chief Financial Officer (principal accounting and financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon the evaluation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and
our Interim Chief Financial Officer (principal accounting and financial officer) concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures 

Our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Interim Chief Financial Officer (principal accounting and financial
officer), does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or
detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

None. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

There have been no material
changes to our risk factors since those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Form 10-KT, except as identified below. 

Our lawsuit against GYBL
may be costly, time consuming and, if adversely determined against us, could result in a significant downward adjustment of the GEM Warrants 
exercise price, and potentially other penalties and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and
business operations. 

On November 1, 2024, we filed
a lawsuit against GYBL (as defined above) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which we are
claiming that GYBL operated as an unregistered broker dealer under the Exchange Act, and pursuant to which we are seeking to void the
GEM Warrants, or, in the alternative, a declaratory judgment determining that the GEM Warrants terms govern the exercise price
adjustment calculation thereof, rather than the related GEM Agreement s terms. An adverse ruling against us in this lawsuit could
lead to a significant downward adjustment to the current exercise price of the GEM Warrants, additional expenses incurred related to
the lawsuit during the ongoing dispute, including, but not limited to, attorney s fees, and any other remedies the court may deem
just. 

Further, this lawsuit may
be expensive, may divert management s time away from our operations, and may affect the availability and premiums of our liability
insurance coverage, regardless of whether our claims are meritorious, or ultimately lead to a judgment against us. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to be successful in this lawsuit against GYBL or resolve any current or future litigation matters, in which case
those litigation matters, including the lawsuit against GYBL, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
operating results and cash flows. 

The obligations to the
Lender under the Note and related agreements are secured by a security interest in all of our non-foreign assets and all of the assets
of Rhove, our wholly-owned subsidiary, so if we default on those obligations, the Lender could proceed against any or all such assets. 

Our obligations under the
Note and the related agreements are secured by all of our non-foreign assets and all of the assets of Rhove, our wholly-owned subsidiary,
pursuant to security agreements and intellectual security agreements executed by us and Rhove in connection with the issuance of the Note.
As such, the Lender may enforce its security interests over our non-foreign assets and the assets of Rhove that secure the repayment of
such obligations, take control of such assets and operations, force us to seek bankruptcy protection or force us to curtail or abandon
our current business plans and operations. If that were to happen, any investment in our securities could become worthless. 

We are subject to certain
contractual limitations that could materially adversely affect our ability to consummate future financings. 

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement,
in connection with the issuance of the Note to the Lender, we agreed to be subject to certain restrictions on our ability to issue securities
until all of our obligations under the Note, Purchase Agreement and all other related agreements are paid and performed in full. Specifically,
we agreed, among other things, to (i) not make any Restricted Issuances (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) without the Lender s
prior written consent, which consent may be granted or withheld in the Lender s sole and absolute discretion, unless the proceeds
therefrom are used to repay the Note in full; (ii) not grant any lien, security interest or encumbrance, subject to certain exceptions,
on any of our or our subsidiaries assets, in each case without the Lender s prior written consent, which consent may be granted
or withheld in the Lender s sole discretion; and (iii) not enter into any agreement or otherwise agree to any covenant, condition,
or obligation that locks up, restricts in any way or otherwise prohibits us, other than such lock ups, restrictions or prohibitions with
a term of no more than 75 days in connection with one transaction, or series of transactions, per any 12 month period: (a) from entering
into a variable rate transaction with the Lender or any of the Lender s affiliates, or (b) from issuing securities to the Lender
or any of the Lender s affiliates. Such restrictions could materially adversely affect our ability to consummate future financings.
Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, if we breach or allegedly breach such restrictions, we will be obligated to indemnify the Lender
and all its officers, directors, employees, attorneys, and agents for loss or damage arising as a result of or related to such breach
or alleged breach, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

While the Purchase Agreement
further provides that at any time during the 12-month period beginning on the date of the issuance and sale of the Note, the Lender will
have the right, but not the obligation, with our prior written consent, to reinvest up to an additional 5,000,000 in the aggregate in
the Company in one or more notes on the same terms and conditions as the Note, there can be no assurance that the Lender will exercise
such right or that we will be able to negotiate such reinvestment from the Lender on terms acceptable to us. 

The Purchase Agreement also
contains a most favored nation provision pursuant to which, so long as the Note is outstanding, upon any issuance by us
of any debt security with any economic term or condition more favorable to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of the
holder of such security that was not similarly provided to the Lender in the transaction documents related to the Note, we agreed to notify
the Lender of such additional or more favorable economic term and such term, at the Lender s option, shall become a part of the
transaction documents related to the Note for the benefit of the Lender. Such most favored nation provision may also restrict
our ability to secure future financings unless the Lender waives its rights under such provision. 

39 

If we are unable to obtain
adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives
and to respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

If we fail to comply
with the restrictions and covenants in the Purchase Agreement or the Note, there could be an event of default under the Note, which could
result in an acceleration of payments due under the Note, the application of default interest and other consequences. 

Failure to meet the restrictions,
obligations and limitations under the Purchase Agreement and the Note may result in an event of default in accordance with the terms of
the Note. Such events include, among others, our failure to pay any amount when due and payable thereunder, us becoming insolvent or declaring
bankruptcy, the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) except those that result in the Note being
paid in full, failure to observe and comply with certain covenants, obligations, conditions or agreements set forth therein, any representation,
warranty or other statement made therein or otherwise in connection with the issuance of this Note being false, incorrect, incomplete
or misleading in any material respect subject to certain cure periods, and effectuating a reverse stock split without a certain prior
written notice to the Lender, which events could result in the acceleration of obligations under the Note. Also, an event of default would,
among other things, provide the noteholder with the right to increase the outstanding balance by 10 for certain major events of default
and 5 for others, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Note. Additionally, at any time following an event of default, upon
written notice to us, interest will accrue on the outstanding balance of the Note beginning on the date the applicable event of default
occurred at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 15 per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. Such consequences
upon an event of default could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if the Lender accelerates the Note,
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under the Note. 

The redemption feature
of the Note may require us to make redemption payments at the request of the Lender, which redemptions may have a material adverse effect
on our cash flows, results of operations and ability to pay our debts as they come due, and we may not have the required funds to pay
such redemptions, which could result in an event of default under the Note. 

From time to time, beginning
seven months after issuance, the Lender may redeem up to 545,000 of the Note per month, which amount will be due and payable in cash
within three trading days of our receipt of a redemption notice from the Lender. Further, once we have made five redemption payments in
cash, all subsequent redemption payments paid in cash will be subject to a 9 redemption premium. Such redemptions may have a material
adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and ability to pay our other debts as they come due. In addition, we may not have
the required funds to pay such redemptions and our failure to pay the redemptions, when due, may result in an event of default under the
Note. 

Failing to successfully
execute and integrate acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

We have acquired Rhove, Naamche,
AiChat, Hyperfast and Be My Neighbor, and may acquire more businesses and/or technologies, as we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions.
We may also not successfully evaluate or utilize acquired technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition,
including accounting charges. In addition, we may finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which could result
in further dilution to our existing stockholders. We may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated.
Those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs. And, in the future, we may not be
able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Any of the
foregoing factors, including if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, can materially adversely affect our business,
results of operations and financial condition. 

In addition, we may not be
successful in integrating acquisitions or the businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Any future failure to manage
and successfully integrate acquired businesses could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: 

difficulties in integrating and managing the combined operations, technology platforms and realizing the anticipated economic, operational, and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays, and failure to execute on the intended strategy and synergies; 

failure of the acquired businesses to achieve anticipated revenue, earnings, or cash flow; 

diversion of management s attention or other resources from our existing business; 

our inability to maintain the key customers, business relationships, suppliers, and brand potential of acquired businesses; 

uncertainty of entry into businesses or geographies in which we have limited or no prior experience or in which competitors have stronger positions; 

unanticipated costs associated with pursuing acquisitions or greater than expected costs in integrating the acquired businesses; 

40 

responsibility for the liabilities of acquired businesses, including those that were not disclosed to us or exceed our estimates, such as liabilities arising out of the failure to maintain effective data protection and privacy controls, and liabilities arising out of the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws; 

difficulties in or costs associated with assigning or transferring to us or our subsidiaries the acquired companies intellectual property or its licenses to third-party intellectual property; 

inability to maintain our culture and values, ethical standards, controls, procedures, and policies; 

challenges in integrating the workforce of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; 

challenges in integrating and auditing the financial statements of acquired companies that have not historically prepared financial statements in accordance with GAAP; and 

potential accounting charges to the extent goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with an acquisition, such as trademarks, customer relationships, or intellectual property, are later determined to be impaired and written down in value. 

We may also expend significant
cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, which indebtedness could result in restrictions on our business and significant
use of available cash to make payments of interest and principal. We may also incur significant transaction and acquisition-related costs
in connection with company acquisitions and such expenditures may create significant liquidity and cash flow risks for us. For instance,
we may incur significant, nonrecurring, and recurring costs associated with potential related company acquisition(s), including costs
associated with the continued integration of the businesses, unanticipated liabilities that we assume as a result of acquiring
companies and other expenses. 

While we have assumed that
this level of expense will be incurred, there are factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount, including other integration
expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. To the extent any
acquisition and integration expenses are higher than anticipated and we do not have sufficient cash, or if we default on any assumed liabilities
as a result of an acquisition, then we may experience liquidity or cash flow issues that may materially adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. 

The use of new and evolving
technologies, such as artificial intelligence, in our operations may require us to expend material resources for compliance and may present
risks and challenges that can impact our business including by posing security and other risks to our confidential information, proprietary
information and personal information, any of which may result in reputational harm and liability, or otherwise adversely affect our business. 

Integrating AI into our operations
presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. There are significant risks involved in utilizing
AI and no assurance can be provided that the usage of AI will enhance our business or assist our business in becoming more efficient or
profitable. The use of certain AI technology can give rise to intellectual property risks, including compromises to proprietary intellectual
property and intellectual property infringement and misappropriation. Other known risks of AI currently include inaccuracy, bias, toxicity,
data privacy and cybersecurity issues, and data provenance disputes. In addition, AI may have errors or inadequacies that are not easily
detectable. AI may also be subject to data herding and interconnectedness (i.e., multiple market participants utilizing the same data),
which may adversely impact our business. If the data used to train AI or the content, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications
assist in producing are or are alleged to be deficient, inaccurate, incomplete, overbroad or biased, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, we expect to see increasing government and supranational regulation
and ethical concerns related to AI use which may also significantly increase the burden and cost of research, development and compliance
in this area. For example, the EU s Artificial Intelligence Act the world s first comprehensive AI law entered
into force on August 1, 2024 and, with some exceptions, will become fully applicable 24 months thereafter. This legislation imposes significant
obligations on providers and deployers of high risk AI systems, and encourages providers and deployers of AI systems to account for certain
ethical principles in their design, development and use of these systems. The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of significant
resources to design, develop, test and maintain our technology and products to help ensure that AI is implemented in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations and in a socially responsible manner and to minimize any real or perceived unintended harmful impacts. The legal
landscape and subsequent legal protection for the use of AI remains uncertain, and development of the law in this area could impact our
ability to enforce our proprietary rights or protect against infringing uses. If we do not have sufficient rights to use the data on which
AI relies or to the outputs produced by AI applications, we may incur liability through the violation of certain laws, third-party privacy
or other rights or contracts to which we are a party. Our use of AI applications may also, in the future, result in cybersecurity incidents
that implicate the personal data of customers or patients. Any such cybersecurity incidents related to our use of AI applications could
adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. 

41 

Third-party vendors and our
subsidiaries may also incorporate AI tools into their own offerings, and the providers of these AI tools may not meet existing or rapidly
evolving regulatory or industry standards, including with respect to intellectual property, privacy and data security. Further, bad actors
around the world use increasingly sophisticated methods, including the use of AI, to engage in illegal activities involving the theft
and misuse of personal information, confidential information and intellectual property. Any of these effects could damage our reputation,
result in the loss of valuable property and information, cause us to breach applicable laws and regulations, and adversely impact our
business. 

Aspects of our business
are subject to privacy, data use and data security regulations, which may impact the way we use data to target customers, and the increasing
regulatory focus on cybersecurity and privacy issues and expanding laws could affect our business model and expose us to increased liability. 

Privacy
and security laws and regulations may limit the use and disclosure of certain information and require us to adopt certain cybersecurity
and data handling practices that may affect our ability to effectively market our manufacturing capabilities to current, past or prospective
customers. In many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data security breach, and such notification requirements
continue to increase in scope and cost. The changing privacy laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, including the General Data Protection
Regulation GDPR in the European Union EU ), which became effective May 25, 2018, and the California Consumer
Privacy Act of 2018 CCPA ). The GDPR and other European laws regarding privacy and data protection regulate the transfer
of personal data from Europe, including the European Economic Area EEA the UK, and Switzerland, to third countries that
have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, unless the parties to the transfer
have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal information. The safeguard on which we have primarily relied
for such transfers has been use of the European Commission s standard contractual clauses SCCs ). We have undertaken
certain efforts to conform transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area EEA to the United States based on
our understanding of current regulatory obligations and the guidance of data protection authorities. In the Schrems II decision
issued by the Court of Justice of the EU CJEU on July 16, 2020, the CJEU invalidated one mechanism for cross-border personal
data transfer, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, and imposed additional obligations on companies relying on the SCCs to transfer personal data.
Similarly, the CCPA was enacted on June 28, 2018 and became effective on January 1, 2020, and it creates new individual privacy rights
and impose increased obligations, including disclosure obligations, on companies handling personal data. In addition, the CCPA broadly
defines personal information, gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, and provides for civil penalties for
certain violations. Furthermore, in November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 CPRA ), which amends and expands CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements and establishes a regulatory
agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements. Additional countries and states, including Nevada, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut,
have also passed comprehensive privacy laws with additional obligations and requirements on businesses. These laws and regulations are
increasing in severity, complexity and number, change frequently, and increasingly conflict among the various jurisdictions in which we
operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. In addition, we are also subject to the possibility of security
breaches and other incidents, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws. 

Additionally, we recently
acquired companies that provide mortgage brokerage services, title services and others. Our mortgage brokerage subsidiary is subject to
the privacy regulations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the GLBA ), along with its implementing regulations,
which restricts certain collection, transfer, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, requires notice to individuals
of privacy practices, provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally
protected information and imposes requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance
of data security standards or guidelines. In addition, on March 1, 2017, new cybersecurity rules took effect for financial institutions,
insurers and certain other companies, like our mortgage subsidiaries, supervised by the NY Department of Financial Services (the NY
DFS Cybersecurity Regulation ). The NY DFS Cybersecurity Regulation imposes significant regulatory burdens intended to protect the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems. We also have contractual obligations to protect confidential
and personally identifiable information we obtain from third parties. These obligations generally require them, in accordance
with applicable laws, to protect such information to the same extent that they protect their own such information. 

42 

The impact of these continuously
evolving laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the way we use data to digitally market and pursue our customers,
as well as in our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

As a result of the acquisition
of Be My Neighbor, we are subject to additional laws and regulations that monitor the loan origination and servicing sectors, and rules
issued by the CFPB may increase our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs. 

Our mortgage brokerage subsidiary
is subject to the regulatory, supervisory and examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB ),
which has oversight of federal and state non-depository lending and servicing institutions, including residential mortgage originators
and loan servicers. The CFPB has rulemaking authority with respect to many of the federal consumer protection laws applicable to mortgage
lenders and servicers, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Fair Debt Collections Practices
Act. The CFPB has issued a number of regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act relating to loan origination and servicing activities,
including ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards and other origination standards and practices. 

The CFPB s examinations
have increased, and will likely continue to increase, our mortgage business administrative and compliance costs. They could also
greatly influence the availability and cost of residential mortgage credit and increase servicing costs and risks. These increased costs
of compliance, the effect of these rules on the lending industry and loan servicing, and any failure in our mortgage business s
ability to comply with the new rules by their effective dates, could be detrimental to their business. The CFPB also issued guidelines
on sending examiners to banks and other institutions that service and/or originate mortgages to assess whether consumers interests are
protected. The CFPB also has broad enforcement powers, and can order, among other things, rescission or reformation of contracts, the
refund of moneys or the return of real property, restitution, disgorgement or compensation for unjust enrichment, the payment of damages
or other monetary relief, public notifications regarding violations, limits on activities or functions, remediation of practices, external
compliance monitoring and civil money penalties. The CFPB has been active in investigations and enforcement actions and, when necessary,
has issued civil money penalties to parties the CFPB determines has violated the laws and regulations it enforces. 

Additionally, antidiscrimination
statutes, such as the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA ), prohibit creditors from discriminating
against loan applicants and borrowers based on certain characteristics, such as race, religion and national origin, among others. Various
federal regulatory agencies and departments, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the CFPB, take the position that these laws
apply not only to intentional discrimination, but also to neutral practices that have a disparate impact on a group that shares a characteristic
that a creditor may not consider in making credit decisions (i.e., creditor or servicing practices that have a disproportionate negative
effect on a protected class of individuals). These regulatory agencies, as well as consumer advocacy groups and plaintiffs attorneys,
are focusing greater attention on disparate impact claims. Regulatory agencies and private plaintiffs are expected to apply
the disparate impact theory to both the Fair Housing Act and ECOA in the context of mortgage lending and servicing,
among others. To the extent that the disparate impact theory continues to apply, it may significantly increase our administrative
burdens, compliance requirements and potential liability for failures to comply. 

Our mortgage business s
failure to comply with the federal consumer protection laws, rules and regulations to which they are subject, whether actual or alleged,
could expose them to enforcement actions or potential litigation liabilities. Moreover, if the CFPB or other regulatory authorities adopt
new rules governing the use of AI in mortgage underwriting or loan approval processes, we may face additional compliance obligations and
potential enforcement risks. Our inability to adapt to these regulatory changes in a timely and efficient manner could result in an adverse
effect to our business, financial condition and results of operations in our technology services segment. 

43 

We are subject to domestic and international
governmental export and import controls that may impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if
we are not in compliance with applicable laws or if we do not secure or maintain the required export authorizations. 

In many cases, our products
and services are or may in the future be subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations and subject to trade and economic sanctions
maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC ). We are also subject to export control and trade sanctions laws
and regulations in the EU, Singapore and other jurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries may operate. As such, an export license
may be required to export or re-export our technology and services to certain countries or end-users, or for certain end-uses, especially
AI technologies, such as those involving sensitive customer data or proprietary algorithms. If we were to fail to comply with such U.S.
export controls laws and regulations, U.S. economic sanctions, or other similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions, we could be
subject to both civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration for employees and managers for willful
violations, and the possible loss of our export or import privileges. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the
export of our services, including new releases and/or the performance of services, may create delays in the introduction of our services
in non-U.S. markets, prevent our customers with non-U.S. operations from deploying these services throughout their global systems or,
in some cases, prevent the export of the services to some countries altogether. 

Obtaining the necessary export
license for a particular sale or offering may not be possible, may be time-consuming, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.
In addition, compliance with the directives of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls DDTC may result in substantial
expenses and diversion of management attention. Any failure to adequately address the directives of DDTC could result in civil fines or
suspension or loss of our export privileges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results
of operations and growth prospects. Further, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions as well as similar laws and regulations in
other jurisdictions prohibit the export of offerings to certain U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, and persons, as well
as for prohibited end-uses. We may in the future fail to secure or maintain at all times all required export authorizations, which could
have negative consequences on our business, including reputational harm, government investigations and civil and criminal penalties. Additionally,
monitoring and ensuring compliance with these complex export control laws, regulations and sanctions may be particularly challenging as
we expand internationally and our offerings are distributed in non-U.S. countries. Any failure by us, our subsidiaries or our partners
to comply with all relevant export laws and regulations could have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government
investigations and penalties. 

Any change in domestic or
international export or import laws or regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing
export, import, or sanctions laws or regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such export,
import, or sanctions laws or regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell
access to our platform to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation
on our ability to export to or sell access to our platform in international markets would adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.
