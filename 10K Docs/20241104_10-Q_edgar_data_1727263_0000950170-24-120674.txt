in duration. We derive substantially all of our revenue from customers in the United States. We disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers into major customer acquisition channels. We determined that disaggregating revenue into these categories depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Revenue by major customer acquisition channel is as follows: 

Real estate (1) 

Direct-to-consumer (1) 

Other 

Total 

(1) 

Our home warranty contracts have one primary performance obligation, which is to provide for the repair or replacement of essential home systems and appliances, as applicable per the contract. We recognize revenue at the agreed upon contractual amount over time using the input method in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the contracts. Those costs bear a direct relationship to the fulfillment of our obligations under the contracts and are representative of the relative fair value of the services provided to the customer. As the costs to fulfill the obligations of the home warranties are incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis, we utilize historical evidence to estimate the expected claims expense and related timing of such costs and make a corresponding adjustment each period to the timing of our related revenue recognition. This adjustment to the straight-line revenue creates a contract asset or contract liability, as described under the heading Contract Assets and Liabilities below. We regularly review our estimates of claims costs and adjust these estimates when appropriate. Renewals Revenue from customer renewals of home warranty contracts, which were previously initiated in the real estate or direct-to-consumer channel are classified as renewal revenue above. Renewals relate to consecutive contract periods and take place at the end of the first year of a real estate or direct-to-consumer home warranty contract. Customer payments for renewals are primarily received in installments over the new contract period. Real estate Real estate home warranties are sold through annual contracts which occur in connection with a real estate sale. These plans are typically paid in full at closing on the real estate transaction. First-year revenue from the real estate channel is classified as real estate above. At the option of the customer, upon renewal of the contract, the future revenue derived from home warranties sold in this channel is classified as renewal revenue as described above. Direct-to-consumer Direct-to-consumer home warranties are sold through annual contracts which occur in response to our marketing efforts. Customer payments for direct-to-consumer sales are primarily received in installments over the contract period. First-year revenue from the direct-to-consumer channel is classified as direct-to-consumer above. At the option of the customer, upon renewal of the contract, the future revenue derived from home warranties sold in this channel is classified as renewal revenue as described above. Other Other revenue primarily includes revenue generated by on-demand home services, as well as administrative fees and ancillary services attributable to our home warranty contracts.

million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. There were impairment losses related to these capitalized costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Receivables, Less Allowance We record a receivable due from customers once we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to the services provided and anticipate the collection of amounts due to us. Contracts for home warranties may be invoiced upfront or monthly in straight-line installment payments over the contract period. The payment terms are determined prior to the execution of the contract. Contract Assets and Liabilities Contract assets arise when we recognize revenue for our home warranty contracts prior to a customer being invoiced. These timing differences are created when the recognition of revenue in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing the services under the contract are accelerated as compared to the recognition of revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Contract assets were million as of September 30, 2024. Our contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue which is recognized when cash payments are received in advance of the performance of services, including when the amounts are refundable. Amounts are recognized as revenue in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under our contracts.

, we entered into the Purchase Agreement to acquire 2-10 HBW for aggregate cash consideration of million, subject to certain customary adjustments based on, among other things, the amount of cash, debt, transaction expenses, working capital and regulatory capital in the business as of the closing of the transaction. 2-10 HBW is a leading provider of new home structural warranty protection plans, which are insurance-backed offerings that provide builders coverage for structural failures. 2-10 HBW also provides direct-to-consumer home warranties. The transaction is supported by a fully committed bridge facility under our existing Credit Agreement and cash. Permanent financing is expected to consist of new term loan borrowings. The applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, expired on July 17, 2024, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, and applicable regulators in Florida and the District of Columbia have approved the transaction subject to customary regulatory conditions. The transaction is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to additional regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. In conjunction with the 2-10 HBW Acquisition, we recognized acquisition-related costs of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These charges represent direct third-party costs, including legal, accounting and financial advisory fees. These charges are included in selling and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

to settle, on average, and substantially all claims are settled within of incurrence. The amount of time required to settle a claim can vary based on a number of factors, including whether a replacement is ultimately required. In addition to our estimates, we engage a third-party actuary to perform an accrual analysis utilizing generally accepted actuarial methods that incorporate cumulative historical claims experience and information provided by us. We regularly review our estimates of claims costs along with the third-party analysis and adjust our estimates when appropriate. We believe that utilizing actuarial methods in our estimation process to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these judgmental accruals. We have certain liabilities with respect to existing or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. We accrue for these liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Any resulting adjustments, which could be material, are recorded in the period the adjustments are identified. Due to the nature of our business activities, we are also at times subject to pending and threatened legal and regulatory actions that arise out of the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, based in part upon advice of legal counsel, the disposition of any such matters is not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, it is possible that our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more legal actions.

million and million, respectively, and the estimated fair values were million and million, respectively. The fair value of our debt was estimated based on available market prices for the same or similar instruments that are considered significant other observable inputs (Level 2) within the fair value hierarchy and was based on information available to us as of the respective period end dates. We determine the fair value of our interest rate swap contract using a forward interest rate curve obtained from a third-party market data provider. The fair value of the contract is the sum of the expected future settlements between the contract counterparties, discounted to present value. The expected future settlements are determined by comparing the contract interest rate to the expected forward interest rate as of each settlement date and applying the difference between these two rates to the notional amount of debt in the interest rate swap contract. We did not change our valuation techniques for measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Transfers between hierarchy levels, if any, are recognized at the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between hierarchy levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our interest rate swap contract is currently our only financial instrument remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis.

 Overview 
 Frontdoor is the leading provider of home warranties in the United States, as measured by revenue, and operates primarily under the American Home Shield brand. Our customizable home warranties help customers protect and maintain their homes, typically their most valuable asset, from costly and unplanned breakdowns of essential home systems and appliances. Our home warranty customers usually subscribe to an annual service plan agreement that covers the repair or replacement of major components of more than 20 home systems and appliances, including electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, water heaters, refrigerators, dishwashers and ranges/ovens/cooktops, as well as optional coverages for electronics, pools, spas and pumps. Frontdoor also provides on-demand home services and a one-stop app experience for home repair and maintenance. Enabled by our Streem technology, the Frontdoor app empowers homeowners by connecting them in real time through video chat with qualified experts to diagnose and solve their problems. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately two million active home warranties across all brands in the United States. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of 540 million, 100 million and 165 million, respectively, and 524 million, 71 million and 128 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of 1,461 million, 226 million and 394 million, respectively, and 1,414 million, 163 million and 302 million, respectively. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see Results of Operations Adjusted EBITDA. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total operating revenue included 78 percent of revenue derived from existing customer renewals, while seven percent and nine percent were derived from new home warranty sales made in conjunction with existing home real estate transactions and direct-to-consumer sales, respectively, and six percent was derived from other revenue channels. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our total operating revenue included 77 percent of revenue derived from existing customer renewals, while eight percent and 11 percent were derived from new home service plan sales made in conjunction with existing home real estate transactions and direct-to-consumer sales, respectively, and four percent was derived from other revenue channels. 
 
 Acquisition of 2-10 HBW 
 On June 3, 2024, we entered into the Purchase Agreement to acquire 2-10 HBW for aggregate cash consideration of 585 million, subject to certain customary adjustments based on, among other things, the amount of cash, debt, transaction expenses, working capital and regulatory capital in the business as of the closing of the transaction. 2-10 HBW is a leading provider of new home structural warranty protection plans, which are insurance-backed offerings that provide builders coverage for structural failures. 2-10 HBW also provides direct-to-consumer home warranties. The transaction is supported by a fully committed bridge facility under our existing Credit Agreement and cash. Permanent financing is expected to consist of new term loan borrowings. The applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, expired on July 17, 2024, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, and applicable regulators in Florida and the District of Columbia have approved the transaction subject to customary regulatory conditions. The transaction is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to additional regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.

Key Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Current macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, high interest rates, the challenging real estate market, and ongoing global geopolitical issues, may affect existing home sales, consumer sentiment or labor availability. These conditions may reduce demand for our services, increase our costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. While these macroeconomic conditions generally impact the United States as a whole, we believe our nationwide presence limits the impact on us of unfavorable economic conditions in any particular region of the United States. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our financial condition and results of operations continued to be adversely impacted by the following: 
 Challenging real estate market conditions, driven by a decline in the number of home resale transactions, primarily resulting from high interest rates combined with low home inventory levels, continue to constrain demand for home warranties. 

Consumer sentiment remains mixed as a result of a broad range of current macroeconomic conditions, including pressure on consumer prices and high interest rates. We believe this environment continues to impact demand for home warranties. 

Our labor, parts and equipment costs continue to be impacted by inflation. 

The ultimate implications of the current macroeconomic conditions on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain. It remains difficult to predict the overall continuing impact these conditions will have on our business as they may reduce demand for our services, increase our costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. 
 
 Seasonality 
 Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which drive variations in our revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA for interim periods. Seasonal fluctuations are primarily driven by a higher number of HVAC work orders in the summer months. In 2023, approximately 21 percent, 29 percent, 29 percent and 21 percent of our revenue, approximately 13 percent, 41 percent, 42 percent and five percent of our net income, and approximately 15 percent, 35 percent, 37 percent and 13 percent of our Adjusted EBITDA was recognized in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. 
 
 Effect of Weather Conditions 
 The demand for our services, and our results of operations, are affected by weather conditions. Extreme temperatures, typically in the winter and summer months, can lead to an increase in service requests related to home systems, particularly HVAC systems, resulting in higher costs and lower profitability, while mild temperatures in the winter or summer months can lead to lower home systems claim frequency, resulting in lower costs and higher profitability. For example, favorable weather trends in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 resulted in a lower number of service requests per customer in the HVAC trade, which favorably impacted contract claims costs. 
 While weather variations as described above may affect our business, major weather events and other similar Acts of God, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, wildfires or earthquakes, typically do not increase our obligations to provide service. Generally, repairs associated with such isolated events are addressed by homeowners and other forms of insurance as opposed to the home warranties that we offer. 
 
 Tariff and Import/Export Regulations 
 Changes in U.S. tariff and import/export regulations may impact the costs of parts, appliances and home systems. Import duties or restrictions on components and raw materials that are imposed, or the perception that they could occur, may materially and adversely affect our business by increasing our costs. For example, rising costs due to blanket tariffs on imported steel and aluminum could increase the costs of our parts, appliances and home systems. 
 
 20 

Competition 
 We compete in the U.S. home warranty category and the broader U.S. home services industry. The home warranty category is highly competitive. While we have a broad range of competitors in each locality and region, we are one of the few companies that provide home warranties nationwide. The broader U.S. home services industry is also highly competitive. We compete against businesses providing on-demand home services directly and those offering leads to contractors seeking to provide on-demand home services. The principal methods of competition, and by which we differentiate ourselves from our competitors, are quality and speed of service, contract offerings, brand awareness and reputation, customer satisfaction, pricing and promotions, contractor network and referrals. We believe our nationwide network of qualified professional contractor firms, in combination with our large base of contracted customers, differentiate us from other platforms in the home services industry. 
 
 Acquisition Activity 
 We anticipate that the highly fragmented nature of the home warranty category will continue to create strategic opportunities for acquisitions. Historically, we have used acquisitions to cost-effectively grow our customer base in high-growth geographies, and we intend to continue to do so. We have also used acquisitions to enhance our technological capabilities and geographic presence. We may also explore opportunities to make strategic acquisitions that will expand our service offering in the broader home services industry. For example, on June 3, 2024, we entered into the Purchase Agreement to acquire 2-10 HBW, a leading provider of new home structural warranty protection plans. See Acquisition of 2-10 HBW for additional information related to the pending acquisition. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have disclosed non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or adjust certain items. We present within this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. See Results of Operations Adjusted EBITDA for a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Liquidity and Capital Resources Free Cash Flow for a reconciliation of net cash provided from operating activities to Free Cash Flow, as well as Key Business Metrics for further discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, and Adjusted EBITDA is also a component of our incentive compensation program. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors, analysts and other interested parties useful information to evaluate our business performance as they facilitate company-to-company operating performance comparisons. Management believes Free Cash Flow is useful as a supplemental measure of our liquidity. Management uses Free Cash Flow to facilitate company-to-company cash flow comparisons, which may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to operating performance. While we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, they should be considered as supplemental in nature and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 
 Key Business Metrics 
 We focus on a variety of indicators and key operating and financial metrics to monitor the financial condition and performance of the continuing operations of our business. These metrics include: 
 revenue, 

operating expenses, 

gross profit, 

gross profit margin, 

net income, 

earnings per share, 

Adjusted EBITDA, 

Adjusted EBITDA margin, 

net cash provided from operating activities, 

Free Cash Flow, 

number of home warranties, and 

customer retention rate. 

21 

Revenue. The majority of our revenue is generated from home warranty contracts entered into with our customers. Home warranty contracts are typically one year in duration. We recognize revenue at the agreed upon contractual amount over time using the input method in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the contracts. Our revenue is primarily a function of the volume and pricing of the services provided to our customers, as well as the mix of services provided. Our revenue volume is impacted by new home warranty sales, customer retention and acquisitions. We derive substantially all of our revenue from customers in the United States. 
 
 Operating Expenses. In addition to changes in our revenue, our operating results are affected by, among other things, the level of our operating expenses. Our operating expenses primarily include contract claims costs and expenses associated with sales and marketing, customer service and general corporate overhead. A number of our operating expenses are subject to inflationary pressures, such as: salaries and wages, employee benefits and healthcare; contractor costs; parts, appliances and home systems costs; tariffs; insurance premiums; and various regulatory compliance costs. 
 
 Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin. The presentation of gross profit and gross profit margin provides measures of performance which are primarily a function of the revenue drivers discussed above and contract claims costs drivers, primarily contractor costs and parts, appliances and home systems costs. Gross profit is computed by deducting cost of services rendered from revenue. Gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of revenue. 
 
 Net Income and Earnings Per Share . The presentation of net income and basic and diluted earnings per share provides measures of performance which are useful for investors, analysts and other interested parties in company-to-company operating performance comparisons. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, increased to include the number of shares of common stock that would have been outstanding had potentially dilutive shares of common stock been issued. The dilutive effect, if any, of stock options, performance options (which are stock options that become exercisable upon the achievement, in whole or in part, of the applicable performance goals, pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Plan and the award agreement), RSUs, performance shares (which are contractual rights to receive a share of our common stock (or the cash equivalent thereof) upon the achievement, in whole or in part, of the applicable performance goals, pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Plan and the award agreement) and RSAs are reflected in diluted earnings per share by applying the treasury stock method. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. We evaluate our operating and financial performance primarily based on Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before: depreciation and amortization expense; goodwill and intangibles impairment; restructuring charges; acquisition-related costs; provision for income taxes; non-cash stock-based compensation expense; interest expense; loss on extinguishment of debt; and other non-operating expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful for investors, analysts and other interested parties as they facilitate company-to-company operating performance comparisons by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures, taxation, the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment, restructuring and acquisition initiatives and equity-based, long-term incentive plans. 
 
 Net Cash Provided from Operating Activities and Free Cash Flow. We focus on measures designed to monitor cash flow, including net cash provided from operating activities and Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and represents net cash provided from operating activities less property additions. 
 
 Number of Home Warranties and Customer Retention Rate. We report on our number of home warranties and customer retention rate as measurements of our operating performance. These measurements are presented on a rolling 12-month basis in order to avoid seasonal anomalies. The number of home warranties is representative of our recurring home warranty customer base and is measured as the number of customers with active contracts as of the respective period-end date. Our customer retention rate is calculated as the ratio of the number of end-of-period home warranty contracts to the sum of the number of beginning-of-period home warranty contracts and the number of new home warranty sales and acquired accounts during the respective period. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Revenue increased three percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in renewal revenue reflects improved price realization resulting from our prior pricing actions, offset, in part, by a decline in the number of renewed home warranties. The decreases in real estate revenue and direct-to-consumer revenue primarily reflect a decline in the number of home warranties driven by the challenging real estate market and the impact of inflation on consumer sentiment. The increase in other revenue was driven by growth in on-demand home services, primarily new HVAC sales.

The decrease in contract claims costs primarily reflects a lower number of service requests per customer, which was primarily driven by a favorable weather impact of 14 million, as milder weather drove a lower number of service requests in the HVAC trade. The decrease also included the impact of higher trade service fees, which favorably impacted the net cost per service request, and continued process improvements, specifically relating to better cost management across our contractor network. The decrease was offset, in part, by ongoing inflationary cost pressures. Additionally, contract claims costs reflects a 3 million favorable adjustment related to the development of prior period claims, compared to a 9 million favorable adjustment in the third quarter of 2023.

The decrease was offset, in part, by ongoing inflationary cost pressures. Additionally, contract claims costs reflects a 4 million favorable adjustment related to the development of prior period claims, compared to a 9 million favorable adjustment in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Selling and Administrative Expenses 
 We reported selling and administrative expenses of 154 million and 152 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 456 million and 439 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Acquisition-related costs are related to the 2-10 HBW Acquisition and represent direct third-party costs, including legal, accounting and financial advisory fees. Other general and administrative costs increased primarily due to increased personnel costs. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation expense was 9 million and 8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 26 million and 24 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amortization expense was 1 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and 2 million and 3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Restructuring Charges 
 We had restructuring charges of 3 million and 5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 5 million and 6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring charges include 3 million of severance costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring charges include 4 million of severance costs and 1 million of expenses related to the exit of certain operating leases. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, restructuring charges primarily include a 2 million impairment charge related to our Phoenix, Arizona customer service center s operating lease right-of-use asset and the related fixed assets and 2 million of professional fees, with the balance comprised of severance costs. The impairment charge was the result of our decision to exit the leased property. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 10 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and 29 million and 30 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Interest and Net Investment Income 
 Interest and net investment income was 5 million and 4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 15 million and 12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases were driven by higher interest rates on our cash and cash equivalent balances. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rate on income before income taxes was 25.1 percent and 25.3 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 25.3 percent and 25.1 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net Income 
 Net income was 100 million and 71 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 226 million and 163 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases were driven by the operating results discussed throughout Results of Operations above. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 165 million and 128 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 394 million and 302 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

(1) We exclude restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs from Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they do not reflect our ongoing operations and because we believe doing so is useful to investors in aiding period-to-period comparability. 

(2) We exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense from Adjusted EBITDA because it is a non-cash expense and because it is not used by management to assess ongoing operational performance. We believe excluding this expense from Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in aiding period-to-period comparability. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 A substantial portion of our liquidity needs are due to debt service requirements on our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit or restrict our ability, including the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, repurchase debt, incur liens, sell assets, make certain payments (including dividends) and enter into transactions with affiliates. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement. We do not believe current macroeconomic conditions will affect our ongoing ability to meet our debt covenants. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents totaled 375 million and 325 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents include balances associated with regulatory requirements in our business. See Limitations on Distributions and Dividends by Subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total net assets subject to these third-party restrictions were 161 million and 157 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there was 2 million of letters of credit outstanding under our 250 million Revolving Credit Facility, and the available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility was 248 million. The letters of credit are posted in lieu of cash to satisfy regulatory requirements in certain states in which we operate. We currently believe that cash generated from operations, our cash on hand, cash available from our committed financing arrangements and available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations in the short- and long-term, including the 2-10 HBW Acquisition. 
 
 We closely monitor the performance of our investment portfolio, primarily cash deposits. We regularly review the statutory reserve requirements to which our regulated entities are subject and any changes to such requirements. These reviews may result in identifying current reserve levels above or below minimum statutory reserve requirements, in which case we may adjust our reserves. The reviews may also identify opportunities to satisfy certain regulatory reserve requirements through alternate financial vehicles. 
 
 28 

We have a diversified investment strategy for our cash investments and give priority to the major financial institutions that serve as lenders under the Credit Agreement. Generally, our cash deposits may be redeemed on demand and are maintained with major financial institutions with solid credit ratings, although our holdings exceed insured limits in substantially all of our accounts. 
 
 We may, from time to time, issue new debt, repurchase or otherwise retire or extend our debt and/or take other steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position, gross and net leverage, results of operations or cash flows. These actions may include new debt issuance, open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other retirements of outstanding debt and/or opportunistic refinancing of debt. The amount of debt that may be issued, repurchased or otherwise retired or refinanced, if any, and the price of such issuances, repurchases, retirements or refinancings will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. 
 
 Acquisition of 2-10 HBW 
 On June 3, 2024, we entered into the Purchase Agreement to acquire 2-10 HBW for aggregate cash consideration of 585 million, subject to certain customary adjustments based on, among other things, the amount of cash, debt, transaction expenses, working capital and regulatory capital in the business as of the closing of the transaction. 2-10 HBW is a leading provider of new home structural warranty protection plans, which are insurance-backed offerings that provide builders coverage for structural failures. 2-10 HBW also provides direct-to-consumer home warranties. The transaction is supported by a fully committed bridge facility under our existing Credit Agreement and cash. Permanent financing is expected to consist of new term loan borrowings. The applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, expired on July 17, 2024, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, and applicable regulators in Florida and the District of Columbia have approved the transaction subject to customary regulatory conditions. The transaction is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to additional regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On July 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to 650 million of our common stock over the three-year period from September 4, 2024 through September 4, 2027. Purchases under this new 650 million repurchase program may be made from time to time by the company in the open market at prevailing market prices (including through a Rule 10b5-1 Plan), in privately negotiated transactions, or through any combination of these methods, through September 4, 2027. The actual timing, number, manner and value of any shares repurchased will depend on several factors, including the market price of the company s stock, general market and economic conditions, the company s liquidity requirements, applicable legal requirements and other business considerations. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any number of shares in any specific period or at all and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. As of September 30, 2024, we have not made any repurchases under this program. We expect to fund share repurchases from net cash provided from operating activities. 
 On September 7, 2021, we announced a three-year repurchase authorization of up to 400 million of outstanding shares of our common stock over the three-year period from September 3, 2021 through September 3, 2024. At the time of expiration, we repurchased a total of 11,319,091 outstanding shares at an aggregate cost of 400 million under this program, which is included in treasury stock on the condensed consolidated statements of financial position included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Limitations on Distributions and Dividends by Subsidiaries 
 We depend on our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us so that we may pay obligations and expenses, including satisfying obligations with respect to indebtedness. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions and dividends to us depends on their operating results, cash requirements, financial condition and general business conditions, as well as restrictions under the laws of our subsidiaries jurisdictions. 
 
 Our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of the Credit Agreement and other indebtedness to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions, the payment of dividends or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to us. 
 
 Furthermore, there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. The payments of ordinary and extraordinary dividends by certain of our subsidiaries (through which we conduct our business) are subject to significant regulatory restrictions under the laws and regulations of the states in which they operate. Among other things, such laws and regulations require certain subsidiaries to maintain minimum capital and net worth requirements and may limit the amount of ordinary and extraordinary dividends and other payments that these subsidiaries can pay to us. We expect that such limitations will be in effect for the foreseeable future. None of our subsidiaries are obligated to make funds available to us through the payment of dividends.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided from operating activities was 212 million and 139 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Net cash provided from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 comprised 281 million in earnings adjusted for non-cash charges, offset, in part, by 66 million in cash used for working capital and 3 million in payments for restructuring charges. Cash used for working capital was primarily driven by seasonality, payments of accrued bonuses and a decline in the number of first-year real estate home warranties, which are typically paid for upfront at the time of closing on the home sale. 
 
 Net cash provided from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 comprised 207 million in earnings adjusted for non-cash charges, offset, in part, by 68 million in cash used for working capital. Cash used for working capital was primarily driven by seasonality, favorable development of prior period claims and a decline in the number of first-year real estate home service plans, which are typically paid for upfront at the time of closing on the home sale. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities was 31 million and 23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Capital expenditures were 31 million and 23 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and included recurring capital needs and technology projects. We expect capital expenditures for the full year 2024 relating to committed, recurring capital needs and the continuation of investments in information systems and productivity enhancing technology to be approximately 40 million. Other than the pending acquisition of 2-10 HBW, we have no additional material capital commitments at this time. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used for financing activities was 131 million and 88 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made scheduled principal payments of debt of 13 million and purchased outstanding shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 120 million. Repurchases of common stock included associated commissions and taxes of 1 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made scheduled principal payments of debt of 13 million and purchased outstanding shares at an aggregate cost of 76 million.

 On June 3, 2024, we entered into the Purchase Agreement to acquire 2-10 HBW for aggregate cash consideration of 585 million, subject to certain customary adjustments based on, among other things, the amount of cash, debt, transaction expenses, working capital and regulatory capital in the business as of the closing of the transaction. The transaction is supported by a fully committed bridge facility under our existing Credit Agreement and cash. Permanent financing is expected to consist of new term loan borrowings.

 Financial Position 
 A summary of the significant changes in our financial position from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 is as follows: 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting cash provided from operating activities, offset, in part, by capital expenditures, scheduled principal payments of debt and purchases of outstanding shares. 

Contract assets increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting the recognition of monthly-pay customer revenue on an other-than-straight-line basis to match the timing of cost recognition. 

Accounts payable increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting the timing of trade payables driven by seasonality. 

Accrued liabilities Other increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting an increase in federal income tax payable. 

Deferred revenue decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting recognition of revenue on an other-than-straight-line basis to match the timing of cost recognition and a decline in the number of first-year real estate home service plans, which are typically paid for upfront at the time of closing on the home sale. 

Long-term debt decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting scheduled debt payments. 

Total shareholders equity was 261 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 136 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by net income, offset, in part, by repurchases of our common stock. See the condensed consolidated statements of changes in equity (deficit) included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and manage this exposure through the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing an interest rate swap. There have been no material changes to the market risk associated with debt obligations and other significant instruments from the risks described in Part II, Item 7A in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act) the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The information required with respect to this Part II, Item 1 can be found under Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 For information regarding factors that could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, see the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. Other than the following risks related to the 2-10 HBW Acquisition, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The risks described below and in our 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial could also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Acquisition of 2-10 Home Buyers Warranty 
 The acquisition may not achieve its intended results. 
 On June 3, 2024, we entered into a Purchase Agreement to acquire 2-10 HBW in an all cash transaction valued at 585 million, subject to certain customary adjustments based on, among other things, the amount of cash, debt, transaction expenses, working capital and regulatory capital in 2-10 HBW as of the closing of the acquisition, with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits, including, among other things, accelerating Frontdoor s growth trajectory, operating synergies, and a strengthened financial profile. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether our business and 2-10 HBW are integrated in an efficient and effective manner. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated by the combined company and diversion of management s attention and energy away from ongoing business concerns, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and performance, operating results and prospects. 
 Additional risks relating to the 2-10 HBW Acquisition and integration of 2-10 HBW into our business, include, among others, the following: 
 general economic and business conditions; 

potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen delays or regulatory conditions associated with the acquisition; 

our inability to successfully or timely integrate 2-10 HBW in a manner that permits us to achieve the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition; 

disruption to our and 2-10 HBW s business and operations and relationships with service providers, customers, employees and other partners; 

32 

diversion of significant resources from our core product offerings; 

our inability to retain the service of key management and other personnel of 2-10 HBW; 

our ability to effectively diversify and expand into a new line of business and execute on cross-selling opportunities for home warranties and our on-demand services; 

our inability to successfully integrate 2-10 HBW into our internal control over financial reporting, which could compromise the integrity of our financial reporting; and 

greater than anticipated costs related to the integration of 2-10 HBW s business and operations into ours. 

These potential difficulties, some of which are outside of our control, could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. We cannot guarantee that we will achieve our goals or meet our expectations with respect to the acquisition. The full benefits of the 2-10 HBW Acquisition, including the anticipated financial benefits, synergies and growth opportunities, may not be realized as expected or may not be achieved within the anticipated timeframe, or at all. If our assumptions are inaccurate or we are unable to meet our expectations, our business, financial performance and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the market price of our common stock may decline if our assumptions regarding the anticipated benefits of the acquisition are not accurate or we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or at all. 
 Notwithstanding the due diligence investigation that we performed in connection with our entry into the Purchase Agreement, 2-10 HBW may have liabilities, losses, or other exposures for which we do not have adequate insurance coverage, indemnification, or other protection. 
 While we performed due diligence on 2-10 HBW prior to our entry into the Purchase Agreement, we are dependent on the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by 2-10 HBW and its representatives during due diligence and during our evaluation of the results of such due diligence. We did not control 2-10 HBW and may be unaware of certain activities of 2-10 HBW before the completion of the acquisition, including those related to other litigation claims or disputes, information security vulnerabilities, violations of laws, policies, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities. 
 Following the completion of the 2-10 HBW Acquisition, the liabilities of 2-10 HBW, including contingent liabilities, will be consolidated with the Company s. If 2-10 HBW s liabilities are greater than expected, or if 2-10 HBW has obligations of which we are not aware, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We do not have indemnification rights from the prior owners of 2-10 HBW and instead rely on a limited amount of representation and warranty insurance. Such insurance is subject to exclusions, policy limits and certain other customary terms and conditions. 2-10 HBW may also have other unknown liabilities. If we are responsible for liabilities not covered by insurance, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 In the event that the Purchase Agreement is validly terminated in connection with a failure to receive applicable government regulatory approvals in certain circumstances as described in the Purchase Agreement, we will be required to pay a termination fee of 30 million. 
 Our ability to consummate the 2-10 HBW Acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including the expiration or earlier termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (the "HSR Waiting Period") and receipt of certain other specified governmental regulatory approvals (collectively, the Government Approvals ). Subject to certain exceptions, the Company and 2-10 HBW have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain required Government Approvals. If the Purchase Agreement is validly terminated in connection with a failure to receive applicable Government Approvals in certain circumstances as described in the Purchase Agreement, we will be required to pay 2-10 HBW a termination fee of 30 million dollars. While the HSR Waiting Period expired on July 17, 2024, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time and applicable regulators in Florida and the District of Columbia have approved the transaction subject to customary regulatory conditions, the 2-10 HBW Acquisition remains subject to other Government Approvals. 
 33 

Completion of the 2-10 HBW Acquisition is subject to conditions, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the acquisition will not be completed. 
 Each of our and 2-10 HBW s obligation to complete the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, which include, among others, the receipt of Government Approvals; the accuracy of the parties respective representations and warranties, subject to certain bring-down standards; material performance of the parties obligations under the Purchase Agreement; and, with respect to the Company s obligation to complete the acquisition, the absence of a material adverse effect on 2-10 HBW. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions in the Purchase Agreement could delay the completion of the acquisition or prevent the acquisition from occurring. Any delay in completing the acquisition could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve even if the acquisition is successfully completed within the expected timeframe. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that the acquisition will be completed, or as to whether the acquisition will be completed on terms other than those set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Failure to complete the acquisition could adversely impact the price of shares of our common stock. 
 Financing the 2-10 HBW Acquisition will result in an increase in our indebtedness, which could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense. 
 We intend to finance a portion of the 585 million purchase price and related fees and expenses of the 2-10 HBW Acquisition with 575 million of borrowings under a senior secured incremental term loan facility under our existing Credit Agreement. This increase in our indebtedness may, among other things, reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditures or working capital needs. In addition, the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness, and thus the demands on our cash resources, will materially increase as a result of the indebtedness to finance the acquisition. For further discussion of risks related to our indebtedness, see Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Indebtedness in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 On July 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to 650 million of our common stock over the three-year period from September 4, 2024 through September 4, 2027. Purchases under this new 650 million repurchase program may be made from time to time by the company in the open market at prevailing market prices (including through a Rule 10b5-1 Plan), in privately negotiated transactions, or through any combination of these methods, through September 4, 2027. The actual timing, number, manner and value of any shares repurchased will depend on several factors, including the market price of the company s stock, general market and economic conditions, the company s liquidity requirements, applicable legal requirements and other business considerations. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any number of shares in any specific period or at all and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. As of September 30, 2024, we have not made any repurchases under this program. 
 On September 7, 2021, we announced a three-year repurchase authorization of up to 400 million of outstanding shares of our common stock over the three-year period from September 3, 2021 through September 3, 2024. At the time of expiration, we repurchased a total of 11,319,091 outstanding shares at an aggregate cost of 400 million under this program.
