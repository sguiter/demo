During the first two quarters of 2024, the Company repurchased million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Senior Notes at a discount to par. In connection with these purchases, the Company recorded a net Gain on Debt Retirement of million. Term Loan In August 2024, the Company repaid in full all outstanding amounts under the Third Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement, dated as of June 6, 2022 (the Term Loan Agreement ), by and among the Company, Wells Fargo National Bank, as administrative agent, and the lenders from time to time party thereto.

Simultaneously with such repayment, the Company permanently terminated the lenders commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility in accordance with the terms thereof. At the time of termination of the lenders commitments, there were no revolving loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company was required to comply with certain covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility relating to total outstanding indebtedness, secured indebtedness, value of unencumbered real estate assets and fixed charge coverage. The Company was in compliance with these financial covenants through the termination date. In conjunction with the termination, the Company recorded million in Debt Extinguishment Costs.

, subject to two one-year extensions at the Borrowers option (subject to satisfaction of certain conditions) . The interest rate applicable to the Notes is equal to 30-day term SOFR (subject to a rate index floor of plus a spread of per annum. During the continuance of an event of default, the contract rate of interest on the Notes will increase to the lesser of (i) above the interest rate then otherwise applicable. The Mortgage Facility is structured as an interest only loan throughout the initial two-year term and any exercised extension periods. The principal amount outstanding under the Mortgage Facility may be prepaid in whole or in part by the Borrowers at any time without penalty, provided that prepayments made prior to the first anniversary of the closing date in excess of of the initial principal amount of the Mortgage Facility will be subject to Borrowers payment of a spread maintenance premium equal to per annum based on the number of days remaining prior to the first anniversary of the closing date. So long as no default then exists and subject to other customary release conditions, the Borrowers may cause the Lenders to release Properties from the Mortgage Facility in connection with their sale by paying of the initial loan amount allocated to such Property (plus the spread maintenance premium, if applicable) provided that after giving effect to such release, the debt yield of the remaining Properties is equal to or greater than (i) the debt yield on the Mortgage Facility s closing date and (ii) the debt yield in effect immediately prior to such release. All rents received from the Properties will be deposited into lockbox accounts in the name of the Borrowers for the benefit of and controlled by the Lenders. So long as no Trigger Period (as defined below) is continuing, Borrowers shall have control over all funds in such lockbox accounts. During a Trigger Period, substantially all amounts in the lockbox accounts will be remitted to a cash management account controlled by the Lenders on a daily basis and will be used by the Lenders to fund monthly debt service, real estate taxes, insurance, required reserves, other amounts owing to the Lenders and other property-level operating costs, with all remaining amounts to be held by the Lenders as additional collateral for the Mortgage Facility. of the then outstanding principal amount of the loan (but in no event less than million) and (ii) minimum liquid assets of not less than of the then outstanding principal amount of the loan (but in no event less than million).

Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan 

Mortgage Indebtedness 

Items Measured on Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The Company maintained a swap agreement (included in Other Assets) measured at a fair value on a recurring basis of million at December 31, 2023. In August 2024, the swap agreement was terminated. The estimated fair value was determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. In addition, credit valuation adjustments, which consider the impact of any credit enhancements to the contract, are incorporated in the fair value to account for potential non-performance risk, including the Company s own non-performance risk and the respective counterparty s non-performance risk. The valuation techniques used by the Company to determine such fair value fell within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company may use swaps and caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. The swaps designated as cash flow hedges involved the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Prior to the termination and repayment of amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement (Note 5) on August 15, 2024, the Company had one effective swap with a notional amount of million, expiring in , which converted the variable-rate SOFR component of the interest rate applicable to its term loan to a fixed rate of . In August of 2024, in conjunction with the repayment of the Term Loan Agreement (Note 5), the swap was terminated and re-designated to convert the variable-rate SOFR component of the interest rate applicable to million of the loan outstanding under the new Mortgage Facility to a fixed rate of . At the time or termination, the Company received a cash payment of million and the fair value of the derivative remaining in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income was million. This amount will be subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction is probable of affecting earnings. All components of the swap were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The Company expects to reflect within the next 12 months, a decrease to interest expense (and a corresponding increase to earnings) of approximately million. Derivative Unsecured Notes In 2023, the Company entered into swaption agreements with a notional amount aggregating million to partially hedge the impact of changes in benchmark interest rates on potential yield maintenance premiums applicable to the redemption of its Senior Notes due in 2027. The swaptions did not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, these derivative instruments were recorded in the Company s consolidated balance sheets at fair market value, with changes in value recorded through earnings as of each balance sheet date until exercise or expiration. In August 2024, the swaption agreements were terminated and the Company received a cash payment of million. The Company reported a non-cash loss of million and million, respectively, related to the valuation adjustments associated with these instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is recorded in Loss on derivative instruments on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 million, based on the difference between the carrying value of the assets and the estimated fair market value. The impairment charges recorded were triggered by a change in the hold period assumptions. Items Measured at Fair Value The Company is required to assess the fair value of certain impaired consolidated investments. The valuation of impaired real estate assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each asset, as well as the income capitalization approach considering prevailing market capitalization rates, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties and/or consideration of the amount that currently would be required to replace the asset, as adjusted for obsolescence. In general, the Company considers multiple valuation techniques when measuring fair value of an investment. However, in certain circumstances, a single valuation technique may be appropriate.

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 The Company is a self-administered and self-managed Real Estate Investment Trust REIT in the business of owning, leasing, acquiring, redeveloping, developing and managing shopping centers. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s portfolio consisted of 112 shopping centers (including 11 shopping centers owned through unconsolidated joint ventures).

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in net income attributable to common shareholders, as compared to the prior-year period, primarily was the result of the gains from dispositions of real estate recognized in 2024 and an increase in interest income, partially offset by the impact of net property dispositions, the write-off of fees related to the Mortgage Commitment (defined below), debt extinguishment costs, Curbline (defined below) spin-off transaction costs and impairment charges. 
 Curbline Spin-Off 
 In October 2023, the Company announced a plan to spin off a portfolio of convenience retail assets into a separate, publicly traded company to be named Curbline Properties Corp. Curbline or Curbline Properties in recognition of the distinct characteristics and opportunities within the Company s unanchored and grocery, lifestyle and power center portfolios. Convenience properties are generally positioned on the curbline of well-trafficked intersections, and major vehicular corridors, offering enhanced access and visibility along with dedicated parking and often include drive-thru units. The properties generally consist of a homogeneous row of primarily small-shop units leased to a diversified mixture of national and local service and restaurant tenants that cater to daily convenience trips from the growing suburban population. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Curbline portfolio consisted of 79 wholly-owned convenience retail assets consisting of approximately 2.7 million square feet of GLA. The separation of Curbline was completed on October 1, 2024. 
 On October 1, 2024, the Company, Curbline and Curbline Properties LP (the Operating Partnership entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement (the Separation and Distribution Agreement ), which provided for the principal transactions necessary to consummate the spin-off, including the allocation among the Company, Curbline and the Operating Partnership of the Company s assets, liabilities and obligations attributable to periods both prior to and following the spin-off. In particular, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provided, among other things, that certain assets relating to Curbline s business were to be transferred to the Operating Partnership or the applicable Curbline subsidiary, including equity interests of certain Company subsidiaries that held assets and liabilities related to Curbline, interests in real property, certain tangible personal property, cash and cash equivalents held in Curbline accounts (including the transfer to Curbline of unrestricted cash of 800.0 million upon consummation of the spin-off) and other assets primarily used or held primarily for use in Curbline s business. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also provided that certain liabilities relating to Curbline s business were to be transferred to the Operating Partnership or the applicable Curbline subsidiary, including liabilities relating to or arising out of the operation of Curbline s business after the effective time of the spin-off 
 19 

and liabilities expressly allocated to Curbline or one of its subsidiaries by the Separation and Distribution Agreement or certain other agreements entered into in connection with the spin-off. 
 Additionally, the Separation and Distribution Agreement contains provisions that obligate the Company to complete certain redevelopment projects at properties that are owned by Curbline. As of September 30, 2024, these redevelopment projects were estimated to cost 33.7 million to complete. 
 On October 1, 2024, the Company, Curbline and the Operating Partnership also entered into a Shared Services Agreement (the Shared Services Agreement ), which provides that, subject to the supervision of the Company s Board of Directors and executives, the Operating Partnership or its affiliates will provide the Company (i) leadership and management services that are of a nature customarily performed by leadership and management overseeing the business and operation of a REIT similarly situated to the Company, including supervising various business functions of the Company necessary for the day-to-day management operations of the Company and its affiliates and (ii) transaction services that are of a nature customarily performed by a dedicated transactions team within an organization similarly situated to the Company, including the provision of personnel at both the leadership and operational levels necessary to ensure effective and efficient preparation, negotiation, execution and implementation of real estate transactions, as well as overseeing post-transaction activities and alignment with the Company s strategic objectives. It is expected that the Operating Partnership or its affiliates will provide the Company with a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer but that the Company will employ its own Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and General Counsel. 
 The Shared Services Agreement also requires the Company to provide the Operating Partnership and its affiliates the services of its employees and the use or benefit of the Company s assets, offices and other resources as may be necessary or useful to establish and operate various business functions of the Operating Partnership and its affiliates in a manner as would be established and operated for a REIT similarly situated to Curbline. 
 The Operating Partnership will have the authority to supervise the employees of the Company and its affiliates and direct and control the day-to-day activities of such employees while such employees are providing services to the Operating Partnership or its affiliates under the Shared Services Agreement. 
 The Operating Partnership will pay the Company a fee in the aggregate amount of 2.0 of Curbline s Gross Revenue (as defined in the Shared Services Agreement) during the term of the Shared Services Agreement to be paid in monthly installments each month in arrears no later than the tenth calendar day of each month based upon Curbline s Gross Revenue for the prior month. There is no separate fee paid by the Company in connection with the provision of services by the Operating Partnership or its affiliates under the Shared Services Agreement. Unless terminated earlier, the term of the Shared Services Agreement will expire on October 1, 2027. In the event of certain early terminations of the Shared Services Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay a termination fee to the Operating Partnership equal to 2.5 million multiplied by the number of whole or partial fiscal quarters remaining in the Shared Services Agreement s three-year term (or 12.0 million in the event the Company terminates the agreement for convenience on its second anniversary). 
 The Company, Curbline and the Operating Partnership also entered into a tax matters agreement, which governs the rights, responsibilities and obligations of the parties following the spin-off with respect to various tax matters and provides for the allocation of tax-related assets, liabilities and obligations. In addition, the Company, Curbline and the Operating Partnership entered into an employee matters agreement, which governs the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations of the parties following the spin-off with respect to transitioning employees, equity plans and retirement plans, health and welfare benefits, and other employment, compensation, and benefit-related matters. 
 SITE Centers Strategy 
 From July 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024, the Company generated approximately 3.1 billion of gross proceeds from sales of properties for the purpose of acquiring additional convenience properties, capitalizing Curbline and, together with proceeds from the closing and funding of the Mortgage Facility (defined below), redeeming and/or repaying all of the Company s outstanding unsecured indebtedness. As of October 1, 2024, the Company had completed the sale of substantially all of the properties that had been in its active disposition pipeline prior to the spin-off of Curbline. Going forward, the Company intends to realize value through operations and to consider various factors, including market conditions and differences between the public and private valuations of its portfolio, in evaluating whether and when to pursue additional asset sales. The timing of any additional sales may also be impacted by interim leasing, tactical redevelopment activities and other asset management initiatives intended to maximize value. The Company expects to use proceeds from any additional asset sales to repay outstanding indebtedness and make distributions to shareholders. 
 The Company expects that rental income and net income will decrease in future periods as a result of the spin-off of Curbline and the significant volume of dispositions completed in recent quarters. The Company expects that its future dividend policy will be influenced by operations and asset sales, though the Company s distribution of any sale proceeds to shareholders will be subject to 
 20 

restrictions set forth in the terms of the Company s indebtedness and management of liquidity and overall leverage levels in connection with ongoing operations. 
 Company Activity 
 Growth opportunities within the Company s portfolio include rental rate increases, continued lease up of the portfolio, rent commencement with respect to recently executed leases and the adaptation of existing site plans and square footage to generate higher blended rental rates and operating cash flows. 
 Transactional and investment highlights for the Company through October 25, 2024, in addition to the Curbline spin-off, include the following: 
 Acquired 13 convenience centers and a fee interest in a land parcel in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of 193.6 million, as well as the joint venture partner s 80 interest in a property in North Carolina (Meadowmont Village) for 35.4 million; 

Sold 40 wholly-owned shopping centers (excluding certain retained convenience parcels), a parcel at a shopping center and two joint venture assets for an aggregate sales price of 2,325.9 million 2,261.3 million at the Company s share); 

Effected a reverse stock split of its common shares at a ratio of one-for-four; 

Closed and funded a 530.0 million Mortgage Facility which had an outstanding principal balance of 206.9 million as of September 30, 2024; 

Repaid in full the 200.0 million Term Loan (defined below) and terminated the Revolving Credit Facility (defined below) and recorded associated debt extinguishment costs of 0.9 million and 3.9 million, respectively; 

Repurchased 88.3 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes due in 2025, 2026 and 2027 (the Senior Notes for total cash consideration including expenses of 87.1 million and recorded a gain on debt retirement of 1.0 million; 

Redeemed all of its remaining outstanding Senior Notes for total cash consideration including expenses of 1,223.0 million and recorded debt extinguishment costs of 6.7 million; 

Repaid two wholly-owned mortgages due in 2025 for 25.5 million in aggregate and a joint venture mortgage loan for DDRM Properties Joint Venture due in 2024 for 40.9 million 8.2 million at the Company s share) and 

Provided notice of its intent to redeem all of its outstanding 6.375 Class A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares and the associated depositary shares. In connection with the redemption, the Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately 6.1 million to net income attributable to common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

Operational Accomplishments 
 The Company believes its recent strong leasing results are attributable to national tenants strong financial positions and increasing emphasis and reliance on physical store locations and the concentration of the Company s portfolio in primarily suburban, high household income communities which have witnessed significant population growth, changes in remote work and work-from-home trends, and limited new construction of competing retail properties. 
 Operational highlights for the Company through September 30, 2024, include the following: 
 Total portfolio average annualized base rent per square foot increased to 24.83 at September 30, 2024, as compared to 20.35 at December 31, 2023 and 20.20 at September 30, 2023, all on a pro rata basis; 

The aggregate occupancy of the Company s operating shopping center portfolio was 91.1 at September 30, 2024, as compared to 92.0 at December 31, 2023 and 92.2 at September 30, 2023, all on a pro rata basis and 

Leased approximately 2.3 million square feet of GLA, including 55 new leases and 208 renewals for a total of 263 leases. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has addressed substantially all of its remaining 2024 lease expirations. 

The comparability of year-over-year and period-over-period operating metrics have been increasingly impacted by the level and composition of the Company s disposition activities.

(A) The reduction of income is the result of gains recognized in 2023 from joint venture assets sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the DDRM Properties Joint Venture sold five shopping centers for an aggregate sales price of 112.2 million 22.4 million at the Company s share). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the DDRM Properties Joint Venture sold one shopping center for 36.5 million 7.3 million at the Company s share) in addition to selling its remaining asset to the Company for 44.2 million 35.4 million at the Company s share), for which the Company recorded a Gain on sale and change in control of interest. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had an economic investment in unconsolidated joint ventures which owned 11 and 13 shopping center properties, respectively. Joint venture property sales could significantly impact the amount of income or loss recognized in future periods and the amount of sale proceeds allocated to the Company may vary based on joint venture return calculations and promoted structures. 

(B) In May 2024, the Company acquired its partner s 80 interest in one asset previously owned by the DDRM Properties Joint Venture (Meadowmont Village, Chapel Hill, North Carolina) for 35.4 million and stepped up its 20 interest due to change in control. In 2023, the Company recorded a gain related to additional proceeds received related to an unconsolidated joint venture that sold its sole asset, a parcel of undeveloped land in Richmond Hill, Ontario, which was considered contingent at the time of the sale. 

(C) The Company sold 40 wholly-owned shopping centers (excluding certain retained convenience parcels) and one parcel at a wholly-owned shopping center in 2024. See Sources and Uses of Capital included elsewhere herein.

The increase in net income attributable to SITE Centers, as compared to the prior-year period, was primarily the result of the gains from dispositions and higher interest income, partially offset by the impact of net property dispositions, debt extinguishment costs (including the write-off of fees related to the Mortgage Commitment), Curbline Properties spin-off transaction costs and impairment charges. 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 Funds from Operations and Operating Funds from Operations 
 Definition and Basis of Presentation 
 The Company believes that Funds from Operations FFO and Operating FFO, both non-GAAP financial measures, provide additional and useful means to assess the financial performance of REITs. FFO and Operating FFO are frequently used by the real estate industry, as well as securities analysts, investors and other interested parties, to evaluate the performance of REITs. The Company also believes that FFO and Operating FFO more appropriately measure the core operations of the Company and provide benchmarks to its peer group. 
 FFO excludes GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate investments, which assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market 
 25 

conditions, and many companies use different depreciable lives and methods. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate and gains and losses from property dispositions, it can provide a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, interest costs and acquisition, disposition and development activities. This provides a perspective of the Company s financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 FFO is generally defined and calculated by the Company as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), adjusted to exclude (i) preferred share dividends, (ii) gains and losses from disposition of real estate property and related investments, which are presented net of taxes, (iii) impairment charges on real estate property and related investments, (iv) gains and losses from changes in control and (v) certain non-cash items. These non-cash items principally include real property depreciation and amortization of intangibles, equity income from joint ventures and equity income from non-controlling interests and adding the Company s proportionate share of FFO from its unconsolidated joint ventures and non-controlling interests, determined on a consistent basis. The Company s calculation of FFO is consistent with the definition of FFO provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). 
 The Company believes that certain charges, income and gains/losses recorded in its operating results are not comparable or reflective of its core operating performance. Operating FFO is useful to investors as the Company removes non-comparable charges, income and gains/losses to analyze the results of its operations and assess performance of the core operating real estate portfolio. As a result, the Company also computes Operating FFO and discusses it with the users of its financial statements, in addition to other measures such as net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP and FFO. Operating FFO is generally defined and calculated by the Company as FFO excluding certain charges, income and gains/losses that management believes are not comparable and indicative of the results of the Company s operating real estate portfolio. Such adjustments include write-off of preferred share original issuance costs, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt, mark to market on derivative instruments, certain transaction fee income, transaction costs and other restructuring type costs, including employee separation costs. The disclosure of these adjustments is regularly requested by users of the Company s financial statements. 
 The adjustment for these charges, income and gains/losses may not be comparable to how other REITs or real estate companies calculate their results of operations, and the Company s calculation of Operating FFO differs from NAREIT s definition of FFO. Additionally, the Company provides no assurances that these charges, income and gains/losses are non-recurring. These charges, income and gains/losses could be reasonably expected to recur in future results of operations. 
 These measures of performance are used by the Company for several business purposes and by other REITs. The Company uses FFO and/or Operating FFO in part (i) as a disclosure to improve the understanding of the Company s operating results among the investing public, (ii) as a measure of a real estate asset company s performance, (iii) to influence acquisition, disposition and capital investment strategies and (iv) to compare the Company s performance to that of other publicly traded shopping center REITs. 
 For the reasons described above, management believes that FFO and Operating FFO provide the Company and investors with an important indicator of the Company s operating performance. They provide recognized measures of performance other than GAAP net income, which may include non-cash items (often significant). Other real estate companies may calculate FFO and Operating FFO in a different manner. 
 Management recognizes the limitations of FFO and Operating FFO when compared to GAAP s net income. FFO and Operating FFO do not represent amounts available for dividends, capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties. Management does not use FFO or Operating FFO as an indicator of the Company s cash obligations and funding requirements for future commitments, acquisitions or development activities. Neither FFO nor Operating FFO represents cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and neither is necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Neither FFO nor Operating FFO should be considered an alternative to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. FFO and Operating FFO are simply used as additional indicators of the Company s operating performance. The Company believes that to further understand its performance, FFO and Operating FFO should be compared with the Company s reported net income (loss) and considered in addition to cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP, as presented in its consolidated financial statements. Reconciliations of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure of net income (loss) have been provided below.

 LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES 
 The Company requires capital to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditures. The Company s primary capital sources include cash flow from operations, debt financings and proceeds from asset sales. The Company remains committed to monitoring the duration of its indebtedness, to maintaining prudent leverage levels in an effort to manage its overall risk profile while maintaining strategic flexibility and to closely monitoring liquidity and its cash position following the termination of its Revolving Credit Facility in August 2024. 
 The Company s consolidated and unconsolidated debt obligations generally require monthly payments of principal and/or interest over the term of the obligation. While the Company currently believes it has several options to obtain capital and fund its business, no assurance can be provided that these obligations will be refinanced or repaid as currently anticipated. Any new debt financings may also entail higher rates of interest than the indebtedness being refinanced, which could have an adverse effect on the Company s operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The Company expects that redevelopment activities and capital expenditures will generally be financed through cash provided from operating activities and asset sales. Total consolidated debt outstanding was 0.3 billion and 1.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had an unrestricted cash balance of 1,063.1 million of which 800.0 million was used to capitalize Curbline Properties, approximately 21.0 million is expected to be used in the fourth quarter to pay outstanding transaction expenses relating to the spin-off of Curbline and approximately 176.3 million is expected to be used in November to redeem all of the Company s outstanding preferred shares and associated depositary shares. The Company has addressed all of its consolidated debt maturing in 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company anticipates that it has approximately 33.7 million to be incurred to complete redevelopment projects at properties owned by Curbline pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to operate its business at this time. 
 Termination of Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan 
 On August 15, 2024, the Company terminated all of the lenders commitments under its unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Revolving Credit Facility and paid all related fees and expenses then outstanding. At the time of termination of the lenders commitments, there were no loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 On August 15, 2024, the Company also repaid in full all outstanding amounts under its unsecured term loan with a syndicate of financial institutions and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the Term Loan ). At the time of the repayment, the principal amount of the Term Loan was approximately 200.0 million. 
 28 

Repayment of Other Senior Unsecured Indebtedness 
 On August 21, 2024, the Company redeemed the entire outstanding principal amount of its 4.700 Notes due 2027 448.3 million). On August 23, 2024, the Company redeemed the entire outstanding principal amount of its 3.625 Notes due 2025 400.4 million) and 4.250 Notes due 2026 370.1 million). 
 Mortgage Facility 
 On August 7, 2024, the Company closed and funded a 530.0 million mortgage loan (the Mortgage Facility provided by affiliates of Atlas SP Partners, L.P. and Athene Annuity and Life Company (collectively, the Lenders ). The Company used proceeds from the closing together with cash on hand from asset sales to repay its outstanding senior unsecured indebtedness as described above and to capitalize Curbline. 
 In connection with the Mortgage Facility s closing, certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, the Borrowers delivered certain promissory notes (collectively, the Notes evidencing their obligation to pay principal, interest and other amounts under the Mortgage Facility. The Notes are secured by, among other things, mortgages encumbering the Borrowers respective properties (a total of 23 properties at closing) (the Properties and related personal property, leases and rents. 
 The Mortgage Facility will mature on September 6, 2026 subject to two one-year extensions at the Borrowers option (subject to satisfaction of certain conditions). The interest rate applicable to the Notes is equal to 30-day term SOFR (subject to a rate index floor of 3.50 plus a spread of 2.75 per annum. The Borrowers are required to maintain an interest rate cap with respect to the principal amount of the Notes having a 30-day term SOFR strike rate equal to 6.25 . During the continuance of an event of default, the contract rate of interest on the Notes will increase to the lesser of (i) the maximum rate allowed by law or (ii) 4 above the interest rate then otherwise applicable. 
 The Mortgage Facility is structured as an interest only loan throughout the initial two-year term and any exercised extension periods. The principal amount outstanding under the Mortgage Facility may be prepaid (in whole or in part) by the Borrowers at any time without penalty, provided that prepayments made prior to the first anniversary of the closing date in excess of 35 of the initial principal amount of the Mortgage Facility will be subject to the Borrowers payment of a spread maintenance premium equal to 2.75 per annum based on the number of days remaining prior to the first anniversary of the closing date. So long as no event of default then exists and subject to other customary release conditions, the Borrowers may cause the Lenders to release Properties from the Mortgage Facility in connection with their sale by paying 115 of the initial loan amount allocated to such Property (plus the spread maintenance premium, if applicable) provided that after giving effect to such release the debt yield of the remaining Properties is equal to or greater than (i) the debt yield on the Mortgage Facility s closing date and (ii) the debt yield in effect immediately prior to such release. 
 All Property rents will be deposited into lockbox accounts in the name of the Borrowers for the benefit of and controlled by the Lenders. So long as no Trigger Period (as defined below) is continuing, Borrowers shall have control over all funds in such lockbox accounts. During a Trigger Period, substantially all amounts in the lockbox accounts will be remitted to a cash management account controlled by the Lenders on a daily basis and will be used by the Lenders to fund monthly debt service, real estate taxes, insurance, required reserves, other amounts owing to the Lenders and other property-level operating costs, with all remaining amounts to be held by the Lenders as additional collateral for the Mortgage Facility. A Trigger Period commences (i) upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Mortgage Facility (and ends upon the cure or waiver of the event of default); (ii) when the debt yield falls below 10.5 (and ends when the debt yield exceeds 10.5 for one calendar quarter); or (iii) upon any bankruptcy action with respect to any Borrower or manager of a Property that has not been discharged within 60 days of filing. 
 Throughout the term of the Mortgage Facility, the Company is required to maintain (i) a net worth of not less than 15 of the then outstanding principal amount of the loan (but in no event less than 100.0 million) and (ii) minimum liquid assets of not less than 5 of the then outstanding principal amount of the loan (but in no event less than 15.0 million). 
 The Company is required to comply with certain other covenants under the Mortgage Facility. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Mortgage Facility had an outstanding principal balance of 206.9 million and was secured by 13 Properties. 
 Termination of Mortgage Commitment 
 In connection with the Mortgage Facility s closing, the Company terminated the commitment (the Mortgage Commitment that it had obtained from the Lenders in October 2023 to provide a 1.1 billion financing secured by 40 of the Company s properties. 
 29 

Consolidated Indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 
 In addition to amounts outstanding under the Mortgage Facility, the Company had outstanding consolidated indebtedness at September 30, 2024 of 100.0 million, which consisted of a mortgage loan encumbering one property (Nassau Park Pavilion, Princeton, New Jersey), maturing in November 2028. 
 Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Mortgage Indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 
 The outstanding indebtedness of the Company s unconsolidated joint ventures at September 30, 2024, which matures in the subsequent 13-month period (i.e., through October 2025), consists of 61.4 million 30.6 million at SITE Centers share) for RVIP IIIB, which is expected to be extended in accordance with the loan documents. 
 No assurance can be provided that these obligations will be refinanced or repaid as currently anticipated. Any future deterioration in property-level revenues may cause the Company or one or more of its joint ventures to be unable to refinance maturing obligations or satisfy applicable covenants, financial tests or debt service requirements or loan maturity extension conditions in the future, thereby allowing the mortgage lender to assume control of property cash flows, limit distributions of cash to joint venture members, declare a default, increase the interest rate or accelerate the loan s maturity. In addition, rising interest rates or challenged transaction markets may adversely impact the ability of the Company or its joint ventures to sell assets at attractive prices in order to repay indebtedness. 
 Cash Flow Activity 
 The Company s cash flow activities are summarized as follows (in thousands):

(92,490) 

Changes in cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior comparable period, are as follows: 
 Operating Activities: Cash provided by operating activities decreased 48.9 million primarily due to lower rental income as a result of disposition activity partially offset by an increase in interest income. 
 Investing Activities: Cash provided by investing activities increased 1.9 billion primarily due to the following: 
 Increase in real estate assets acquired, developed and improved of 101.1 million; 

Increase in proceeds from disposition of real estate and joint ventures of 2.0 billion and 

Decrease in distributions from unconsolidated joint venture of 8.1 million. 

Financing Activities: Cash used for financing activities increased 1.4 billion primarily due to the following: 
 Increase in repayment of Senior Notes of 1.2 billion; 

Proceeds from draws on the Revolving Credit Facility in 2023 of 135.0 million; 

Increase in dividends paid in 2024 of 33.5 million due to a special dividend paid in January 2024; 

Proceeds from the termination of derivative contracts of 8.1 million; 

Payment of debt extinguishment costs of 8.1 million in 2024; 

Increase in debt issuance costs, commitment fees and Curbline loan costs of 24.6 million and 

Repurchases of common shares in 2023 of 26.6 million. 

Dividend Distribution 
 The Company declared common and preferred cash dividends of 63.1 million and 90.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In order to maximize the capitalization of Curbline and preserve funds for operations, the Company did not declare a dividend on its common shares with respect to the third quarter of 2024. 
 The Company intends to distribute at least 100 of ordinary taxable income in the form of common and preferred dividends (including the distribution of Curbline common shares) with respect to the year ending December 31, 2024 in order to maintain compliance with REIT requirements and in order to not incur federal income taxes (excluding federal income taxes applicable to its taxable REIT subsidiary activities). 
 30 

The Board of Directors of the Company intends to monitor the Company s dividend policy in order to maintain sufficient liquidity for operations and in order to maximize the Company s free cash flow while still adhering to REIT payout requirements and minimizing federal income taxes (excluding federal income taxes applicable to its taxable REIT subsidiary activities). The Company s future dividend policy may also be influenced by disposition activity, though the Company s ability to distribute sale proceeds to shareholders will be subject to restrictions set forth in the terms of the Company s indebtedness and prudent management of liquidity levels in connection with ongoing operations. 
 SITE Centers Equity 
 In 2022, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a common share repurchase program. Under the terms of the program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to a maximum value of 100.0 million of its common shares. Through September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased under this program 0.5 million of its common shares in open market transactions at an aggregate cost of 26.6 million. 
 In May 2024, the Company terminated its 250.0 million at the market continuous equity program. 
 Prior to the commencement of trading on August 19, 2024, in anticipation of the Curbline spin-off transaction, the Company effected a reverse stock split of its common shares, at a ratio of one-for-four. 
 SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL 
 The Company remains committed to maintaining sufficient liquidity, managing debt duration and maintaining prudent leverage levels in an effort to manage its overall risk profile while maintaining strategic flexibility. Debt financings, asset sales and cash flow from operations continue to represent potential sources of proceeds to be used to achieve these objectives. 
 Curbline Separation 
 On October 1, 2024, the Company completed the spin-off of Curbline. For additional information on the Curbline spin-off, see the Executive Summary Curbline Spin-Off section of this MD A. 
 Prior to the spin-off of Curbline, the Company used proceeds from the closing and funding of the Mortgage Facility and assets sales to redeem and/or repay all of the Company s outstanding unsecured indebtedness. As of October 1, 2024, the Company had completed the sale of substantially all of the properties that had been in its active disposition pipeline prior to the spin-off of Curbline. Going forward, the Company intends to realize value through operations and to consider various factors, including market conditions and differences between the public and private valuations of its portfolio, in evaluating whether and when to pursue additional asset sales. The timing of any additional sales may also be impacted by interim leasing, tactical redevelopment activities and other asset management initiatives intended to maximize value. The Company expects to use proceeds from any additional asset sales to repay outstanding indebtedness (including the Mortgage Facility) and make distributions to shareholders. Following the termination of the Company s Revolving Credit Facility in August 2024, the Company also plans to conservatively manage its cash position in order to ensure adequate resources to fund ongoing operations. 
 Acquisitions

 Joint Venture Dispositions 
 In May 2024, the Company acquired one asset owned by the DDRM Properties Joint Venture (Meadowmont Village, Chapel Hill, North Carolina) for 44.2 million 8.8 million at the Company s share). In June 2024, the DDRM Properties Joint Venture sold one asset (Hilltop Plaza, Richmond, California) for 36.5 million of which the Company s share was 7.3 million. There are no remaining assets in this joint venture. 
 Redevelopment Pipeline 
 The Company evaluates additional tactical redevelopment potential within the portfolio, particularly as it relates to the efficient use of the underlying real estate, which includes projects to expand, improve and re-tenant various properties. The Company generally expects to commence construction on redevelopment projects only after substantial tenant leasing has occurred. At September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 6 million in construction in progress in various active consolidated redevelopments and other projects. At September 30, 2024, the estimated cost to complete redevelopment projects at properties owned by Curbline pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement was approximately 33.7 million. 
 CAPITALIZATION 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company s capitalization consisted of 306.9 million of debt, 175.0 million of preferred shares and 3.2 billion of market equity (calculated as the common shares outstanding multiplied by 60.50, the closing price of the Company s common shares on the New York Stock Exchange at September 30, 2024, the last trading day of September 2024). 
 In July 2024, the Company announced a one-for-four reverse stock split of its common shares. Split-adjusted trading began on the New York Stock Exchange at the opening of trading on August 19, 2024. 
 On October 24, 2024, the Company announced that it intends to redeem all 175.0 million aggregate liquidation preference of its 6.375 Class A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the Class A Preferred Share at a redemption price of 500 per Class A Preferred Share (or 25.00 per depository share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends of 3.6302 per Class A Preferred Share (or 0.1815 per depositary share) on November 26, 2024. 
 Management seeks to maintain access to the capital resources necessary to manage the Company s balance sheet and to repay upcoming maturities. Accordingly, the Company may seek to obtain funds through additional debt or asset sales. In connection with the spin-off of Curbline, the Company used proceeds from the Mortgage Facility closing together with proceeds from asset sales to repay all of the Company s outstanding unsecured indebtedness and therefore no longer maintains a revolving line of credit or an investment grade rating. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all. 
 The Mortgage Facility contains certain operating and financial covenants, including, net worth and liquidity requirements, and includes provisions that could restrict the Company s access and use of rent collections from mortgaged properties in the event the debt yield falls below a certain threshold or an event of default occurs. Although the Company intends to operate in compliance with these covenants, if the Company were to violate these covenants, the Company may be subject to higher finance costs and fees or accelerated maturities. In addition, the Mortgage Facility permits the acceleration of maturity and foreclosure in the event of breaches of affirmative or negative covenants. Foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would have a negative impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS 
 The Company has addressed all of its consolidated debt maturing in 2024. The Company expects to fund repayment of future maturities from cash on hand, proceeds from asset sales and other investments, cash flow from operations and/or additional debt financings. No assurance can be provided that these obligations will be repaid as currently anticipated or refinanced. 
 34 

Other Guaranties 
 In conjunction with the redevelopment of shopping centers, the Company had entered into commitments with general contractors aggregating approximately 1.1 million for its consolidated properties at September 30, 2024, which includes the assets in the Company s redevelopment pipeline. These obligations, composed principally of construction contracts, are generally due within 12 to 24 months, as the related construction costs are incurred, and are expected to be financed through cash on hand, operating cash flows or asset sales. These contracts typically can be changed or terminated without penalty. 
 Additionally, the Separation and Distribution Agreement contains obligations to complete certain redevelopment projects at properties that are owned by Curbline. As of September 30, 2024, such redevelopment projects were estimated to cost 33.7 million to complete. 
 In connection with the sale of two properties in 2024 and two properties in 2023, the Company guaranteed additional construction costs to complete re-tenanting work at the properties and deferred maintenance, all of which were recorded as a liability. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a liability of approximately 12.3 million. The amount is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. 
 The Company routinely enters into contracts for the maintenance of its properties. These contracts typically can be canceled upon 30 to 60 days notice without penalty. At September 30, 2024, the Company had purchase order obligations, typically payable within one year, aggregating approximately 1.4 million related to the maintenance of its properties and general and administrative expenses. 
 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
 The Company continues to experience steady retailer demand which it believes is attributable to the concentration of the Company s portfolio in primarily suburban, high household income communities experiencing population growth, positive changes in remote and work-from-home trends, limited new construction of competing retail properties and tenants increasing use of physical store locations to improve the speed and efficiency of merchandise distribution. 
 The Company benefits from a diversified tenant base, with no tenant s annualized rental revenue equal to or exceeding 3 of the Company s annualized consolidated revenues plus the Company s proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture revenues. Other significant national tenants generally have relatively strong financial positions, have outperformed other retail categories over time and the Company believes remain well-capitalized. Historically these national tenants have provided a stable revenue base, and the Company believes that they will continue to provide a stable revenue base going forward, given the long-term nature of these leases. The majority of the tenants in the Company s shopping centers provide day-to-day consumer necessities with a focus on value and convenience, versus discretionary items, which the Company believes will enable many of its tenants to outperform under a variety of economic conditions. The Company has relatively little reliance on overage or percentage rents generated by tenant sales performance. 
 The Company believes that its shopping center portfolio is well positioned, as evidenced by its recent leasing activity, historical property income growth and consistent growth in average annualized base rent per occupied square foot. The Company executed new leases and renewals aggregating approximately 1.7 million square feet of space on a pro rata basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the shopping center portfolio occupancy, on a pro rata basis, was 91.1 and 92.0 , respectively, and the total portfolio average annualized base rent, on a pro rata basis, was 24.83 and 20.35, respectively. Historical occupancy has generally ranged from 89 to 94 over the last 10 years. The weighted-average cost of tenant improvements and lease commissions estimated to be incurred over the expected lease term for new leases executed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, on a pro rata basis, was 5.78 and 4.82 per rentable square foot, respectively. The Company generally does not expend a significant amount of capital on lease renewals. The comparability of period-over-period operating metrics has been increasingly impacted by the level and composition of the Company s disposition activities. 
 Inflation, higher interest rates and concerns over consumer spending, along with the volatility of global capital markets continue to pose risks to the U.S. economy, retail sales, and the Company s tenants. In addition to these macroeconomic challenges, the retail sector has been affected by changing consumer behaviors, including the competitive nature of the retail business and the competition for the share of the consumer wallet. The Company routinely monitors the credit profiles of its tenants and analyzes the possible impact of any potential tenant credit issues on the financial statements of the Company and its unconsolidated joint ventures. In some cases, changing conditions have resulted in weaker retailers and retail categories losing market share and declaring bankruptcy and/or closing stores. However, other retailers, specifically those in the value and convenience category, continue to launch new concepts and expand their store fleets within the suburban, high household income communities in which many of the Company s properties are located. As a result, the Company believes that its prospects to backfill vacant spaces or non-renewing tenants are generally good, though such re-tenanting efforts would likely require additional capital expenditures and the opportunities to lease any vacant theater 
 35 

spaces may be more limited. However, there can be no assurance that vacancy resulting from increasingly uncertain economic conditions will not adversely affect the Company s operating results (see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023). 
 Inflation, rising interest rates and the availability of commercial real estate financing have also impacted, at certain times, real estate owners ability to acquire and sell assets and raise equity and debt financing. Although the Company has no consolidated indebtedness maturing in 2024, debt capital markets could adversely impact the Company s ability to sell properties and its ability to refinance future maturities and the interest rates applicable thereto. 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 MD A should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the Company s consolidated financial statements, including trends that might appear, should not be taken as indicative of future operations. The Company considers portions of this information to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), both as amended, with respect to the Company s expectations for future periods. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements related to acquisitions (including any related pro forma financial information) and other business development activities, future capital expenditures, financing sources and availability and the effects of environmental and other regulations. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved. For this purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact should be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words will, believes, anticipates, plans, expects, seeks, estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Readers should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on forward-looking statements because such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond the Company s control and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements and that could materially affect the Company s actual results, performance or achievements. For additional factors that could cause the results of the Company to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 The Company is subject to general risks affecting the real estate industry, including the need to enter into new leases or renew leases on favorable terms to generate rental revenues, and any economic downturn may adversely affect the ability of the Company s tenants, or new tenants, to enter into new leases or the ability of the Company s existing tenants to renew their leases at rates at least as favorable as their current rates; 

The Company could be adversely affected by changes in the local markets where its properties are located, as well as by adverse changes in national economic and market conditions; 

The Company may fail to anticipate the effects on its properties of changes in consumer buying practices, including sales over the internet and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of its tenants, or a general downturn in its tenants businesses, which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent; 

The Company is subject to competition for tenants from other owners of retail properties, and its tenants are subject to competition from other retailers and methods of distribution. The Company is dependent upon the successful operations and financial condition of its tenants, in particular its major tenants, and could be adversely affected by the bankruptcy of those tenants; 

The Company leases the majority of its square footage to large tenants, which makes it vulnerable to changes in the business and financial condition of, or demand for its space by, such tenants; 

The Company may fail to dispose of properties on favorable terms, especially in regions experiencing deteriorating economic conditions. In addition, real estate investments can be illiquid, particularly as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties obtaining financing due to local or global conditions, and could limit the Company s ability to promptly make changes to its portfolio to respond to economic and other conditions; 

The Company may be subject to potential exposure to unexpected claims, liabilities or costs under the Company s agreements with Curbline and the Operating Partnership or otherwise in connection with the spin-off; 

36 

The Company may abandon a redevelopment opportunity after expending resources if it determines that the opportunity is not feasible due to a variety of factors, including a lack of availability of construction financing on reasonable terms, the impact of the economic environment on prospective tenants ability to enter into new leases or pay contractual rent, or the inability of the Company to obtain all necessary zoning and other required governmental permits and authorizations; 

The Company may not complete redevelopment projects on schedule as a result of various factors, many of which are beyond the Company s control, such as weather, labor conditions, governmental approvals, material shortages or general economic downturn, resulting in limited availability of capital, increased debt service expense and construction costs and decreases in revenue; 

The Company s financial condition may be affected by required debt service payments, the risk of default, restrictions on its ability to incur additional debt or to enter into certain transactions under its debt obligations. In addition, the Company may encounter difficulties in obtaining permanent financing or refinancing existing debt; 

Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market price of the Company s common shares, its ability to sell properties and prices realized, as well as its performance, interest expense levels and cash flow; 

Financing necessary for the Company to operate its business may not be available or may not be available on favorable terms; 

Disruptions in the financial markets could affect the Company s ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on the Company and the market price of the Company s common shares; 

Inflationary pressures could result in reductions in retailer profitability, consumer discretionary spending and tenant demand to lease space. Inflation could also increase the costs incurred by the Company to operate its properties and finance its operations and could adversely impact the valuation of its properties, all of which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company's common shares; 

The Company is subject to complex regulations related to its status as a REIT and would be adversely affected if it failed to qualify as a REIT; 

The Company must make distributions to shareholders to continue to qualify as a REIT, and if the Company must borrow funds to make distributions, those borrowings may not be available on favorable terms or at all; 

Joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made solely by the Company, including the possibility that a partner or co-venturer may become bankrupt, may at any time have interests or goals different from those of the Company and may take action contrary to the Company s instructions, requests, policies or objectives, including the Company s policy with respect to maintaining its qualification as a REIT. In addition, a partner or co venturer may not have access to sufficient capital to satisfy its funding obligations to the joint venture or may seek to terminate the joint venture, resulting in a loss to the Company of property revenues and management fees. The partner could cause a default under the joint venture loan for reasons outside the Company s control. Furthermore, the Company could be required to reduce the carrying value of its equity investments if a loss in the carrying value of the investment is realized; 

The Company s decision to dispose of real estate assets, including undeveloped land and construction in progress, would change the holding period assumption in the undiscounted cash flow impairment analyses, which could result in material impairment losses and adversely affect the Company s financial results; 

The outcome of pending or future litigation, including litigation with tenants or joint venture partners, may adversely affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition; 

Property damage, expenses related thereto, and other business and economic consequences (including the potential loss of revenue) resulting from extreme weather conditions or natural disasters in locations where the Company owns properties may adversely affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition; 

Sufficiency and timing of any insurance recovery payments related to damages and lost revenues from extreme weather conditions or natural disasters may adversely affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition; 

The Company and its tenants could be negatively affected by the impacts of pandemics and other public health crises; 

The Company is subject to potential environmental liabilities; 

37 

The Company may incur losses that are uninsured or exceed policy coverage due to its liability for certain injuries to persons, property or the environment occurring on its properties; 

The Company could be subject to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputation harm and other adverse effects on the Company s business due to stakeholders , including regulators , views regarding the Company's environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives, and the impact of factors outside of our control on such goals and initiatives; 

The Company could incur additional expenses to comply with or respond to claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act or otherwise be adversely affected by changes in government regulations, including changes in environmental, zoning, tax and other regulations; 

The Company s Board of Directors, which regularly reviews the Company s business strategy and objectives, may change the Company s strategic plan based on a variety of factors and conditions, including in response to changing market conditions and 

The Company and its vendors could sustain a disruption, failure or breach of their respective networks and systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, which could disrupt the Company s business operations, compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information and result in fines or penalties. 

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. At September 30, 2024, the Company s debt, excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt and excluding the impact of the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense related to the terminated interest rate swap, is summarized as follows:

The Company intends to use retained cash flow, proceeds from asset sales, and debt financing to repay indebtedness and fund capital expenditures at the Company s shopping centers. Thus, to the extent the Company incurs additional variable-rate indebtedness or needs to refinance existing fixed-rate indebtedness in a rising interest rate environment, its exposure to increases in interest rates in an inflationary period could increase. 
 Prior to the payoff of the Term Loan, the variable-rate (SOFR) component of the interest rate applicable to the Company s 200.0 million consolidated Term Loan was swapped to a fixed rate. 
 The carrying value of the Company s fixed-rate debt was adjusted to include the 200.0 million of variable-rate debt that was swapped to a fixed rate at December 31, 2023. An estimate of the effect of a 100 basis-point increase at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, is summarized as follows (in millions):

(B) Includes the fair value of the swap, which was an asset of 11.5 million at December 31, 2023. 

The sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the Company s fixed-rate debt was determined using a valuation model based upon factors that measure the net present value of such obligations that arise from the hypothetical estimate as discussed above. 
 The Company and its joint ventures intend to continually monitor and actively manage interest costs on their variable-rate debt portfolio and may enter into swap positions based on market fluctuations. In addition, the Company believes it has the ability to obtain funds through additional debt financing. Accordingly, the cost of obtaining such protection agreements versus the Company s access to capital markets will continue to be evaluated. The Company has not entered, and does not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no other material exposure to market risk.

 b) Dividends . 

i) The holders of Class A Shares of each series, in preference to the holders of Common Shares and of any other class of shares ranking junior to the Class A Shares, shall be entitled to receive out of any funds legally available therefor, and when and as declared by the Board of Directors, dividends in cash at the rate or rates for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 above and no more, payable on the dates fixed for such series.

c) Redemption . 

i) Subject to the express terms of each series, the Corporation: 

(1) May, from time to time at the option of the Board of Directors, redeem all or any part of any redeemable series of Class A Shares at the time outstanding at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item I; and 

(2) Shall, from time to time, make such redemptions of each series of Class A Shares as may be required to fulfill the requirements of any sinking fund provided for shares of such series at the applicable sinking fund redemption price fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item I; and shall in each case pay all accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date. 

ii) (1) Notice of every such redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the holders of record of the Class A Shares to be redeemed at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption, or such other time prior thereto as the Board of Directors shall fix for any series pursuant to Section 1 of this Item I prior to the issuance thereof.

In the event less than all of the outstanding Class A Shares are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall select by lot the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be prescribed by the Board of Directors. 

(2) If the holders of Class A Shares which have been called for redemption shall not within six years after such deposit claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust company 

shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the Corporation shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and to such holders. 

iii) Any Class A Shares which are (1) redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of this Section, (2) purchased and delivered in satisfaction of any sinking fund requirements provided for shares of such series, (3) converted in accordance with the express terms thereof, or (4) otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall resume the status of authorized but unissued Class A Shares without serial designation. 

iv) Except in connection with the exercise of the Corporation s rights pursuant to Section (d) of Item XIV of this Division A, Section 4(d) of Division B or any similar Section hereafter contained in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, with respect to any other class or series of capital stock hereafter created or authorized, the Corporation may not purchase or redeem (for sinking fund purposes or otherwise) less than all of the Class A Shares then outstanding except in accordance with a stock purchase offer made to all holders of record of Class A Shares, unless all dividends on all Class A Shares then outstanding for all previous and current dividend periods shall have been declared and paid or funds therefor set apart and all accrued sinking fund obligations applicable thereto shall have been complied with. 

d) Liquidation . 

i) (1) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Class A Shares of any series shall be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or distributed among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class A Shares, the amounts fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this Item I, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. In the event the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient to permit the payment upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares of the full preferential amount to which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed ratably upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares in proportion to the full preferential amount to which each such share is entitled. 

(2) After payment to the holders of Class A Shares of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, the holders of Class A Shares, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. 

ii) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other Corporation, the merger of any other Corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Section. 

e) Voting . 

i) The holders of Class A Shares shall have no voting rights, except as provided in this Section or required by law. 

ii) (1) If, and so often as, the Corporation shall be in default in the payment of dividends on any series of Class A Shares at the time outstanding, whether or not earned or declared, for a number of dividend payment periods, whether consecutive or not, which in the aggregate contain at least 540 days, all holders of such Class A Shares, voting separately as a class, together with all Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares and Noncumulative Shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable under the circumstances described in Subsection 5(c), shall be entitled to elect, as herein provided, a total of two members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that the holders of such Class A Shares shall not exercise such special class voting rights except at meetings of such shareholders for the election of directors at which the holders of not less than 50 of such Class A Shares are present in person or by proxy; and provided further that the special class voting rights provided for in this paragraph when the same shall have become vested shall remain so vested until all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Class A Shares then outstanding shall have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment, whereupon the holders of such Class A Shares shall be divested of their special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in the event above specified in this paragraph. 

(2) In the event of default entitling holders of Class A Shares to elect two directors as specified in paragraph (1) of this Subsection, a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing such 

directors shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called by, the holders of record of at least 10 of the Class A Shares upon which such default in the payment of dividends exists and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders shall be called to be held within 90 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Class A Shares. At any meeting at which such holders of Class A Shares shall be entitled to elect directors, holders of 50 of such Class A Shares, present in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the members of the Board of Directors which such holders of Class A Shares are entitled to elect as herein provided. Notwithstanding any provision of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Code of Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of directors of the Corporation, the two directors who may be elected by such holders of Class A Shares pursuant to this Subsection shall serve in addition to any other directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Nothing in this Subsection shall prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of or classifications of directors of the Corporation or require the resignation of any director elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Notwithstanding any classification of the other directors of the Corporation, the two directors elected by such holders of Class A Shares shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 

(3) Upon any divesting of the special class voting rights of the holders of the Class A Shares in respect of elections of directors as provided in this Subsection, the terms of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders shall terminate immediately thereupon. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders voting as a class may elect a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 

iii) If at any time when the holders of Class A Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section the holders of any Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares or Noncumulative Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant hereto by reason of any default in the payment of dividends thereon, then the voting rights of the Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares then entitled to vote shall be combined (with each class of shares having a number of votes proportional to the aggregate liquidation preference of its outstanding shares). In such case, the holders of Class A Shares and of all such other shares then entitled so to vote, voting as a class, shall elect such directors.

f) 6.375 Class A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares . Of the 750,000 authorized Class A Shares, 350,000 shares are designated as a series entitled 6.375 Class A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (hereinafter called 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares ).

2. with respect to shares issued any time after the aforesaid Dividend Record Date, dividends shall be cumulative from the Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, except that if such shares are issued during the period commencing the day after the Dividend Record Date for the payment of a dividend on the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares and ending on the Dividend Payment Date of that dividend, dividends with respect to such shares shall be cumulative from that Dividend Payment Date. 

Accrued but unpaid dividends on the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares shall not bear interest. Any dividend payment made on the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares which remains payable. All dividend payments made on the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares, at any time during which the Corporation is in default in the payment of dividends on such 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares for any dividend period, shall be deemed to be made in respect of the earliest dividend period with respect to which the Corporation is in default.

 If less than all of the outstanding 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be practicable without creating fractional shares) or by lot, such that, in each case, such selection will not result in the issuance of any 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit (as defined in Section (a) of Item XIV of this Division A of this Article Fourth ). 
 Notice of redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid, as of a date set by the Corporation not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, addressed to the respective holders of record of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares to be redeemed at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation. 
 1. No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares except as to the holder to whom such notice was defective or not given. 

2. A redemption notice which has been mailed in the manner provided herein shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date mailed whether or not the holder received the redemption notice.

If less than all of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice shall state the number of such 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed. 
 3. In the event the Corporation is exercising the Special Optional Redemption Right, the notice referred to above shall also state: (i) that the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares are being redeemed pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right in connection with the occurrence of a Change of Control and a brief description of the transaction(s) constituting such Change of Control; and (ii) that the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares to which such notice relates may not be tendered for conversion in connection with the Change of Control by the holder thereof and that each 6.375 Class A Preferred Share so tendered for conversion that is selected, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the related redemption date instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date. 

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding and except as otherwise required by law, the holders of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable with respect to their 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption thereof after such Dividend Record Date and on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date or the Corporation s default in the payment of the dividend due on 

such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided in this Section 6, the Corporation will make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares called for redemption.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares shall have the right, unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares pursuant to the Optional Redemption Right or Special Optional Redemption Right, to convert some or all of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares held by such holder (the Change of Control Conversion Right on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of Common Shares (or equivalent value of Alternative Conversion Consideration (as defined in this Section 6(e))) per 6.375 Class A Preferred Share to be converted (the Common Shares Conversion Consideration equal to the lesser of (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the sum of 500.00 per share plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid dividends will be included in this sum) by (2) the Common Share Price (as defined in clause (h) of this Section 6); and (ii) 111.60714 (the Share Cap ), subject to the adjustments described in the following paragraph. 
 Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding and except as otherwise required by law, the persons who are holders of record of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of those shares after such Dividend Record Date and on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date and, in such case, the full amount of such dividend shall be paid on such Dividend Payment Date to the persons who were the holders of record of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date. 
 The Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits (including those effected pursuant to a distribution of Common Shares), subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a Share Split with respect to Common Shares as follows: the adjusted Share Cap as the result of a Share Split will be the number of Common Shares that is equivalent to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such Share Split by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding after giving effect to such Share Split and the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to such Share Split. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the aggregate number of Common Shares (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) issuable in connection with the exercise of the Change of Control Conversion Right shall not exceed 39,062,520 Common Shares (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) (the Exchange Cap ). The Exchange Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Share Splits on the same basis as the corresponding adjustment to the Share Cap and is subject to increase in the event that additional 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares are designated and issued in the future pursuant to an amendment to these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation. 
 In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Shares will be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any combination thereof) (the Alternative Form Consideration ), a holder of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares will receive upon conversion of such 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares the kind and amount of Alternative Form Consideration that such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the Change of Control had such holder held a number of Common Shares equal to the Common Shares Conversion Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Change of Control (the Alternative Conversion Consideration the Common Shares Conversion Consideration or the Alternative Conversion Consideration, as may be applicable to a Change of Control, is referred to as the Conversion Consideration ). 
 If the holders of Common Shares have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Change of Control, the consideration that the holders of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares will 

receive will be in the form and proportion of the aggregate consideration elected by the holders of Common Shares who participate in the determination (based on the weighted average of elections) and will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Shares are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in the Change of Control. 
 No fractional Common Shares will be issued upon the conversion of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares. In lieu of fractional shares, holders shall be entitled to receive the cash value of such fractional shares based on the Common Share Price. 
 Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Corporation shall deliver a notice of occurrence of the Change of Control, describing the resulting Change of Control Conversion Right, to the holders of record of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation. 
 1. No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the conversion of any 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. 

2.

 In order to exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right, a holder of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares shall be required to deliver, on or before the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the certificates, if any, evidencing the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares to be converted, duly endorsed for transfer, together with a written conversion notice completed, to the Corporation s transfer agent.

Holders of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares may withdraw any notice of exercise of a Change of Control Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Corporation s transfer agent prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date. 

1.

2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares are held in global form, such notice of withdrawal must comply with applicable procedures of the Depositary. 

The 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares as to which the Change of Control Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not been properly withdrawn shall be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Conversion Right on the Change of Control Conversion Date, unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem such 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares, whether pursuant to the Optional Redemption Right or Special Optional Redemption Right. If the Corporation elects to redeem 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares that would otherwise be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control Conversion Date, such 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares shall not be so converted and the holders of such shares shall be entitled to receive on the applicable redemption date 500.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions on the ability to convert the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares, any conversion of the 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares in violation of the ownership limits described in Section (a) of Item XIV of this Division A of this Article Fourth and Section 4(a) of Division B of this Article Fourth, or that causes another person to be in violation of such ownership limits, including as a result of the effect of the operation of this provision, shall be construed as causing any 6.375 Class A Preferred Shares that exceed such ownership limits to be deemed Excess Preferred Shares and subject to the provisions applicable to Excess Preferred Shares set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation. 
 (vi) The amount payable per 6.375 Class A Preferred Share in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation shall be 500.00, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to, but not including, the date of payment.

(1) May, from time to time at the option of the Board of Directors, redeem all or any part of any redeemable series of Class B Shares at the time outstanding at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item II; and 

(2) Shall, from time to time, make such redemptions of each series of Class B Shares as may be required to fulfill the requirements of any sinking fund provided for shares of such series at the applicable sinking fund redemption price fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item II; and shall in each case pay all accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date. 

ii) (1) Notice of every such redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the holders of record of the Class B Shares to be redeemed at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption, or such other time prior thereto as the Board of Directors shall fix for any series pursuant to Section 1 of this Item II prior to the issuance thereof. At any time after notice as provided above has been deposited in the mail, the Corporation may deposit the aggregate redemption price of Class B Shares to be redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the redemption date, with any bank or trust company in Cleveland, Ohio, or New York, New York, having capital and surplus of not less than 100,000,000 named in such notice and direct that there be paid to the respective holders of the Class B Shares so to be redeemed amounts equal to the redemption price of the Class B Shares so to be redeemed, together with such accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, on surrender of the share certificate or certificates held by such holders; and upon the deposit of such notice in the mail and the making of such deposit of money with such bank or trust company, such holders shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares; and from and after the time such notice shall have been so deposited and such deposit of money shall have been so made, such holders shall have no rights or claim against the Corporation with respect to such shares, except only the right to receive such money from such bank or trust company without interest or to exercise before the redemption date any unexpired privileges of conversion. In the event less than all of the outstanding Class B Shares are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall select by lot the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be prescribed by the Board of Directors. 

(2) If the holders of Class B Shares which have been called for redemption shall not within six years after such deposit claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the Corporation shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and to such holders. 

iii) Any Class B Shares which are (1) redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of this Section, (2) purchased and delivered in satisfaction of any sinking fund requirements provided for shares of such series, (3) converted in accordance with the express terms thereof, or (4) otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall resume the status of authorized but unissued Class B Shares without serial designation. 

iv) Except in connection with the exercise of the Corporation s rights pursuant to Section (d) of Item XIV of this Division A, Section 4(d) of Division B or any similar Section hereafter contained in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, with respect to any other class or series of capital stock hereafter created or authorized, the Corporation may not purchase or redeem (for sinking fund purposes or otherwise) less than all of the Class B Shares then outstanding except in accordance with a stock purchase offer made to all holders of record of Class B Shares, unless all dividends on all Class B Shares then outstanding for all 

previous and current dividend periods shall have been declared and paid or funds therefor set apart and all accrued sinking fund obligations applicable thereto shall have been complied with. 

d) Liquidation . 

i) (1) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Class B Shares of any series shall be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or distributed among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class B Shares, the amounts fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this Item II, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. In the event the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient to permit the payment upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares of the full preferential amount to which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed ratably upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares in proportion to the full preferential amount to which each such share is entitled. 

(2) After payment to the holders of Class B Shares of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, the holders of Class B Shares, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. 

ii) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other Corporation, the merger of any other corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Section. 

e) Voting . 

i) The holders of Class B Shares shall have no voting rights, except as provided in this Section or required by law. 

ii) (1) If, and so often as, the Corporation shall be in default in the payment of dividends on any series of Class B Shares at the time outstanding, whether or not earned or declared, for a number of dividend payment periods, whether consecutive or not, which in the aggregate contain at least 540 days, all holders of Class B Shares, voting separately as a class, together with all Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares and Noncumulative Shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable under the circumstances described in Subsection 5(c), shall be entitled to elect, as herein provided, a total of two members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that the holders of such Class B Shares shall not exercise such special class voting rights except at meetings of such shareholders for the election of directors at which the holders of not less than 50 of such Class B Shares are present in person or by proxy; and provided further that the special class voting rights provided for in this paragraph when the same shall have become vested shall remain so vested until all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Class B Shares then outstanding shall have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient therefor set aside for payment, whereupon the holders of such Class B Shares shall be divested of their special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in the event above specified in this paragraph. 

(2) In the event of default entitling holders of Class B Shares to elect two directors as specified in paragraph (1) of this Subsection, a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing such directors shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called by, the holders of record of at least 10 of the Class B Shares upon which such default in the payment of dividends exists and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders shall be called to be held within 90 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Class B Shares. At any meeting at which such holders of Class B Shares shall be entitled to elect directors, holders of 50 of such Class B Shares, present in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the members of the Board of Directors which such holders of Class B Shares are entitled to elect as herein provided. Notwithstanding any provision of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Code of Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of directors of the Corporation, the two directors who may be elected by such holders of Class B Shares pursuant to this Subsection shall serve in addition to any other directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Nothing in this Subsection shall 

prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of or classifications of directors of the Corporation nor require the resignation of any director elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Notwithstanding any classification of the other directors of the Corporation, the two directors elected by such holders of Class B Shares shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 

(3) Upon any divesting of the special class voting rights of the holders of the Class B Shares in respect of elections of directors as provided in this Subsection, the terms of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders shall terminate immediately thereupon. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders voting as a class may elect a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 

iii) If at any time when the holders of Class B Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section the holders of any Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares or Noncumulative Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant hereto by reason of any default in the payment of dividends thereon, then the voting rights of the Cumulative Shares and the Noncumulative Shares then entitled to vote shall be combined (with class of shares having a number of votes proportional to the aggregate liquidation preference of its outstanding shares). In such case, the holders of Class B Shares and of all such other shares then entitled so to vote, voting as a class, shall elect such directors. If the holders of any such other shares have elected such directors prior to the happening of the default or event permitting the holders of Class B Shares to elect directors, or prior to a written request for the holding of a special meeting being received by the Secretary of the Corporation as required above, then a new election shall be held with all such other shares and the Class B Shares voting together as a single class for such directors, resulting in the termination of the term of such previously elected directors upon the election of such new directors. 

iv) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Class B Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to effect either of the following: 

(1) Any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class B Shares which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class B Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class B Shares nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class B Shares; or 

(2) The authorization, creation or increase in the authorized number of any shares, or any security convertible into shares, in either case ranking prior to such Class B Shares. 

(e) In the event, and only to the extent, that (1) Class B Shares are issued in more than one series and (2) Ohio law permits the holders of a series of a class of capital stock to vote separately as a class, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of each series of Class B Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such matters, shall be required for any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class B Shares or of any shares remaining on a parity with or junior to the Class B Shares nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series. 

III) The Class C Cumulative Preferred Shares. The Class C Shares shall have the following express terms:

The Board of Directors is authorized to adopt from time to time amendments to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, fixing, with respect to each such series, the matters described in clause s (a) through (i), inclusive, of this Section and is authorized to take such actions with respect thereto as may be required by law in order to effect such amendments. 
 b) Dividends . 

i) The holders of Class C Shares of each series, in preference to the holders of Common Shares and of any other class of shares ranking junior to the Class C Shares, shall be entitled to receive out of any funds legally available therefor, and when and as declared by the Board of Directors, dividends in cash at the rate or rates for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 above and no more, payable on the dates fixed for such series. Such dividends shall accrue and be cumulative, in the case of shares of each particular series, from and after the date or dates fixed with respect to such series.

c) Redemption . 

i) Subject to the express terms of each series, the Corporation: 

(1) May, from time to time at the option of the Board of Directors, redeem all or any part of any redeemable series of Class C Shares at the time outstanding at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item III; and 

(2) Shall, from time to time, make such redemptions of each series of Class C Shares as may be required to fulfill the requirements of any sinking fund provided for shares of such series at the applicable sinking fund redemption price fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item III; and shall in each case pay all accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.

In the event less than all of the outstanding Class C Shares are to be 

redeemed, the Corporation shall select by lot the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be prescribed by the Board of Directors. 

(2) If the holders of Class C Shares which have been called for redemption shall not within six years after such deposit claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the Corporation shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and to such holders.

d) Liquidation . 

i) (1) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Class C Shares of any series shall be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or distributed among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class C Shares, the amounts fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this Item III, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. In the event the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient to permit the payment upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares of the full preferential amount to which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed ratably upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares in proportion to the full preferential amount to which each such share is entitled. 

(2) After payment to the holders of Class C Shares of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, the holders of Class C Shares, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. 

ii) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other Corporation, the merger of any other Corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Section.

i) The holders of Class C Shares shall have no voting rights, except as provided in this Section or required by law.

such Class C Shares shall be divested of their special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in the event above specified in this paragraph. All dividend payments made on the Class C Shares, at any time during which the Corporation is in default in the payment of dividends on such Class C Shares for any dividend period, shall be deemed to be made in respect of the earliest dividend period with respect to which the Corporation is in default. 

(2) In the event of default entitling holders of Class C Shares to elect two directors as specified in paragraph (1) of this Subsection, a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing such directors shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called by, the holders of record of at least 10 of the Class C Shares upon which such default in the payment of dividends exists and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders shall be called to be held within 90 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Class C Shares. At any meeting at which such holders of Class C Shares shall be entitled to elect directors, holders of 50 of such Class C Shares, present in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the members of the Board of Directors which such holders of Class C Shares are entitled to elect as herein provided. Notwithstanding any provision of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Code of Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of directors of the Corporation, the two directors who may be elected by such holders of Class C Shares pursuant to this Subsection shall serve in addition to any other directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Nothing in this Subsection shall prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of or classifications of directors of the Corporation or require the resignation of any director elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Notwithstanding any classification of the other directors of the Corporation, the two directors elected by such holders of Class C Shares shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 

(3) Upon any divesting of the special class voting rights of the holders of the Class C Shares in respect of elections of directors as provided in this Subsection, the terms of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders shall terminate immediately thereupon. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders voting as a class may elect a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 

iii) If at any time when the holders of Class C Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section the holders of any Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares or Noncumulative Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant hereto by reason of any default in the payment of dividends thereon, then the voting rights of the Cumulative Shares and the Noncumulative Shares then entitled to vote shall be combined (with each class of shares having a number of votes proportional to the aggregate liquidation preference of its outstanding shares). In such case, the holders of Class C Shares and of all such other shares then entitled so to vote, voting as a class, shall elect such directors. If the holders of any such other shares have elected such directors prior to the happening of the default or event permitting the holders of Class C Shares to elect directors, or prior to a written request for the holding of a special meeting being received by the Secretary of the Corporation as required above, then a new election shall be held with all such other shares and the Class C Shares voting together as a single class for such directors, resulting in the termination of the term of such previously elected directors upon the election of such new directors. 

iv) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Class C Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to effect either of the following: 

(1) Any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class C Shares which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class C Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class C Shares nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class C Shares; or 

(2) The authorization, creation or increase in the authorized number of any shares, or any security convertible into shares, in either case ranking prior to such series of Class C Shares. 

v) In the event, and only to the extent, that (1) Class C Shares are issued in more than one series and (2) Ohio law permits the holders of a series of a class of capital stock to vote separately as a class, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of each series of Class C Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such matters, shall be required for any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class C Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class C Shares nor the Amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series. 

IV) The Class D Cumulative Preferred Shares. The Class D Shares shall have the following express terms:

All Class D Shares shall be of equal rank and shall be identical, except in respect of the matters that may be fixed by the Board of Directors as hereinafter provided, and each share of a series shall be identical with all other shares of such series, except as to the dates from which dividends shall accrue and be cumulative. All Class D Shares shall rank on a parity with the Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares and Noncumulative Shares and shall be identical to all Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares and Noncumulative Shares except (1) in respect of the matters that may be fixed by the Board of Directors as provided in clause s (a) through (i), inclusive, of this Section 1 and (2) only dividends on Cumulative Shares shall be cumulative as set forth herein.

c) Redemption . 

i) Subject to the express terms of each series, the Corporation: 

(1) May, from time to time at the option of the Board of Directors, redeem all or any part of any redeemable series of Class D Shares at the time outstanding at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item IV; and 

(2) Shall, from time to time, make such redemptions of each series of Class D Shares as may be required to fulfill the requirements of any sinking fund provided for shares of such series at the applicable sinking fund redemption price fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item IV; and shall in each case pay all accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.

(2) If the holders of Class D Shares which have been called for redemption shall not within six years after such deposit claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the Corporation shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and to such holders. 

iii) Any Class D Shares which are (1) redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of this Section, (2) purchased and delivered in satisfaction of any sinking fund requirements provided for shares of such series, (3) converted in accordance with the express terms thereof, or (4) otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall resume the status of authorized but unissued Class D Shares without serial designation.

d) Liquidation . 

i) (1) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Class D Shares of any series shall be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or distributed among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class D Shares, the amounts fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this Item IV, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. In the event the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient to permit the payment upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares of the full preferential amount to which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed ratably upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares in proportion to the full preferential amount to which each such share is entitled. 

(2) After payment to the holders of Class D Shares of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, the holders of Class D Shares, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. 

ii) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other Corporation, the merger of any other Corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Section. 

e) Voting . 

i) The holders of Class D Shares shall have no voting rights, except as provided in this Section or required by law. 

ii) (1) If, and so often as, the Corporation shall be in default in the payment of dividends on any series of Class D Shares at the time outstanding, whether or not earned or declared, for a number of dividend payment periods, whether consecutive or not, which in the aggregate contain at least 540 days, all holders of such Class D Shares, voting separately as a class, together with all Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares and Noncumulative Shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable under the circumstances described in Subsection 5(c), shall be entitled to elect, as herein provided, a total of two members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that the holders of such Class D Shares shall not exercise such special class voting rights except at meetings of such shareholders for the election of directors at which the holders of not less than 50 of such Class D Shares are present in person or by proxy; and provided further that the special class voting rights provided for in this paragraph when the same shall have become vested shall remain so vested until all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Class D Shares then outstanding shall have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment, whereupon the holders of such Class D Shares shall be divested of their special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in the event above specified in this paragraph. All dividend payments made on the Class D Shares, at any time during which the Corporation is in default in the payment of dividends on such Class D Shares for any dividend period, shall be deemed to be made in respect of the earliest dividend period with respect to which the Corporation is in default. 

(2) In the event of default entitling holders of Class D Shares to elect two directors as specified in paragraph (1) of this Subsection, a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing such directors shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called by, the holders of record of at least 10 of the Class D Shares upon which such default in the payment of dividends exists and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders shall be called to be held within 90 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Class D Shares. At any meeting at which such holders of Class D Shares shall be entitled to elect directors, holders of 50 of such Class D Shares, present in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the members of the Board of Directors which such holders of Class D Shares are entitled to elect as herein provided. Notwithstanding any provision of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Code of Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of directors of the Corporation, the two directors who may be elected by such holders of Class D Shares pursuant to this Subsection shall serve in addition to any other directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Nothing in this Subsection shall prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of or classifications of directors of the Corporation or require the resignation of any director elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Notwithstanding any classification of the other directors of the Corporation, the two directors elected by such holders of Class D Shares shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 

(3) Upon any divesting of the special class voting rights of the holders of the Class D Shares in respect of elections of directors as provided in this Subsection, the terms of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders shall terminate immediately thereupon. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders voting as a class may elect a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 

iii) If at any time when the holders of Class D Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section the holders of any Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class E 

Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares or Noncumulative Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant hereto by reason of any default in the payment of dividends thereon, then the voting rights of the Cumulative Shares and the Noncumulative Shares then entitled to vote shall be combined (with each class of shares having a number of votes proportional to the aggregate liquidation preference of its outstanding shares). In such case, the holders of Class D Shares and of all such other shares then entitled so to vote, voting as a class, shall elect such directors. If the holders of any such other shares have elected such directors prior to the happening of the default or event permitting the holders of Class D Shares to elect directors, or prior to a written request for the holding of a special meeting being received by the Secretary of the Corporation as required above, then a new election shall be held with all such other shares and the Class D Shares voting together as a single class for such directors, resulting in the termination of the term of such previously elected directors upon the election of such new directors. 

iv) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Class D Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to effect either of the following: 

(1) Any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class D Shares which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class D Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class D Shares nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class D Shares; or 

(2) The authorization, creation or increase in the authorized number of any shares, or any security convertible into shares, in either case ranking prior to such series of Class D Shares. 

(e) In the event, and only to the extent, that (1) Class D Shares are issued in more than one series and (2) Ohio law permits the holders of a series of a class of capital stock to vote separately as a class, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of each series of Class D Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such matters, shall be required for any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class D Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class D Shares nor the Amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series.

Notwithstanding any provision of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Code of Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of directors of the Corporation, the two directors who may be elected by such holders of Class E Shares pursuant to this Subsection shall serve in addition to any other directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Nothing in this Subsection shall prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of or classifications of directors of the Corporation or require the resignation of any director elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Notwithstanding any classification of the other directors of the Corporation, the two directors elected by such holders of Class E Shares shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 

(3) Upon any divesting of the special class voting rights of the holders of the Class E Shares in respect of elections of directors as provided in this Subsection, the terms of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders shall terminate immediately thereupon. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders voting as a class may elect a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 

iii) If at any time when the holders of Class E Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section the holders of any Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares or Noncumulative Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant hereto by reason of any default in the payment of dividends thereon, then the voting rights of the Cumulative Shares and the Noncumulative Shares then entitled to vote shall be combined (with each class of shares having a number of votes proportional to the aggregate liquidation preference of its outstanding shares). In such case, the holders of Class E Shares and of all such other shares then entitled so to vote, voting as a class, shall elect such directors. If the holders of any such other shares have elected such directors prior to the happening of the default or event permitting the holders of Class E Shares to elect directors, or prior to a written request for the holding of a special meeting being received by the Secretary of the Corporation as required above, then a new election shall be held with all such other shares and the Class E Shares voting together as a single class for such directors, resulting in the termination of the term of such previously elected directors upon the election of such new directors. 

iv) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Class E Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to effect either of the following: 

(1) Any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class E Shares which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class E Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class E Shares nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class E Shares; or 

(2) The authorization, creation or increase in the authorized number of any shares, or any security convertible into shares, in either case ranking prior to such series of Class E Shares. 

(e) In the event, and only to the extent, that (1) Class E Shares are issued in more than one series and (2) Ohio law permits the holders of a series of a class of capital stock to vote separately as a class, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of each series of Class E Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such matters, shall be required for any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class E Shares or of any shares ranking on a 

parity with or junior to the Class E Shares nor the Amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series. 

VI) The Class F Cumulative Preferred Shares. The Class F Shares shall have the following express terms:

 b) Dividends . 

i) The holders of Class F Shares of each series, in preference to the holders of Common Shares and of any other class of shares ranking junior to the Class F Shares, shall be entitled to receive out of any funds legally available therefor, and when and as declared by the Board of Directors, dividends in cash at the rate or rates for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 above and no more, payable on the dates fixed for such series. Such dividends shall accrue and be cumulative, in the case of shares of each particular series, from and after the date or dates fixed with respect to such series.

c) Redemption . 

i) Subject to the express terms of each series, the Corporation: 

(1) May, from time to time at the option of the Board of Directors, redeem all or any part of any redeemable series of Class F Shares at the time outstanding at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item VI; and 

(2) Shall, from time to time, make such redemptions of each series of Class F Shares as may be required to fulfill the requirements of any sinking fund provided for shares of such series at the applicable sinking fund redemption price fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item VI; and shall in each case pay all accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date. 

ii) (1) Notice of every such redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the holders of record of the Class F Shares to be redeemed at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption, or such other time prior thereto as the Board of Directors shall fix for any series pursuant to Section 1 of this Item VI prior to the issuance thereof. At any time after notice as provided above has been deposited in the mail, the Corporation may deposit the aggregate redemption price of Class F Shares to be redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the redemption date, with any bank or trust company in Cleveland, Ohio, or New York, New York, having capital

In the event less than all of the outstanding Class F Shares are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall select by lot the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be prescribed by the Board of Directors. 

(2) If the holders of Class F Shares which have been called for redemption shall not within six years after such deposit claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the Corporation shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and to such holders. 

iii) Any Class F Shares which are (1) redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of this Section, 

(1) purchased and delivered in satisfaction of any sinking fund requirements provided for shares of such series, 

(2) converted in accordance with the express terms thereof, or (4) otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall resume the status of authorized but unissued Class F Shares without serial designation.

d) Liquidation . 

i) (1) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Class F Shares of any series shall be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or distributed among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class F Shares, the amounts fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this Item VI, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. In the event the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient to permit the payment upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares of the full preferential amount to which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed ratably upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares in proportion to the full preferential amount to which each such share is entitled. 

(2) After payment to the holders of Class F Shares of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, the holders of Class F Shares, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. 

ii) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other Corporation, the merger of any other Corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Section. 

e) Voting . 

i) The holders of Class F Shares shall have no voting rights, except as provided in this Section or required by law. 

ii) (1) If, and so often as, the Corporation shall be in default in the payment of dividends on any series of Class F Shares at the time outstanding, whether or not earned or declared, for a number of dividend payment periods, whether consecutive or not, which in the aggregate contain at least 540 days, all holders of such Class F Shares, voting separately as a class, together with all Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares and Noncumulative Shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable under the circumstances described in Subsection 5(c), shall be entitled to elect, as herein provided, a total of two members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that the holders of such Class F Shares shall not exercise such special class voting rights except at meetings of such shareholders for the election of directors at which the holders of not less than 50 of such Class F Shares are present in person or by proxy; and provided further that the special class voting rights provided for in this paragraph when the same shall have become vested shall remain so vested until all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Class F Shares then outstanding shall have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment, whereupon the holders of such Class F Shares shall be divested of their special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in the event above specified in this paragraph. All dividend payments made on the Class F Shares, at any time during which the Corporation is in default in the payment of dividends on such Class F Shares for any dividend period, shall be deemed to be made in respect of the earliest dividend period with respect to which the Corporation is in default. 

(2) In the event of default entitling holders of Class F Shares to elect two directors as specified in paragraph (1) of this Subsection, a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing such directors shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called by, the holders of record of at least 10 of the Class F Shares upon which such default in the payment of dividends exists and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders shall be called to be held within 90 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Class F Shares. At any meeting at which such holders of Class F Shares shall be entitled to elect directors, holders of 50 of such Class F Shares, present in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the members of the Board of Directors which such holders of Class F Shares are entitled to elect as herein provided. Notwithstanding any provision of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Code of Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of directors of the Corporation, the two directors who may be elected by such holders of Class F Shares pursuant to this Subsection shall serve in addition to any other directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Nothing in this Subsection shall prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of or classifications of directors of the Corporation or require the resignation of any director elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Notwithstanding any classification of the other directors of the Corporation, the two directors elected by such holders of Class F Shares shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 

(3) Upon any divesting of the special class voting rights of the holders of the Class F Shares in respect of elections of directors as provided in this Subsection, the terms of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders shall terminate immediately thereupon. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders voting as a class may elect a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 

iii) If at any time when the holders of Class F Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section the holders of any Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares or Noncumulative Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant hereto by reason of any default in the payment of dividends thereon, then the voting rights of the Cumulative Shares and the Noncumulative Shares then entitled to vote shall be combined (with each class of shares having a number of votes proportional to the aggregate liquidation preference of its outstanding shares). In such case, the holders of Class F Shares and of all such other shares then entitled so to vote, voting as a class, shall elect such directors. I f the holders of any such other shares have elected such directors prior to the happening of the default or event permitting the holders of Class F Shares to elect directors, or prior to a written request for the holding of a special meeting being received by the Secretary of the Corporation as required above, then a new election shall be held with all such other shares and the Class F Shares voting together as a single class for such directors, resulting in the termination of the term of such previously elected directors upon the election of such new directors. 

iv) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Class F Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to effect either of the following: 

(1) Any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class F Shares which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class F Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class F Shares nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class F Shares; or 

(2) The authorization, creation or increase in the authorized number of any shares, or any security convertible into shares, in either case ranking prior to such series of Class F Shares. 

(e) In the event, and only to the extent, that (1) Class F Shares are issued in more than one series and (2) Ohio law permits the holders of a series of a class of capital stock to vote separately as a class, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of each series of Class F Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such matters, shall be required for any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class F Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class F Shares nor the Amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series.

At any time after notice as provided above has been deposited in the mail, the Corporation may deposit the aggregate redemption price of Class G Shares to be redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the redemption date, with any bank or trust company in Cleveland, Ohio, or New York, New York, having capital and surplus of not less than 100,000,000 named in such notice and direct that there be paid to the respective holders of the Class G Shares so to be redeemed amounts equal to the redemption price of the Class G Shares so to be redeemed, together with such accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, on surrender of the share certificate or certificates held by such holders; and upon the deposit of such notice in the mail and the making of such deposit of money with such bank or trust company, such holders shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares; and from and after the time such notice shall have been so deposited and such deposit of money shall have been so made, such holders shall have no rights or claim against the Corporation with respect to such shares, except only the right to receive such money from such bank or trust company without interest or to exercise before the redemption date any unexpired privileges of conversion. In the event less than all of the outstanding Class G Shares are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall select by lot the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be prescribed by the Board of Directors. 

(2) If the holders of Class G Shares which have been called for redemption shall not within six years after such deposit claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the Corporation shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and to such holders. 

iii) Any Class G Shares which are (1) redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of this Section, (2) purchased and delivered in satisfaction of any sinking fund requirements provided for shares of such series, (3) converted in accordance with the express terms thereof, or (4) otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall resume the status of authorized but unissued Class G Shares without serial designation. 

iv) Except in connection with the exercise of the Corporation s rights pursuant to Section (d) of Item XIV of this Division A, Section 4(d) of Division B or any similar Section hereafter contained in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, with respect to any other class or series of capital stock hereafter created or authorized, the Corporation may not purchase or redeem (for sinking fund purposes or otherwise) less than all of the Class G Shares then outstanding except in accordance with a stock purchase offer made to all holders of record of Class G Shares, unless all dividends on all Class G Shares then outstanding for all previous and current dividend periods shall have been declared and paid or funds therefor set apart and all accrued sinking fund obligations applicable thereto shall have been complied with. 

d) Liquidation . 

i) (1) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Class G Shares of any series shall be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or distributed among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class G Shares, the amounts fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this Item VII, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. In the event the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient to permit the payment upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares of the full preferential amount to which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed ratably upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares in proportion to the full preferential amount to which each such share is entitled. 

(2) After payment to the holders of Class G Shares of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, the holders of Class G Shares, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. 

ii) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other Corporation, the merger of any other Corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Section. 

e) Voting . 

i) The holders of Class G Shares shall have no voting rights, except as provided in this Section or required by law. 

ii) (1)	If, and so often as, the Corporation shall be in default in the payment of dividends on any series of Class G Shares at the time outstanding, whether or not earned or declared, for a number of dividend payment periods, whether consecutive or not, which in the aggregate contain at least 540 days, all holders of such Class G Shares, voting separately as a class, together with all Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares and Noncumulative Shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable under the circumstances described in Subsection 5(c), shall be entitled to elect, as herein provided, a total of two members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that the holders of such Class G Shares shall not exercise such special class voting rights except at meetings of such shareholders for the election of directors at which the holders of not less than 50 of such Class G Shares are present in person or by proxy; and provided further that the special class voting rights provided for in this paragraph when the same shall have become vested shall remain so vested until all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Class G Shares then outstanding shall have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment, whereupon the holders of such Class G Shares shall be divested of their special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in the event above specified in this paragraph. All dividend payments made on the Class G Shares, at any time during which the Corporation is in default in the payment of dividends on such Class G Shares for any dividend period, shall be deemed to be made in respect of the earliest dividend period with respect to which the Corporation is in default. 

(2) In the event of default entitling holders of Class G Shares to elect two directors as specified in paragraph (1) of this Subsection, a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing such directors shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called by, the holders of record of at least 10 of the Class G Shares upon which such default in the payment of dividends exists and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders shall be called to be held within 90 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Class G Shares. At any meeting at which such holders of Class G Shares shall be entitled to elect directors, holders of 50 of such Class G Shares, present in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the members of the Board of Directors which such holders of Class G Shares are entitled to elect as herein provided. Notwithstanding any provision of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Code of Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of directors of the Corporation, the two directors who may be elected by such holders of Class G Shares pursuant to this Subsection shall serve in addition to any other directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Nothing in this Subsection shall prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of or classifications of directors of the Corporation or require the resignation of any director elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Notwithstanding any 

classification of the other directors of the Corporation, the two directors elected by such holders of Class G Shares shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 

(3) Upon any divesting of the special class voting rights of the holders of the Class G Shares in respect of elections of directors as provided in this Subsection, the terms of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders shall terminate immediately thereupon. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders voting as a class may elect a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 

iii) If at any time when the holders of Class G Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section the holders of any Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares or Noncumulative Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant hereto by reason of any default in the payment of dividends thereon, then the voting rights of the Cumulative Shares and the Noncumulative Shares then entitled to vote shall be combined (with each class of shares having a number of votes proportional to the aggregate liquidation preference of its outstanding shares). In such case, the holders of Class G Shares and of all such other shares then entitled so to vote, voting as a class, shall elect such directors. If the holders of any such other shares have elected such directors prior to the happening of the default or event permitting the holders of Class G Shares to elect directors, or prior to a written request for the holding of a special meeting being received by the Secretary of the Corporation as required above, then a new election shall be held with all such other shares and the Class G Shares voting together as a single class for such directors, resulting in the termination of the term of such previously elected directors upon the election of such new directors. 

iv) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Class G Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to effect either of the following: 

(1) Any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class G Shares which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class G Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class G Shares nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class G Shares; or 

(2) The authorization, creation or increase in the authorized number of any shares, or any security convertible into shares, in either case ranking prior to such series of Class G Shares. 

(e) In the event, and only to the extent, that (1) Class G Shares are issued in more than one series and (2) Ohio law permits the holders of a series of a class of capital stock to vote separately as a class, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of each series of Class G Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such matters, shall be required for any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class G Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class G Shares nor the Amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series. 

VIII) The Class H Cumulative Preferred Shares. The Class H Shares shall have the following express terms:

ix) Restrictions (in addition to those set forth in Subsection 5(d) or 5(e) of this Item VIII) on the issuance of shares of the same series or of any other class or series. 

The Board of Directors is authorized to adopt from time to time amendments to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, fixing, with respect to each such series, the matters described in clause s (a) through (i), inclusive, of this Section and is authorized to take such actions with respect thereto as may be required by law in order to effect such amendments. 
 b) Dividends . 

i) The holders of Class H Shares of each series, in preference to the holders of Common Shares and of any other class of shares ranking junior to the Class H Shares, shall be entitled to receive out of any funds legally available therefor, and when and as declared by the Board of Directors, dividends in cash at the rate or rates for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 above and no more, payable on the dates fixed for such series. Such dividends shall accrue and be cumulative, in the case of shares of each particular series, from and after the date or dates fixed with respect to such series. No dividends shall be paid upon or declared or set apart for any series of the Class H Shares for any dividend period unless at the same time (i) a like proportionate dividend for the dividend periods terminating on the same or any earlier date, ratably in proportion to the respective annual dividend rates fixed therefor, shall have been paid upon or declared or set apart for all Class H Shares of all series then issued and outstanding and entitled to receive such dividend and (ii) the dividends payable for the dividend periods terminating on the same or any earlier date (but, with respect to Noncumulative Shares, only with respect to the then current dividend period), ratably in proportion to the respective dividend rates fixed therefor, shall have been paid upon or declared or set apart for all Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares and Noncumulative Shares then issued and outstanding and entitled to receive such dividends.

or otherwise acquired by the Corporation, except out of the proceeds of the sale of Common Shares or other shares of the Corporation ranking junior to the Class H Shares received by the Corporation subsequent to the date of first issuance of Class H Shares of any series, unless: 

(1) All accrued and unpaid dividends on Cumulative Shares, including the full dividends for all current dividend periods, shall have been declared and paid or a sum sufficient for payment thereof set apart;

c) Redemption . 

i) Subject to the express terms of each series, the Corporation: 

(1) May, from time to time at the option of the Board of Directors, redeem all or any part of any redeemable series of Class H Shares at the time outstanding at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item VIII; and 

(2) Shall, from time to time, make such redemptions of each series of Class H Shares as may be required to fulfill the requirements of any sinking fund provided for shares of such series at the applicable sinking fund redemption price fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item VIII; and shall in each case pay all accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date. 

ii) (1) Notice of every such redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the holders of record of the Class H Shares to be redeemed at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption, or such other time prior thereto as the Board of Directors shall fix for any series pursuant to Section 1 of this Item VIII prior to the issuance thereof.

In the event less than all of the outstanding Class H Shares are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall select by lot the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be prescribed by the Board of Directors. 

(2) If the holders of Class H Shares which have been called for redemption shall not within six years after such deposit claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the Corporation shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and to such holders. 

iii) Any Class H Shares which are (1) redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of this Section, (2) purchased and delivered in satisfaction of any sinking fund requirements provided for shares of such series, (3) converted in accordance with the express terms thereof, or (4) otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall resume the status of authorized but unissued Class H Shares without serial designation.

d) Liquidation . 

i) (1) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Class H Shares of any series shall be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or distributed among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class H Shares, the amounts fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this Item VIII, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. In the event the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient to permit the payment upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares of the full preferential amount to which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed ratably upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares in proportion to the full preferential amount to which each such share is entitled. 

(2) After payment to the holders of Class H Shares of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, the holders of Class H Shares, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. 

ii) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other Corporation, the merger of any other Corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Section. 

e) Voting . 

i) The holders of Class H Shares shall have no voting rights, except as provided in this Section or required by law. 

ii) (1) If, and so often as, the Corporation shall be in default in the payment of dividends on any series of Class H Shares at the time outstanding, whether or not earned or declared, for a number of dividend payment periods, whether consecutive or not, which in the aggregate contain at least 540 days, all holders of such Class H Shares, voting separately as a class, together with all Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares and Noncumulative Shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable under the circumstances described in Subsection 5(c), shall be entitled to elect, as herein provided, a total of two members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that the holders of such Class H Shares shall not exercise such special class voting rights except at meetings of such shareholders for the election of directors at which the holders of not less than 50 of such Class H Shares are present in person or by proxy; and provided further that the special class voting rights provided for in this paragraph when the same shall have become vested shall remain so vested until all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Class H Shares then outstanding shall have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment, whereupon the holders of such Class H Shares shall be divested of their special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in the event above specified in this paragraph. All dividend payments made on the Class H Shares, at any time during which the Corporation is in 

default in the payment of dividends on such Class H Shares for any dividend period, shall be deemed to be made in respect of the earliest dividend period with respect to which the Corporation is in default. 

(2) In the event of default entitling holders of Class H Shares to elect two directors as specified in paragraph (1) of this Subsection, a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing such directors shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called by, the holders of record of at least 10 of the Class H Shares upon which such default in the payment of dividends exists and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders shall be called to be held within 90 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Class H Shares. At any meeting at which such holders of Class H Shares shall be entitled to elect directors, holders of 50 of such Class H Shares, present in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the members of the Board of Directors which such holders of Class H Shares are entitled to elect as herein provided. Notwithstanding any provision of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Code of Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of directors of the Corporation, the two directors who may be elected by such holders of Class H Shares pursuant to this Subsection shall serve in addition to any other directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Nothing in this Subsection shall prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of or classifications of directors of the Corporation or require the resignation of any director elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Notwithstanding any classification of the other directors of the Corporation, the two directors elected by such holders of Class H Shares shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 

(3) Upon any divesting of the special class voting rights of the holders of the Class H Shares in respect of elections of directors as provided in this Subsection, the terms of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders shall terminate immediately thereupon. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders voting as a class may elect a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 

iii) If at any time when the holders of Class H Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section the holders of any Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares or Noncumulative Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant hereto by reason of any default in the payment of dividends thereon, then the voting rights of the Cumulative Shares and the Noncumulative Shares then entitled to vote shall be combined (with each class of shares having a number of votes proportional to the aggregate liquidation preference of its outstanding shares). In such case, the holders of Class H Shares and of all such other shares then entitled so to vote, voting as a class, shall elect such directors. If the holders of any such other shares have elected such directors prior to the happening of the default or event permitting the holders of Class H Shares to elect directors, or prior to a written request for the holding of a special meeting being received by the Secretary of the Corporation as required above, then a new election shall be held with all such other shares and the Class H Shares voting together as a single class for such directors, resulting in the termination of the term of such previously elected directors upon the election of such new directors. 

iv) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Class H Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to effect either of the following: 

(1) Any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class H Shares which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class H Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class H Shares nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class H Shares; or 

(2) The authorization, creation or increase in the authorized number of any shares, or any security convertible into shares, in either case ranking prior to such series of Class H Shares. 

(e) In the event, and only to the extent, that (1) Class H Shares are issued in more than one series and (2) Ohio law permits the holders of a series of a class of capital stock to vote separately as a class, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of each series of Class H Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such matters, shall be required for any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class H Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class H Shares nor the Amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series. 

IX) The Class I Cumulative Preferred Shares. The Class I Shares shall have the following express terms: 

a) Series . The Class I Shares may be issued from time to time in one or more series. All Class I Shares shall be of equal rank and shall be identical, except in respect of the matters that may be fixed by the Board of Directors as hereinafter provided, and each share of a series shall be identical with all other shares of such series, except as to the dates from which dividends shall accrue and be cumulative. All Class I Shares shall rank on a parity with the Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares and Noncumulative Shares and shall be identical to all Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares and Noncumulative Shares except (1) in respect of the matters that may be fixed by the Board of Directors as provided in clause s (a) through (i), inclusive, of this Section and (2) only dividends on Cumulative Shares shall be cumulative as set forth herein. Subject to the provisions of Section s 2 through 5, both inclusive, and Item XIII of this Division, which provisions shall apply to all Class I Shares, the Board of Directors hereby is authorized to cause such shares to be issued in one or more series and, with respect to each such series to determine and fix prior to the issuance thereof (and thereafter, to the extent provided in clause (b) of this Section), the following:

c) Redemption . 

i) Subject to the express terms of each series, the Corporation: 

(1) May, from time to time at the option of the Board of Directors, redeem all or any part of any redeemable series of Class I Shares at the time outstanding at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item IX; and 

(2) Shall, from time to time, make such redemptions of each series of Class I Shares as may be required to fulfill the requirements of any sinking fund provided for shares of such series at the applicable sinking

d) Liquidation . 

i) (1) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Class I Shares of any series shall be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or distributed among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class I Shares, the amounts fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this Item IX, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. In the event the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient to permit the payment upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares of the full preferential amount to which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed ratably upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares in proportion to the full preferential amount to which each such share is entitled. 

(2) After payment to the holders of Class I Shares of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, the holders of Class I Shares, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. 

ii) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other Corporation, the merger of any other Corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Section. 

e) Voting . 

i) The holders of Class I Shares shall have no voting rights, except as provided in this Section or required by law. 

ii) (1) If, and so often as, the Corporation shall be in default in the payment of dividends on any series of Class I Shares at the time outstanding, whether or not earned or declared, for a number of dividend payment periods, whether consecutive or not, which in the aggregate contain at least 540 days, all holders of such Class I Shares, voting separately as a class, together with all Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares and Noncumulative Shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable under the circumstances described in Subsection 5(c), shall be entitled to elect, as herein provided, a total of two members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that the holders of such Class I Shares shall not exercise such special class voting rights except at meetings of such shareholders for the election of directors at which the holders of not less than 50 of such Class I Shares are present in person or by proxy; and provided further that the special class voting rights provided for in this paragraph when the same shall have become vested shall remain so vested until all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Class I Shares then outstanding shall have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment, whereupon the holders of such Class I Shares shall be divested of their special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in the event above specified in this paragraph. All dividend payments made on the Class I Shares, at any time during which the Corporation is in default in the payment of dividends on such Class I Shares for any dividend period, shall be deemed to be made in respect of the earliest dividend period with respect to which the Corporation is in default. 

(2) In the event of default entitling holders of Class I Shares to elect two directors as specified in paragraph (1) of this Subsection, a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing such directors shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called by, the holders of record of at least 10 of the Class I Shares upon which such default in the payment of dividends exists and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders shall be called to be held within 90 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Class I Shares. At any meeting at which such holders of Class I Shares shall be entitled to elect directors, holders of 50 of such Class I Shares, present in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the members of the Board of Directors which such holders of Class I Shares are entitled to elect as herein provided. Notwithstanding any provision of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Code of Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of directors of the Corporation, the two directors who may be elected by such holders of Class I Shares pursuant to this Subsection shall serve in addition to any other directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Nothing in this Subsection shall prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of or classifications of directors of the Corporation or require the resignation of any director elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Notwithstanding any classification of the other directors of the Corporation, the two directors elected by such holders of Class I Shares shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 

(3) Upon any divesting of the special class voting rights of the holders of the Class I Shares in respect of elections of directors as provided in this Subsection, the terms of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders shall terminate immediately thereupon. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders voting as a class may elect a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 

iii) If at any time when the holders of Class I Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section the holders of any Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class J Shares, Class K Shares or Noncumulative Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant hereto by reason of any default in the payment of dividends thereon, then the voting rights of the Cumulative Shares and the Noncumulative Shares then entitled to vote shall be combined (with each class of shares having a number of votes proportional to the aggregate liquidation preference of its outstanding shares). In such case, the holders of Class I Shares and of all such other shares then entitled so to vote, voting as a class, shall elect such directors. If the holders of any such other shares have elected such directors prior to the happening of the default or event permitting the holders of Class I Shares to elect directors, or prior to a written request for the holding of a special meeting being received by the Secretary of the 

Corporation as required above, then a new election shall be held with all such other shares and the Class I Shares voting together as a single class for such directors, resulting in the termination of the term of such previously elected directors upon the election of such new directors. 

iv) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Class I Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to effect either of the following: 

(1) Any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class I Shares which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class I Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class I Shares nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class I Shares; or 

(2) The authorization, creation or increase in the authorized number of any shares, or any security convertible into shares, in either case ranking prior to such series of Class I Shares. 

(e) In the event, and only to the extent, that (1) Class I Shares are issued in more than one series and (2) Ohio law permits the holders of a series of a class of capital stock to vote separately as a class, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of each series of Class I Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such matters, shall be required for any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class I Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class I Shares nor the Amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series.

i) Subject to the express terms of each series, the Corporation: 

(1) May, from time to time at the option of the Board of Directors, redeem all or any part of any redeemable series of Class J Shares at the time outstanding at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item X; and

(2) After payment to the holders of Class J Shares of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, the holders of Class J Shares, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. 

ii) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other Corporation, the merger of any other Corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Section.

Notwithstanding any provision of these Amended and Restated 

Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Code of Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of directors of the Corporation, the two directors who may be elected by such holders of Class J Shares pursuant to this Subsection shall serve in addition to any other directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Nothing in this Subsection shall prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of or classifications of directors of the Corporation or require the resignation of any director elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Notwithstanding any classification of the other directors of the Corporation, the two directors elected by such holders of Class J Shares shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 

(3) Upon any divesting of the special class voting rights of the holders of the Class J Shares in respect of elections of directors as provided in this Subsection, the terms of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders shall terminate immediately thereupon. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders voting as a class may elect a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 

iii) If at any time when the holders of Class J Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section the holders of any Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class K Shares or Noncumulative Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant hereto by reason of any default in the payment of dividends thereon, then the voting rights of the Cumulative Shares and the Noncumulative Shares then entitled to vote shall be combined (with each class of shares having a number of votes proportional to the aggregate liquidation preference of its outstanding shares). In such case, the holders of Class J Shares and of all such other shares then entitled so to vote, voting as a class, shall elect such directors. If the holders of any such other shares have elected such directors prior to the happening of the default or event permitting the holders of Class J Shares to elect directors, or prior to a written request for the holding of a special meeting being received by the Secretary of the Corporation as required above, then a new election shall be held with all such other shares and the Class J Shares voting together as a single class for such directors, resulting in the termination of the term of such previously elected directors upon the election of such new directors. 

iv) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Class J Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to effect either of the following: 

(1) Any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class J Shares which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class J Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class J Shares nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class J Shares; or 

(2) The authorization, creation or increase in the authorized number of any shares, or any security convertible into shares, in either case ranking prior to such series of Class J Shares. 

v) In the event, and only to the extent, that (1) Class J Shares are issued in more than one series and (2) Ohio law permits the holders of a series of a class of capital stock to vote separately as a class, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of each series of Class J Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such matters, shall be required for any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class J Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class J Shares nor the Amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series. 

f) 6.50 Class J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares . Of the 750,000 authorized Class J Shares, 400,000 shares are designated as a series entitled 6.50 Class J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (hereinafter called 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares ). The 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares shall have the express terms set forth in this Division as being applicable to all Class J Shares as a class and, in addition, the following express terms applicable to all 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares as a series of Class J Shares:

Dividends for the initial dividend period on the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares, or for any period shorter or longer than a full dividend period on the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares, shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The aggregate dividend payable quarterly to each holder of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent with .00005 being rounded upward. Each dividend shall be payable to the holders of record as of the close of business on the applicable record date, which shall be the first day of the calendar month in which the applicable Dividend Payment Date falls or on such other date as shall be fixed by the Corporation s Board of Directors that is no less than ten nor more than 30 days preceding the applicable Dividend Payment Date (the Dividend Record Date ), in each case whether or not such day is a Business Day. 
 (c) Dividends on 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares shall be cumulative as follows: 

(1) with respect to shares included in the initial issue of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares and shares issued any time thereafter up to and including the Dividend Record Date for the First Dividend Payment Date, dividends shall be cumulative from the date of the initial issue of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares; and 

(2) with respect to shares issued any time after the aforesaid Dividend Record Date, dividends shall be cumulative from the Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, except that if such shares are issued during the period commencing the day after the Dividend Record Date for the payment of a dividend on 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares and ending on the Dividend Payment Date of that dividend, dividends with respect to such shares shall be cumulative from that Dividend Payment Date. 

Accrued but unpaid dividends on 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares shall not bear interest. Any dividend payment made on the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares which remains payable. 
 (d) Except as required to preserve the Corporation s status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and except pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right (as defined in this Section 6(d)), the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares may not be redeemed prior to August 1, 2017. 

At any time or from time to time on and after August 1, 2017, the Corporation, at its option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days written notice, may redeem the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 500.00 per share plus, in each case, an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to, but not including, the redemption date, without interest (the Optional Redemption Right ). Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in clause (h) of this Section 6), the Corporation, at its option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days written notice, may redeem the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred, at a redemption price of 500.00 per share plus, in each case, an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to, but not including, the redemption date, without interest (the Special Optional Redemption Right ). 
 If, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as defined in clause (h) of this Section 6), the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its exercise of any of its redemption rights with respect to the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares (whether pursuant to the Optional Redemption Right or the Special Optional Redemption Right), the holders of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares will not have the Change of Control Conversion Right (as defined in clause (e) of this Section 6) in respect of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares called for redemption. 

If less than all of the outstanding 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be practicable without creating fractional shares), or by any other equitable method determined by the Corporation that will not result in the issuance of any 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit (as defined in Section (a) of Item XIV of this Division A of this Article FOURTH). 
 Notice of redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid, as of a date set by the Corporation not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, addressed to the respective holders of record of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares to be redeemed at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation. 
 (1) No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares except as to the holder to whom such notice was defective or not given. 

(2) redemption notice which has been mailed in the manner provided herein shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date mailed whether or not the holder received the redemption notice. 

In addition to any information required by the applicable rules of any securities exchange upon which the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares may be listed or admitted to trading, each such notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares to be redeemed; (iv) the place or places where certificates, if any, for the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares to be redeemed are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends in respect of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date. If less than all of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice shall state the number of such 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed. 
 (3) In the event the Corporation is exercising the Special Optional Redemption Right, the notice referred to above shall also state: (i) that the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares are being redeemed pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right in connection with the occurrence of a Change of Control and a brief description of the transaction(s) constituting such Change of Control; and (ii) that the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares to which such notice relates may not be tendered for conversion in connection with the Change of Control by the holder thereof and that each 6.50 Class J Preferred Share so tendered for conversion that is selected, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the related date of redemption instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date. 

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding and except as otherwise required by law, the holders of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable with respect to their 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption thereof after such Dividend Record Date and on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date or the Corporation s default in the payment of the dividend due on such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided in this Section 6, the Corporation will make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares called for redemption. 
 (e) 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares shall not be convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Corporation, except as provided in this Section 6(e) and/or except in connection with the exercise of the Corporation s rights pursuant to Section (d) of Item XIV of this Division A of this Article FOURTH, Section 4(d) of Division B of this Article FOURTH, or any similar Section hereafter contained in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended. 

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares shall have the right, unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares pursuant to the Optional Redemption Right or Special Optional Redemption Right, to convert some or all of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares held by such holder (the Change of Control Conversion Right on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of Common Shares (or equivalent value of Alternative Conversion Consideration (as defined in this Section 6(e))) per 6.50 Class J Preferred Share to be converted (the Common Shares Conversion Consideration equal to the lesser of (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the sum of 500.00 per share plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid dividends will be included in this sum) by (2) the Common Share 

Price (as defined in clause (h) of this Section 6); and (ii) 66.8896 (the Share Cap ), subject to the adjustments described in the following paragraph. 
 Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding and except as otherwise required by law, the persons who are holders of record of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of those shares after such Dividend Record Date and on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date and, in such case, the full amount of such dividend shall be paid on such Dividend Payment Date to the persons who were the holders of record of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date. 
 The Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits (including those effected pursuant to a distribution of Common Shares), subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a Share Split with respect to Common Shares as follows: the adjusted Share Cap as the result of a Share Split will be the number of Common Shares that is equivalent to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such Share Split by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding after giving effect to such Share Split and the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to such Share Split. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the aggregate number of Common Shares (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) issuable in connection with the exercise of the Change of Control Conversion Right shall not exceed 26,756,000 Common Shares (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) (the Exchange Cap ). The Exchange Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Share Splits on the same basis as the corresponding adjustment to the Share Cap and is subject to increase in the event that additional 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares are designated and issued in the future pursuant to an amendment to these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended. 
 In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Shares will be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any combination thereof) (the Alternative Form Consideration ), a holder of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares will receive upon conversion of such 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares the kind and amount of Alternative Form Consideration that such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the Change of Control had such holder held a number of Common Shares equal to the Common Shares Conversion Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Change of Control (the Alternative Conversion Consideration the Common Shares Conversion Consideration or the Alternative Conversion Consideration, as may be applicable to a Change of Control, is referred to as the Conversion Consideration ). 
 If the holders of Common Shares have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Change of Control, the consideration that the holders of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares will receive will be in the form and proportion of the aggregate consideration elected by the holders of Common Shares who participate in the determination (based on the weighted average of elections) and will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Shares are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in the Change of Control. 
 No fractional Common Shares will be issued upon the conversion of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares. In lieu of fractional shares, holders shall be entitled to receive the cash value of such fractional shares based on the Common Share Price (as defined in clause (h) of this Section 6). 
 Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Corporation shall deliver a notice of occurrence of the Change of Control, describing the resulting Change of Control Conversion Right, to the holders of record of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation. 
 (1) No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the conversion of any 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. 

(2) Each such notice shall state (i) the events constituting the Change of Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Control; (iii) the last date on which the holders of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares may exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right; (iv) the method and period for calculating the Common Share Price; (v) the Change of Control Conversion Date; (vi) that if, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem all or any portion of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares, holders of such shares will not be able to convert such shares and such shares will be redeemed on the related redemption date, even if such shares have already been tendered for conversion pursuant to the Change of 

Control Conversion Right; (vii) if applicable, the type and amount of Alternative Conversion Consideration entitled to be received per 6.50 Class J Preferred Share; (viii) the name and address of the paying agent and the conversion agent; (ix) the procedures that the holders of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares must follow to exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right; and (x) the last date on which the holders of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares may withdraw shares surrendered for conversion and the procedures that such holders must follow to effect such a withdrawal. 

The Corporation shall issue a press release for publication on the Dow Jones Company, Inc., Business Wire, PR Newswire or Bloomberg Business News (or, if these organizations are not in existence at the time of issuance of the press release, such other news or press organization as is reasonably calculated to broadly disseminate the relevant information to the public), or post notice on the Corporation s website, in any event prior to the opening of business on the first Business Day following any date on which the Corporation provides the Change of Control notice described above to the holders of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares. 
 In order to exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right, a holder of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares shall be required to deliver, on or before the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the certificates, if any, evidencing the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares to be converted, duly endorsed for transfer, together with a written conversion notice completed, to the Corporation s transfer agent. 
 (3) Such notice shall state (i) the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date; (ii) the number of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares to be converted; and (iii) that the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares are to be converted pursuant to the applicable provisions of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares. 

(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares are held in global form, such notice shall comply with applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company or any other organization acting as depositary for the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares (the Depositary ). 

Holders of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares may withdraw any notice of exercise of a Change of Control Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Corporation s transfer agent prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date. 
 (5) The notice of withdrawal must state: (i) the number of withdrawn 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares; (ii) if certificated 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares have been issued, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares; and (iii) the number of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares, if any, which remain subject to the conversion notice. 

(6) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares are held in global form, such notice of withdrawal shall comply with applicable procedures of the Depositary. 

6.50 Class J Preferred Shares as to which the Change of Control Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not been properly withdrawn shall be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Conversion Right on the Change of Control Conversion Date, unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem such 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares, whether pursuant to the Optional Redemption Right or Special Optional Redemption Right. If the Corporation elects to redeem 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares that would otherwise be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control Conversion Date, such 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares shall not be so converted and the holders of such shares shall be entitled to receive on the applicable redemption date 500.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date. 
 The Corporation shall deliver the applicable Conversion Consideration to the applicable holders of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares no later than the third Business Day following the Change of Control Conversion Date. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no holder of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares will be entitled to convert such shares to the extent that receipt of Common Shares upon conversion of the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares would cause such holder (or any other person) to exceed either of the ownership limits described in Section (a) of Item XIV of this Division A of this Article FOURTH and Section 4(a) of Division B of this Article FOURTH, unless the Corporation provides an exemption from such ownership limits for such holder. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions on the ability to convert the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares, any conversion of 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares in violation of the ownership limits described in Section (a) of Item XIV of this Division A of this Article FOURTH and Section 4(a) of Division B of this Article FOURTH, or that causes another person to be in violation of such ownership limits, including as a result of the effect of the operation of this provision, shall be construed as causing any 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares that exceed such ownership limits to be deemed Excess Preferred Shares and subject to the provisions applicable to Excess Preferred Shares set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended. 
 (f) The amount payable per 6.50 Class J Preferred Share in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation shall be 500.00, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to, but not including, the date of payment. 

(g) All dividend payments made on the 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares, at any time during which the Corporation is in default in the payment of dividends on such 6.50 Class J Preferred Shares for any dividend period, shall, for the purposes of Section 5(b)(1) of this Item X, be deemed to be made in respect of the earliest dividend period with respect to which the Corporation is in default.

c) Redemption . 

i) Subject to the express terms of each series, the Corporation: 

(1) May, from time to time at the option of the Board of Directors, redeem all or any part of any redeemable series of Class K Shares at the time outstanding at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Item XI; and

(2) If the holders of Class K Shares which have been called for redemption shall not within six years after such deposit claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the Corporation shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and to such holders. 

iii) Any Class K Shares which are (1) redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of this Section, (2) purchased and delivered in satisfaction of any sinking fund requirements provided for shares of such series, (3) converted in accordance with the express terms thereof, or (4) otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall resume the status of authorized but unissued Class K Shares without serial designation.

d) Liquidation . 

i) (1) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Class K Shares of any series shall be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or distributed among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class K Shares, the amounts fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this Item XI, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. In the event the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient to permit the payment upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares of the full preferential amount to which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed ratably upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares in proportion to the full preferential amount to which each such share is entitled. 

(2) After payment to the holders of Class K Shares of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, the holders of Class K Shares, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. 

ii) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other Corporation, the merger of any other Corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Section. 

e) Voting . 

i) The holders of Class K Shares shall have no voting rights, except as provided in this Section or required by law. 

ii) (1) If, and so often as, the Corporation shall be in default in the payment of dividends on any series of Class K Shares at the time outstanding, whether or not earned or declared, for a number of dividend payment periods, whether consecutive or not, which in the aggregate contain at least 540 days, all holders of such Class K Shares, voting separately as a class, together with all Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares and Noncumulative Shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable under the circumstances described in Subsection 5(c), shall be entitled to elect, as herein provided, a total of two members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that the holders of such Class K Shares shall not 

exercise such special class voting rights except at meetings of such shareholders for the election of directors at which the holders of not less than 50 of such Class K Shares are present in person or by proxy; and provided further that the special class voting rights provided for in this paragraph when the same shall have become vested shall remain so vested until all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Class K Shares then outstanding shall have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment, whereupon the holders of such Class K Shares shall be divested of their special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in the event above specified in this paragraph. All dividend payments made on the Class K Shares, at any time during which the Corporation is in default in the payment of dividends on such Class K Shares for any dividend period, shall be deemed to be made in respect of the earliest dividend period with respect to which the Corporation is in default. 

(2) In the event of default entitling holders of Class K Shares to elect two directors as specified in paragraph (1) of this Subsection, a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing such directors shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called by, the holders of record of at least 10 of the Class K Shares upon which such default in the payment of dividends exists and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders shall be called to be held within 90 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Class K Shares. At any meeting at which such holders of Class K Shares shall be entitled to elect directors, holders of 50 of such Class K Shares, present in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the members of the Board of Directors which such holders of Class K Shares are entitled to elect as herein provided. Notwithstanding any provision of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Code of Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of directors of the Corporation, the two directors who may be elected by such holders of Class K Shares pursuant to this Subsection shall serve in addition to any other directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Nothing in this Subsection shall prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of or classifications of directors of the Corporation or require the resignation of any director elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. 

Notwithstanding any classification of the other directors of the Corporation, the two directors elected by such holders of Class K Shares shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 
 (3) Upon any divesting of the special class voting rights of the holders of the Class K Shares in respect of elections of directors as provided in this Subsection, the terms of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders shall terminate immediately thereupon. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders voting as a class may elect a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 

iii) If at any time when the holders of Class K Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section the holders of any Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares, Class G Shares, Class H Shares, Class I Shares, Class J Shares or Noncumulative Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant hereto by reason of any default in the payment of dividends thereon, then the voting rights of the Cumulative Shares and the Noncumulative Shares then entitled to vote shall be combined (with each class of shares having a number of votes proportional to the aggregate liquidation preference of its outstanding shares). In such case, the holders of Class K Shares and of all such other shares then entitled so to vote, voting as a class, shall elect such directors. If the holders of any such other shares have elected such directors prior to the happening of the default or event permitting the holders of Class K Shares to elect directors, or prior to a written request for the holding of a special meeting being received by the Secretary of the Corporation as required above, then a new election shall be held with all such other shares and the Class K Shares voting together as a single class for such directors, resulting in the termination of the term of such previously elected directors upon the election of such new directors. 

iv) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Class K Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to effect either of the following: 

(1) Any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the 

holders of Class K Shares which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class K Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class K Shares nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class K Shares; or 

(2) The authorization, creation or increase in the authorized number of any shares, or any security convertible into shares, in either case ranking prior to such series of Class K Shares. 

v) In the event, and only to the extent, that (1) Class K Shares are issued in more than one series and (2) Ohio law permits the holders of a series of a class of capital stock to vote separately as a class, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of each series of Class K Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such matters, shall be required for any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Class K Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class K Shares nor the Amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series. 

f) 6.250 Class K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares . Of the 750,000 authorized Class K Shares, 345,000 shares are designated as a series entitled 6.250 Class K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (hereinafter called 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares ).

The aggregate dividend payable quarterly to each holder of 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent with .00005 being rounded upward. Each dividend shall be payable to the holders of record as of the close of business on the applicable record date, which shall be the first day of the calendar month in which the applicable Dividend Payment Date falls or on such other date as shall be fixed by the Corporation s Board of Directors that is no less than ten nor more than 30 days preceding the applicable Dividend Payment Date (the Dividend Record Date ), in each case whether or not such day is a Business Day. 
 iii) Dividends on 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares shall be cumulative as follows:

(2) with respect to shares issued any time after the aforesaid Dividend Record Date, dividends shall be cumulative from the Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, except that if such shares are issued during the period commencing the day after the Dividend Record Date for the payment of a dividend on 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares and ending on the Dividend Payment Date of that dividend, dividends with respect to such shares shall be cumulative from that Dividend Payment Date. 

Accrued but unpaid dividends on 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares shall not bear interest. Any dividend payment made on the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares which remains payable. 
 iv) Except as required to preserve the Corporation s status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and except pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right (as defined in this Section 6(d)), the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares may not be redeemed prior to April 9, 2018.

 If less than all of the outstanding 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be practicable without creating fractional shares), or by any other equitable method determined by the Corporation that will not result in the issuance of any 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit (as defined in Section (a) of Item XIV of this Division A of this Article FOURTH). 
 Notice of redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid, as of a date set by the Corporation not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, addressed to the respective holders of record of the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares to be redeemed at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation. 
 (1) No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares except as to the holder to whom such notice was defective or not given. 

(2) A redemption notice which has been mailed in the manner provided herein shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date mailed whether or not the holder received the redemption notice. 

In addition to any information required by the applicable rules of any securities exchange upon which the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares may be listed or admitted to trading, each such notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares to be redeemed; (iv) the place or places where certificates, if any, for the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares to be redeemed are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends in respect of the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date. If less than all of the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice shall state the number of such 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed. 
 (3) In the event the Corporation is exercising the Special Optional Redemption Right, the notice referred to above shall also state: (i) that the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares are being redeemed pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right in connection with the occurrence of a Change of Control and a brief description of the transaction(s) constituting such Change of Control; and (ii) that the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares to which such notice relates may not be tendered for conversion in connection with the Change of Control by the holder thereof and that each 6.250 Class K Preferred Share so tendered for conversion that is selected, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the related redemption date instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date. 

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding and except as otherwise required by law, the holders of 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable with respect to their 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption thereof after such Dividend Record Date and on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date or the Corporation s default in the payment of the dividend due on such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided in this Section 6, the Corporation will make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares called for redemption. 
 v) 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares shall not be convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Corporation, except as provided in this Section 6(e) and/or except in connection with the exercise of the Corporation s rights pursuant to Section (d) of Item XIV of this Division A of this Article FOURTH, Section 4(d) of Division B of this Article FOURTH, or any similar Section hereafter contained in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended. 

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares shall have the right, unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares pursuant to the Optional Redemption Right or Special Optional Redemption Right, to convert some or all of the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares held by such holder (the Change of Control Conversion Right on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of Common Shares (or equivalent value of Alternative Conversion Consideration (as defined in this Section 6(e))) per 6.250 Class K Preferred Share to be converted (the Common Shares Conversion Consideration equal to the lesser of (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the sum of 500.00 per share plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid dividends will be included in this sum) by (2) the Common Share Price (as defined in clause (h) of this Section 6); and (ii) 57.1102 (the Share Cap ), subject to the adjustments described in the following paragraph. 
 Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding and except as otherwise required by law, the persons who are holders of record of 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of those shares after such Dividend Record Date and on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date and, in such case, the full amount of such dividend shall be paid on such Dividend Payment Date to the persons who were the holders of record of 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date. 
 The Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits (including those effected pursuant to a distribution of Common Shares), subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a Share Split with respect to Common Shares as follows: the adjusted Share Cap as the result of a Share Split will be the number of Common Shares that is equivalent to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such Share Split by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding after giving effect to such Share Split and the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to such Share Split. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the aggregate number of Common Shares (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) issuable in connection with the exercise of the Change of Control Conversion Right shall not exceed 17,133,000 Common Shares (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable), subject to increase to the extent the underwriters over-allotment option to purchase additional 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares in the initial public offering of 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares is exercised, not to exceed 19,702,950 Common Shares in total (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) (the Exchange Cap ). The Exchange Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Share Splits on the same basis as the corresponding adjustment to the Share Cap and is subject to increase in the event that additional 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares are designated and issued in the future pursuant to an amendment to these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended. 
 In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Shares will be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any combination thereof) (the Alternative Form Consideration ), a holder of 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares will receive upon conversion of such 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares the kind and amount of Alternative Form Consideration that such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the Change of Control had such holder held a number of Common Shares equal to the Common Shares Conversion Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Change of Control (the Alternative Conversion Consideration the Common Shares Conversion Consideration or the Alternative Conversion Consideration, as may be applicable to a Change of Control, is referred to as the Conversion Consideration ). 

If the holders of Common Shares have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Change of Control, the consideration that the holders of the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares will receive will be in the form and proportion of the aggregate consideration elected by the holders of Common Shares who participate in the determination (based on the weighted average of elections) and will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Shares are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in the Change of Control. 
 No fractional Common Shares will be issued upon the conversion of the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares. In lieu of fractional shares, holders shall be entitled to receive the cash value of such fractional shares based on the Common Share Price. 
 Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Corporation shall deliver a notice of occurrence of the Change of Control, describing the resulting Change of Control Conversion Right, to the holders of record of the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation. 
 (1) No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the conversion of any 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. 

(2) Each such notice shall state (i) the events constituting the Change of Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Control; (iii) the last date on which the holders of the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares may exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right; (iv) the method and period for calculating the Common Share Price; (v) the Change of Control Conversion Date; (vi) that if, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem all or any portion of the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares, holders of such shares will not be able to convert such shares and such shares will be redeemed on the related redemption date, even if such shares have already been tendered for conversion pursuant to the Change of Control Conversion Right; (vii) if applicable, the type and amount of Alternative Conversion Consideration entitled to be received per 6.250 Class K Preferred Share; (viii) the name and address of the paying agent and the conversion agent; (ix) the procedures that the holders of the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares must follow to exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right; and (x) the last date on which the holders of the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares may withdraw shares surrendered for conversion and the procedures that such holders must follow to effect such a withdrawal. 

The Corporation shall issue a press release for publication on the Dow Jones Company, Inc., Business Wire, PR Newswire or Bloomberg Business News (or, if these organizations are not in existence at the time of issuance of the press release, such other news or press organization as is reasonably calculated to broadly disseminate the relevant information to the public), or post notice on the Corporation s website, in any event prior to the opening of business on the first Business Day following any date on which the Corporation provides the Change of Control notice described above to the holders of the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares. 
 In order to exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right, a holder of 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares shall be required to deliver, on or before the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the certificates, if any, evidencing the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares to be converted, duly endorsed for transfer, together with a written conversion notice completed, to the Corporation s transfer agent. 
 (1) Such notice shall state (i) the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date; (ii) the number of 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares to be converted; and (iii) that the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares are to be converted pursuant to the applicable provisions of the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares. 

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares are held in global form, such notice shall comply with applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company or any other organization acting as depositary for the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares (the Depositary ). 

Holders of 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares may withdraw any notice of exercise of a Change of Control Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Corporation s transfer agent prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date. 
 (1) The notice of withdrawal must state: (i) the number of withdrawn 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares; (ii) if certificated 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares have been issued, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares; and (iii) the number of 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares, if any, which remain subject to the conversion notice. 

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares are held in global form, such notice of withdrawal shall comply with applicable procedures of the Depositary. 

6.250 Class K Preferred Shares as to which the Change of Control Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not been properly withdrawn shall be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Conversion Right on the Change of Control Conversion Date, unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem such 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares, whether pursuant to the Optional Redemption Right or Special Optional Redemption Right. If the Corporation elects to redeem 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares that would otherwise be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control Conversion Date, such 6.250 Class K Preferred Shares shall not be so converted and the holders of such shares shall be entitled to receive on the applicable redemption date 500.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date.

d) Liquidation . 

i) (1)(a) (1) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Noncumulative Shares of any series shall be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or distributed among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Noncumulative Shares, the amounts fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this Item XII, plus an amount equal to all 

dividends accrued and unpaid thereon for the then current dividend period to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. In the event the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient to permit the payment upon all outstanding Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares of the full preferential amount to which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed ratably upon all outstanding Noncumulative Shares in proportion to the full preferential amount to which each such share is entitled. 

(2) After payment to the holders of Noncumulative Shares of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, the holders of Noncumulative Shares, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. 

ii) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other Corporation, the merger of any other Corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Section. 

e) Voting . 

i) The holders of Noncumulative Shares shall have no voting rights, except as provided in this Section or required by law. 

ii) (1) If, and so often as, the Corporation shall not have fully paid, or shall not have declared and set aside a sum sufficient for the payment of, dividends on any series of Noncumulative Shares at the time outstanding, for a number of dividend payment periods, whether consecutive or not, which in the aggregate contain at least 540 days, the holders of such Noncumulative Shares, voting separately as a class, together with all Cumulative Shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, shall be entitled to elect, as herein provided, two members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that the holders of such Noncumulative Shares shall not exercise such special class voting rights except at meetings of such shareholders for the election of directors at which the holders of not less than 50 of such Noncumulative Shares are present in person or by proxy; and provided further, that the special class voting rights provided for in this paragraph when the same shall have become vested shall remain so vested until the Corporation shall have fully paid, or shall have set aside a sum sufficient for the payment of, dividends on such Noncumulative Shares then outstanding for a number of consecutive dividend payment periods which in the aggregate contain at least 360 days, whereupon the holders of such Noncumulative Shares shall be divested of their special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in the event above specified in this paragraph. 

(2) In the event of default entitling holders of Noncumulative Shares to elect two directors as specified in paragraph (1) of this Subsection, a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing such directors shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called by, the holders of record of at least 10 of the Noncumulative Shares upon which such default in the payment of dividends exists and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders shall be called to be held within 90 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Noncumulative Shares. At any meeting at which such holders of Noncumulative Shares shall be entitled to elect directors, holders of 50 of such Noncumulative Shares, present in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the members of the Board of Directors which such holders of Noncumulative Shares are entitled to elect as herein provided. Notwithstanding any provision of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Code of Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of directors of the Corporation, the two directors who may be elected by such holders of Noncumulative Shares pursuant to this Subsection shall serve in addition to any other directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Nothing in this Subsection shall prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of or classifications of directors of the Corporation nor require the resignation of any director elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection. Notwithstanding any classification of the other directors of the Corporation, the two directors elected by such holders of Noncumulative Shares shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 

(3) Upon any divesting of the special class voting rights of the holders of the Noncumulative Shares in respect of elections of directors as provided in this Subsection, the terms of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders shall terminate immediately thereupon. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal from office or otherwise, the 

remaining director elected by such holders voting as a class may elect a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 

iii) If at any time when the holders of Noncumulative Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section the holders of any Cumulative Shares are entitled to elect directors pursuant hereto by reason of any default in the payment of dividends thereon, then the voting rights of the Cumulative Shares and Noncumulative Shares then entitled to vote shall be combined (with class of shares having a number of votes proportional to the aggregate liquidation preference of its outstanding shares). In such case, the holders of Noncumulative Shares and of all such other shares then entitled so to vote, voting as a class, shall elect such directors. If the holders of any such other shares have elected such directors prior to the happening of the default or event permitting the holders of Noncumulative Shares to elect directors, or prior to a written request for the holding of a special meeting being received by the Secretary of the Corporation as required above, then a new election shall be held with all such other shares and the Noncumulative Shares voting together as a single class for such directors, resulting in the termination of the term of such previously elected directors upon the election of such new directors. 

iv) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Noncumulative Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to effect either of the following: 

(1) Any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Noncumulative Shares which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Noncumulative Shares or of any shares ranking on a parity with or junior to the Noncumulative Shares nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Noncumulative Shares; or 

(2) The authorization, creation or increase in the authorized number of any shares, or any security convertible into shares, in either case ranking prior to such Noncumulative Shares. 

(e) In the event, and only to the extent, that (1) Noncumulative Shares are issued in more than one series and (2) Ohio law permits the holders of a series of a class of capital stock to vote separately as a class, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of each series of the Noncumulative Shares at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such matters, shall be required for any amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely and materially the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of such series which are set forth in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended; provided, however, neither the amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding number of Noncumulative Shares or of any shares remaining on a parity with or junior to the Noncumulative Shares nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number or classification of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely and materially preferences or voting or other rights of the holder of such series.

If the Board of Directors or its designees shall at any time determine in good faith that a Transfer has taken place in violation of Section (b) of this Item XIV of this Division A of this Article FOURTH or that a Person intends to acquire or has attempted to acquire beneficial ownership (determined without reference to any rules of attribution), Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of any Preferred Shares of the Corporation in violation of Section (b) of this Item XIV of this Division A of this Article FOURTH, or that any such Transfer, intended or attempted acquisition or acquisition would jeopardize the status of the Corporation as a REIT under the Code, the Board of Directors or its designees shall take such actions as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect or to prevent such Transfer, including, but not limited to, refusing to give effect to such Transfer on the books of the Corporation or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer and, in addition, exercising its rights under Section (d) of this Item XIV of this Division A of this Article FOURTH. 

iv) Purchase Right in Excess Preferred Shares. Beginning on the date of the occurrence of a Transfer which, if consummated, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, could result in 

Excess Preferred Shares, the Excess Preferred Shares, subject to such transfer shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the Corporation, or its designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created such Excess Preferred Shares (or, in the case of a devise or gift, the Market Price at the time of such devise or gift) and (ii) the Market Price on the date the Corporation, or its designee, accepts such offer. The Corporation shall have the right to accept such offer for a period of 90 days after the later of (i) the date of such Transfer and (ii) if the Corporation does not receive a notice of such Transfer pursuant to Section (e) of this Item XIV of this Division A of this Article FOURTH, the date the Board of Directors determines in good faith that such Transfer has occurred. Prompt payment of the purchase price shall be made in such reasonable manner as may be determined by the Corporation. From and after the date fixed for purchase by the Corporation, and so long as payment of the purchase price for the Excess Preferred Shares to be so purchased shall have been made or duly provided for, the holder of any Excess Preferred Shares so called for purchase shall cease to be entitled to dividends, distributions, voting rights and other benefits with respect to such Excess Preferred Shares, excepting only the right to payment of the purchase price fixed as aforesaid. Any dividend or distribution paid to a proposed transferee of Excess Preferred Shares prior to the discovery by the Corporation that the Excess Preferred Shares have been transferred in violation of Section (b) of this Item XIV of this Division A of this Article FOURTH shall be repaid to the Corporation upon demand. If the foregoing provisions are determined to be void or invalid by virtue of any legal decision, statute, rule or regulation, then the intended transferee of such Excess Preferred Shares shall be deemed, at the option of the Corporation, to have acted as agent on behalf of the Corporation in acquiring such Excess Preferred Shares and to hold such Excess Preferred Shares on behalf of the Corporation. 

v) Notice of Restricted Transfer. Any Person who acquires or attempts to acquire Preferred Shares or other securities in violation of subparagraph (b) of this Item XIV, or any Person who owns or will own Excess Preferred Shares as a result of an event under subparagraph (b) of this Item XIV, shall immediately give written notice to the Corporation of such event and shall provide to the Corporation such other information as the Corporation may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such Transfer or attempted Transfer or other event on the Corporation s status as a REIT. 

vi) Owners Required to Provide Information. From and after the date of the Initial Public Offering: 

(i) every Beneficial Owner of more than 5.0 (or such other percentage, between 0.5 and 5.0 , as provided in the regulations promulgated pursuant to the Code) of the outstanding Preferred Shares of the Corporation shall, within 30 days after January 1 of each year, give written notice to the Corporation stating the name and address of such Beneficial Owner, the number of shares Beneficially Owned, and description of how such shares are held. Each such Beneficial Owner shall provide to the Corporation such additional information as the Corporation may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such Beneficial Ownership on the Corporation s status as a REIT. 

(ii) each Person who is a Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner of Preferred Shares and each Person (including the shareholder of record) who is holding Preferred Shares for a Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner shall provide to the Corporation such information that the Corporation may request, in good faith, in order to determine the Corporation s status as a REIT. 

(g) Remedies Not Limited. Nothing contained in this Division A of this Article FOURTH shall limit the authority of the Board of Directors to take such other action as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the Corporation and the interests of its shareholders by preservation of the Corporation s status as a REIT. 

(h) Ambiguity. In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this Item XIV of this Division A of this Article FOURTH, including any definition contained in Section (a) of this Item XIV, the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the application of the provisions of this Item XIV with respect to any situation based on the facts known to it. 

(1) Exceptions . 

(i) Subject to Section (b)(iv) of this Item XIV of this Division A, the Board of Directors may exempt a Person from the Ownership Limit applicable to a series of a class of Preferred Shares if such Person is not an individual (other than pension plans described in Section 856(h)(3)) for purposes of Section 542(a)(2) of the Code if the Board of Directors obtains such representations and undertakings from such Person as are reasonably necessary to ascertain that no individual s Beneficial Ownership of such Preferred Shares will violate the Ownership Limit, and agrees that any violation or attempted violation will result in such Preferred Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit being subject to repurchase by the Corporation as set forth in Section (d) of this Item XIV of this Division A of this Article FOURTH.

No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Voting Preferred Shares that may be in arrears. Any dividend payment made on the Voting Preferred Shares shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares which remains payable. 

ii) If, for any taxable year, the Corporation elects to designate as capital gain dividends (as defined in Section 857 of the Code) any portion (the Capital Gains Amount of the total distributions (as determined for federal income tax purposes) paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of capital stock (the Total Dividends ), then the portion of the Capital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to holders of Voting Preferred Shares shall be in the same proportion that the Total Dividends paid or made available to the holders of Voting Preferred Shares for the year bears to the Total Dividends. If, for any taxable year, the Corporation elects, as provided in Section 857(b)(3)(D) of the Code, to designate as undistributed capital gains any portion of the Corporation s total net capital gains for the taxable year, then such undistributed capital gains shall be allocated between the holders of the Voting Preferred Shares and the holders of other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation in a manner that is consistent with such allocations being considered other than a preferential dividend within the meaning of Section 562(c) of the Code. 

iii) So long as any of the Voting Preferred Shares are outstanding, except as described in the immediately following sentence, no dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation and no other distribution of cash or other property shall be declared or made, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation with respect to any shares ranking on a parity unless, in each case, dividends equal to the full amount of accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends on all outstanding Voting Preferred Shares have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been or contemporaneously is set apart for payment of such dividends on the Voting Preferred Shares for all Dividend Periods ending on or prior to the date such dividend or distribution is declared, paid, set apart for payment or made, as the case may be, with respect to such shares ranking on a parity. When dividends are not paid in full or a sum sufficient for such payment is not set apart, as aforesaid, all dividends declared upon the Voting Preferred Shares and all dividends declared upon any shares ranking on a parity shall be declared ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of dividends accumulated, accrued and unpaid on the Voting Preferred Shares and accumulated, accrued and unpaid on such shares ranking on a parity. 

iv) So long as any of the Voting Preferred Shares are outstanding, no dividends (other than dividends or distributions paid in shares, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares, ranking junior to the 

Voting Preferred Shares) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation and no other distribution of cash or other property shall be declared or made, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation with respect to any shares ranking junior to the Voting Preferred Shares, nor shall any shares ranking junior to the Voting Preferred Shares be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired (other than a redemption, purchase or other acquisition of Common Shares made for purposes of an employee incentive, benefit or stock purchase plan of the Corporation or any subsidiary) for any consideration (or any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock), directly or indirectly, by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for shares, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares, ranking junior to the Voting Preferred Shares), nor shall any other cash or other property otherwise be paid or distributed to or for the benefit of any holder of shares ranking junior to the Voting Preferred Shares in respect thereof, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation unless, in each case, dividends equal to the full amount of all accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends on all outstanding Voting Preferred Shares have been declared and paid, or such dividends have been declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set apart for such payment, on all outstanding Voting Preferred Shares for all Dividend Periods ending on or prior to the date such dividend or distribution is declared, paid, set apart for payment or made with respect to such shares ranking junior to the Voting Preferred Shares, or the date such shares ranking junior to the Voting Preferred Shares are redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired or monies paid to or made available for any sinking fund for such redemption, or the date any such cash or other property is paid or distributed to or for the benefit of any holders of shares ranking junior to the Voting Preferred Shares in respect thereof, as the case may be. 

v) In determining the extent to which a distribution with respect to the Voting Preferred Shares constitutes a dividend for tax purposes, the earnings and profits of the Corporation will be allocated, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the ranking of the class of capital stock or series of capital stock, constituting a class within the meaning of Code Section 562(c), of the Corporation, as described in Section 7. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3, the Corporation shall not be prohibited from (i) declaring or paying or setting apart for payment any dividend or distribution on any shares ranking junior to or on a parity with the Voting Preferred Shares or (ii) redeeming, purchasing or otherwise acquiring any shares ranking junior to or on a parity with the Voting Preferred Shares, in each case, if such declaration, payment, redemption, purchase or other acquisition is necessary in order to assist in maintaining the continued qualification of the Corporation as a REIT under Section 856 of the Code. 
 d) Liquidation Preference . (a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution by the Corporation (whether of capital, surplus or otherwise) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of shares ranking junior to the Voting Preferred Shares, the holders of Voting Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive Twenty-Five Dollars 25.00) per Voting Preferred Share (the Liquidation Preference ), plus an amount equal to all dividends accumulated, accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders; but such holders shall not be entitled to any further payment. Until the holders of the Voting Preferred Shares have been paid the Liquidation Preference in full, plus an amount equal to all dividends accumulated, accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders, no payment will be made to any holder of shares ranking junior to the Voting Preferred Shares upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of Voting Preferred Shares shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any other shares ranking on a parity with the Voting Preferred Shares, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of Voting Preferred Shares and any such other shares ranking on a parity with the Voting Preferred Shares ratably in the same proportion as the respective amounts that would be payable on such Voting Preferred Shares and any such other shares ranking on a parity with the Voting Preferred Shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this Section 4, (i) a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into one or more other entities, (ii) a sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the Corporation s assets, or (iii) a statutory share exchange shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of the Corporation. 

ii) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of Voting Preferred Shares and any shares ranking on a parity with the Voting Preferred Shares, as provided in this Section 4, any other shares ranking junior to the Voting Preferred Shares shall, subject to the respective terms thereof, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the Voting Preferred Shares and any shares ranking on a parity with the Voting Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to share therein. 

e) Redemption at the Option of the Corporation . (a) Shares of Voting Preferred Shares shall not be redeemable by the Corporation prior to September 15, 2003. On and after September 15, 2003, the Corporation, at its option, may redeem Voting Preferred Shares, in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price payable in cash equal to 25.00 per share, plus all accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends to the date fixed for redemption (the Redemption Date ); provided, however, that in the event of a redemption of Voting Preferred Shares, if the Redemption Date occurs after a dividend record date and on or prior to the related Dividend Payment Date, the dividend payable on such Dividend Payment Date in respect of such shares called for 

redemption shall be payable on such Dividend Payment Date to the holders of record at the close of business on such dividend record date, and shall not be payable as part of the redemption price for such shares. In connection with any redemption pursuant to this Section 5(a), the redemption price of the Voting Preferred Shares (other than any portion thereof consisting of accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends) shall be payable solely with the proceeds from the sale by the Corporation of other capital shares of the Corporation (whether or not such sale occurs concurrently with such redemption). For purposes of the preceding sentence, capital shares means any common shares, preferred shares, depositary shares, participations or other ownership interests (however designated) and any rights (other than debt securities convertible into or exchangeable at the option of the holder for equity securities (unless and to the extent such debt securities are subsequently converted into capital shares)) or options to purchase any of the foregoing of or in the Corporation. 

i) The Redemption Date shall be selected by the Corporation, shall be specified in the notice of redemption and shall be not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date notice of redemption is sent by the Corporation. 

ii) If full cumulative dividends on all outstanding Voting Preferred Shares have not been declared and paid, or declared and set apart for payment, no Voting Preferred Shares may be redeemed unless all outstanding Voting Preferred Shares are simultaneously redeemed, and neither the Corporation nor any affiliate of the Corporation may purchase or acquire Voting Preferred Shares other than pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to all holders of Voting Preferred Shares. 

iii) If the Corporation shall redeem Voting Preferred Shares pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 5, notice of such redemption shall be given to each holder of record of the shares to be redeemed. Such notice shall be provided by first class mail, postage prepaid, at such holder s address as the same appears on the stock records of the Corporation. Neither the failure to mail any notice required by this paragraph (d), nor any defect therein or in the mailing thereof to any particular holder, shall affect the sufficiency of the notice or the validity of the proceedings for redemption with respect to the other holders. Any notice which was mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date mailed whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice shall state, as appropriate: (1) the Redemption Date; (2) the number of Voting Preferred Shares to be redeemed and, if fewer than all such shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the place or places at which certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for cash; and (4) the redemption price payable on such Redemption Date, including, without limitation, a statement as to whether or not accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends will be (x) payable as part of the redemption price, or (y) payable on the next Dividend Payment Date to the record holder at the close of business on the relevant record date as described in the next succeeding sentence. 

Notice having been mailed as aforesaid, from and after the Redemption Date (unless the Corporation shall fail to make available the amount of cash necessary to effect such redemption),(i) dividends on the Voting Preferred Shares so called for redemption shall cease to accumulate or accrue on the Voting Preferred Shares called for redemption, (ii) said shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and (iii) all rights of the holders thereof as holders of Voting Preferred Shares of the Corporation shall cease except the rights to receive the cash payable upon such redemption, without interest thereon, upon surrender and endorsement of their certificates if so required; provided, however, that if the Redemption Date for any Voting Preferred Shares occurs after any dividend record date and on or prior to the related Dividend Payment Date, the full dividend payable on such Dividend Payment Date in respect of such Voting Preferred Shares called for redemption shall be payable on such Dividend Payment Date to the holders of record of such shares at the close of business on the corresponding dividend record date notwithstanding the prior redemption of such shares. The Corporation s obligation to make available the redemption price in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be deemed fulfilled if, on or before the applicable Redemption Date, the Corporation shall irrevocably deposit in trust with a bank or trust company (which may not be an affiliate of the Corporation) that has, or is an affiliate of a bank or trust company that has, a capital and surplus of at least 50,000,000, such amount of cash as is necessary for such redemption plus, if such Redemption Date occurs after any dividend record date and on or prior to the related Dividend Payment Date, such amount of cash as is necessary to pay the dividend payable on such Dividend Payment Date in respect of such Voting Preferred Shares called for redemption, with irrevocable instructions that such cash be applied to the redemption of the Voting Preferred Shares so called for redemption and, if applicable, the payment of such dividend. No interest shall accrue for the benefit of the holders of Voting Preferred Shares to be redeemed on any cash so set aside by the Corporation. Subject to applicable escheat laws, any such cash unclaimed at the end of two years from the Redemption Date shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation, after which reversion the holders of Voting Preferred Shares so called for redemption shall look only to the general funds of the Corporation for the payment of such cash. 
 As promptly as practicable after the surrender in accordance with such notice of the certificates for any such Voting Preferred Shares to be so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation shall so require and the notice shall so state), such certificates shall be exchanged for cash (without interest thereon) for which such shares have been redeemed in accordance with such notice. If fewer than all the outstanding Voting Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, shares to be redeemed shall be selected by the Corporation from outstanding Voting Preferred Shares not previously called for redemption by lot or, with respect to the number of Voting Preferred Shares held of record by each holder of such shares, pro rata (as nearly as may be) or by any 

other method as may be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion to be equitable. If fewer than all the shares of Voting Preferred Shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, then a new certificate representing the unredeemed shares shall be issued without cost to the holders thereof. 
 f) Status of Reacquired Shares . All Voting Preferred Shares which shall have been issued and reacquired in any manner by the Corporation shall be deemed retired. 

g) Ranking . The Voting Preferred Shares rank prior to, on a parity with, or junior to other shares of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Item XIII of this Division A. 

h) Voting . (a) If and whenever six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on the Voting Preferred Shares or any series or class of shares ranking on a parity with the Voting Preferred Shares shall be in arrears (which shall, with respect to any such quarterly dividend, mean that any such dividend has not been paid in full), the number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two (if not already increased by reason of similar types of provisions with respect to shares ranking on a parity with the Voting Preferred Shares of any other class or series which is entitled to similar voting rights (the Arrearage Voting Preferred Shares )) and the holders of Voting Preferred Shares, together with the holders of shares of all other Arrearage Voting Preferred Shares then entitled to exercise similar voting rights, voting as a single class regardless of class or series, shall be entitled to elect the two additional directors to serve on the Board of Directors at any annual meeting of shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof, or at a special meeting of the holders of the Voting Preferred Shares and the Arrearage Voting Preferred Shares called as hereinafter provided. Whenever all arrearages in dividends on the Voting Preferred Shares and the Arrearage Voting Preferred Shares then outstanding shall have been paid and dividends thereon for the current quarterly dividend period shall have been declared and paid, or declared and set apart for payment, then the right of the holders of the Voting Preferred Shares and the Arrearage Voting Preferred Shares to elect such additional two directors shall cease (but subject always to the same provision for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar future arrearages), and the terms of office of all persons elected as directors by the holders of the Voting Preferred Shares and the Arrearage Voting Preferred Shares shall forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced accordingly. At any time after such voting power shall have been so vested in the holders of Voting Preferred Shares and the Arrearage Voting Preferred Shares, if applicable, the Secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of at least ten percent (10 of Voting Preferred Shares (addressed to the Secretary at the principal office of the Corporation) shall, call a special meeting of the holders of the Voting Preferred Shares and of the Arrearage Voting Preferred Shares for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as herein provided, such call to be made by notice similar to that provided in the Code of Regulations of the Corporation for a special meeting of the shareholders or as required by law. If any such special meeting required to be called as above provided shall not be called by the Secretary within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of Voting Preferred Shares may call such meeting, upon the notice above provided, and for that purpose shall have access to the stock books of the Corporation. The directors elected at any such special meeting shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders or special meeting held in lieu thereof if such office shall not have previously terminated as above provided. If any vacancy shall occur among the directors elected by the holders of the Voting Preferred Shares and the Arrearage Voting Preferred Shares, a successor shall be elected by the Board of Directors, upon the nomination of the then-remaining director elected by the holders of the Voting Preferred Shares and the Arrearage Voting Preferred Shares or the successor of such remaining director, to serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof if such office shall not have previously terminated as provided above. 

i) So long as any Voting Preferred Shares are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by law or by the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3 of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the Voting Preferred Shares voting as a single class with the holders of all other classes or series of shares ranking on a parity with the Voting Preferred Shares entitled to vote on such matters, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating:

convertible into shares of any class or series of shares ranking prior to the Voting Preferred Shares (whether or not such class or series of shares ranking prior to the Voting Preferred Shares is currently authorized); provided, however, that no such vote of the holders of Voting Preferred Shares shall be required if, at or prior to the time when such amendment, alteration or repeal is to take effect, or when the issuance of any such shares ranking prior to the Voting Preferred Shares or convertible or exchangeable security is to be made, as the case may be, provision is made for the redemption of all shares of Voting Preferred Shares at the time outstanding to the extent such redemption is authorized by Section 5. 

ii) In addition to the foregoing, the holders of Voting Preferred Shares shall be entitled to vote on all matters (for which holders of Common Shares shall be entitled to vote thereon) at all meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation, and shall be entitled to one vote for each Voting Preferred Share entitled to vote at such meeting. 

i) Record Holders . The Corporation and its transfer agent may deem and treat the record holder of any Voting Preferred Shares as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

ii. The Board of Directors, with a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel, may exempt a Person from the limitation on such Person Constructively Owning Common Shares in excess of the Related Party Limit if such Person does not own and represents that it will not own, directly or constructively (by virtue of the application of Section 318 of the Code, as modified by Section 856(d)(5) of the Code), more than a 9.9 interest (as set forth in Section 856(d)(2)(B)) in a tenant of any real property owned or leased by the Corporation, and the Corporation obtains such representations and undertakings from such Person as are reasonably necessary to ascertain this fact and agrees that any violation or attempted violation will result in such Common Shares in excess of 9.8 being transferred to a Trust in accordance with Section 4(c) of this Division B of this Article FOURTH. 

iii. The Board of Directors may exempt the Exempt Holder, and any Person who would Constructively Own Common Shares Constructively Owned by the Exempt Holder, from the limitation on the Exempt Holder (or such other Person who would Constructively Own Common Shares Constructively Owned by the Exempt Holder) Constructively Owning Common Shares in excess of the Related Party Limit in its sole discretion based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time of such proposed exemption and the information provided by the Exempt Holder, including, without limitation, information regarding a tenant of any real property owned or leased by the Corporation, of which tenant the Exempt Holder (or such other Person who would Constructively Own Common Shares Constructively Owned by the Exempt Holder) owns, directly or constructively (by virtue of the application of Section 318 of the Code, as modified by Section 856(d)(5) of the Code), more than a 9.9 interest (as set forth in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code).

Any Person who attempts to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Common Shares in excess of the above limitations must immediately notify the Corporation. All capitalized items in this legend have the meanings defined in the Corporation s Articles of Incorporation, a copy of which, including the restrictions on transfer, will be sent without charge to each shareholder who so requests. If the restrictions on transfer are violated, certain of the Common Shares represented hereby will be transferred automatically and by operation of law to a Trust and shall be designated Shares-in-Trust. 
 (6) Shares-in-Trust . 

i. Trust . Any Common Shares transferred to a Trust and designated Shares-in-Trust pursuant to Section 4(c) of Division B of this Article FOURTH shall be held for the exclusive benefit of the Beneficiary. The Corporation shall name a beneficiary of each Trust within five (5) days after discovery of the existence of such Shares-in-Trust. Any transfer to a Trust, and subsequent designation of Common Shares as Shares-in-Trust, pursuant to Section 4(c) of Division B of this Article FOURTH shall be effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of the Transfer or Non-Transfer Event that results in the transfer to the Trust. Shares-in-Trust shall remain issued and outstanding Common Shares and shall be entitled to the same rights and privileges on identical terms and conditions as are all other issued and outstanding Common Shares. When transferred to the Permitted Transferee in accordance with the provisions of Section 7(e) of Division B of this Article FOURTH, such Shares-in-Trust shall cease to be designated as Shares-in-Trust. 

ii. Dividend Rights . The Trustee, as record holder of Shares-in-Trust, shall be entitled to receive all dividends and distributions as may be declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation on such Common Shares and shall hold such dividends or distributions in trust for the benefit of the Beneficiary. The Prohibited Owner with respect to Shares-in-Trust shall repay to the Trustee the amount of any dividends or distributions received by it that (i) are attributable to any Common Shares designated as Shares-in-Trust and (ii) the record date of which was on or after the date that such Common Shares became Shares-in-Trust. The Corporation shall take all measures that it determines reasonably necessary to recover the amount of any such dividend or distribution paid to a Prohibited Owner, including, if necessary, withholding any portion of future dividends or distributions payable on Common Shares Beneficially Owned or Constructively Owned by the Person who, but for the provisions of Section 4(c) of Division B of this Article FOURTH, would Beneficially Own or Constructively Own the Shares-in-Trust; and, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Corporation s receipt or withholding thereof, shall pay over to the Trustee for the benefit of the Beneficiary the dividends so received or withheld, as the case may be. 

iii. Rights Upon Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of, or any distribution of the assets of, the Corporation, each holder of Shares-in-Trust shall be entitled to receive, ratably with each other holder of Common Shares, that portion of the assets of the Corporation which is available for distribution to the holders of Common Shares. The Trustee shall distribute to the Prohibited Owner the amounts received upon such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, or distribution; provided, however, that the Prohibited Owner shall not be entitled to receive amounts pursuant to this Section 7(c) of Division B of this Article FOURTH in excess of, in the case of a purported Transfer in which the Prohibited Owner gave value for Common Shares and which Transfer resulted in the transfer of the shares to the Trust, the price per share, if any, such Prohibited Owner paid for the Common Shares and, in the case of a Non-Transfer Event or Transfer in which the Prohibited Owner did not give value for such shares (e. g., if the shares were received through a gift or devise) and which Non-Transfer Event or Transfer, as the case may be, resulted in the transfer of shares to the Trust, the price per share equal to the Market Price on the date of such Non-Transfer Event or Transfer. Any remaining amount in such Trust shall be distributed to the Beneficiary. 

iv. Voting Rights . The Trustee shall be entitled to vote all Shares-in-Trust. Any vote by a Prohibited Owner as a holder of Common Shares prior to the discovery by the Corporation that the Common Shares are Shares-in-Trust shall, subject to applicable law, be rescinded and shall be void ab initio with respect to such Shares-in-Trust, and the Prohibited Owner shall be deemed to have given, as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of the purported Transfer or Non-Transfer Event that results in the transfer to the Trust of the Common Shares Section 4(c) of Division B of this Article FOURTH, an irrevocable proxy to the Trustee to vote the Shares-in-Trust in the manner in which the Trustee, in its sole and absolute discretion, desires. 

v. Designation of Permitted Transferee . The Trustee shall have the exclusive and absolute right to designate a Permitted Transferee of any and all Shares-in-Trust. As reasonably practicable as possible, in an orderly fashion so as not to materially adversely affect the Market Price of the Shares-in-Trust, the Trustee shall designate any Person as Permitted Transferee, provided, however, that (i) the Permitted Transferee so designated purchases for valuable consideration (whether in a public or private sale) the Shares-in-Trust and (ii) the Permitted Transferee so designated may acquire such Shares-in-Trust without such acquisition resulting in a transfer to a Trust and the redesignation of such Common Shares so acquired as Shares-in-Trust under Section 4(c) of Division B of this Article FOURTH. Upon the designation by the Trustee of a Permitted Transferee in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph, the Trustee of a Trust shall (i) cause to be transferred to the Permitted Transferee that number of Shares-in-Trust acquired by the Permitted Transferee, (ii) cause to be recorded on the books of the Corporation that the Permitted Transferee is the holder of record of such number of Common Shares, and (iii) distribute to the Beneficiary any and all amounts held with respect to the Shares-in-Trust after making that payment to the Prohibited Owner pursuant to Section 7(f) of Division B of this Article FOURTH. 

vi. Compensation to Record Holder of Common Shares that Become Shares-In-Trust . Any Prohibited Owner shall be entitled (following discovery of the Shares-In-Trust and subsequent designation of the Permitted Transferee in accordance with Section 4(e) of Division B of this Article FOURTH) to receive from the Trustee the lesser of (i) in the case of (A) a purported Transfer in which the Prohibited Owner gave value for Common Shares and which Transfer resulted in the transfer of the Common Shares to the Trust, the price per share, if any, such Prohibited Owner paid for the Common Shares, or (b) a Non-Transfer Event or Transfer in which the Prohibited Owner did not give value for such Common Shares (e. g., if the shares were received through a gift or devise) and which Non-Transfer Event or Transfer, as the case may be, resulted in the transfer of Common Shares to the Trust, the price per share equal to the Market Price on the date of such Non-Transfer Event or Transfer, and (ii) the price per share received by the Trustee of the Trust from the sale or other disposition of such Shares-in-Trust in accordance with Section 7(e) of Division B of this Article FOURTH. Any amounts received by the Trustee in respect of such Shares-in-Trust and in excess of such amounts to be paid the Prohibited Owner pursuant to this Section 7(f) of Division B of this Article FOURTH shall be distributed to the Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of Section 7(e) of Division B of this Article FOURTH. Each Beneficiary and Prohibited Owner waive any and all claims that they may have against the Trustee and the Corporation arising out of the disposition of Shares-in-Trust, except for claims arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or any failure to make payments in accordance with Section 7 of Division B of this Article FOURTH by, such Trustee or the Corporation. 

vii. Purchase Right in Shares-in-Trust . Shares-in-Trust shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the Corporation, or its designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created such Shares-in-Trust (or, in the case of devise, gift or Non-Transfer Event, the Market Price at the time of such devise, gift or Non-Transfer Event) and (ii) the Market Price on the date the Corporation, or its designee, accepts such offer. The Corporation shall have the right to accept such offer for a period of ninety days after the later of (i) the date of the Non-Transfer Event or purported Transfer which resulted in such Shares-in- Trust and (ii) the date the Corporation determines in good faith that a Transfer or Non-Transfer Event resulting in Shares-in-Trust has occurred, if the Corporation does not receive a notice of such Transfer or Non-Transfer Event pursuant to Section 4(e) of Division B of this Article FOURTH. Prompt payment of the purchase price shall be made in such reasonable manner as may be determined by the Corporation. 

FIFTH: At all times following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering (as defined in Article FOURTH), at least a majority of the members of the Board of Directors shall, except during the period of a vacancy or vacancies therein, be Independent Directors. An Independent Director shall mean a person who is not (i) employed by the Corporation or (ii) an affiliate (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) of (A) any entity which is part of the Developers Diversified Group, including, without limitation, Developers Diversified Limited Partnership, an Ohio limited partnership, Developers Diversified, Ltd., an Ohio limited partnership, W M Properties, an Ohio general partnership, W Z Properties, Ltd., an Ohio limited partnership, and DE Properties Corporation, an Ohio corporation, or (B) any partnership which is an affiliate (as defined above) of any entity listed in clause (A) of this Article FIFTH. 
 SIXTH: No holder of shares of the corporation of any class shall be entitled as such, as a matter of right, to subscribe for or purchase shares of any class, now or hereafter authorized, or to subscribe for or purchase securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the corporation or to which shall be attached or appertain any warrants or rights entitling the holder thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares, except such rights of subscription or purchase, if any, for such considerations and upon such terms and conditions as its Board of Directors from time to time may determine. 
 SEVENTH: Notwithstanding any provision of Section s 1701.01 to 1701.98, inclusive, of the Ohio Revised Code, or any successor statutes now or hereafter in force, requiring for the authorization or taking of any action the vote or consent of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise two-thirds or any other proportion of the voting power of the corporation or of any class or 

classes of shares thereof, such action, unless otherwise expressly required by law or these Articles of Incorporation, may be authorized or taken by the vote or consent of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power of the corporation or of such class or classes of shares thereof. 
 Except as provided in the Company s code of regulations with respect to the election of a director to fill a vacancy in the Board of Directors, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any shareholder meeting held for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; provided, however, that if as of the date that is ten days in advance of the date the Company files its definitive proxy statement (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to a shareholder meeting the number of nominees for election as a director is greater than the number of directors to be elected, then the directors shall be elected at the meeting by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at that meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means the number of shares voted for a director exceeds the number of votes cast against the director. Broker non-votes and abstentions will not be considered votes cast at the shareholder meeting and will be excluded in determining the number of votes cast at the shareholder meeting. 
 No holder of shares of the Company of any class shall have the right to cumulate the voting power of such shares in the election of directors. The right to cumulate the voting power as provided in Section 1701.55 of the Ohio Revised Code, or any successor statute now or hereinafter in force, is hereby specifically denied to all holders of shares of any class of the Company. 
 EIGHTH: To the extent permitted by law, the corporation, by action of its Board of Directors, may purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any class issued by it at such times, for such consideration and upon such terms and conditions as its Board of Directors may determine. 
 NINTH: The provisions of Chapter 1701.831 of the Ohio Revised Code shall not apply to the Corporation. 
 TENTH: The provisions of Chapter 1707.043 of the Ohio Revised Code shall not apply to the Corporation. 
 ELEVENTH: If any provision (or portion thereof) of these Articles of Incorporation shall be found to be invalid, prohibited, or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions (or portions thereof) of these Articles of Incorporation shall be deemed to remain in full force and effect, and shall be construed as if such invalid, prohibited, or unenforceable provision had been stricken herefrom or otherwise rendered inapplicable, it being the intent of the Corporation and its shareholders that each such remaining provision (or portion thereof) of these Articles of Incorporation remain, to the fullest extent permitted by law, applicable and enforceable as to all shareholders, notwithstanding any such finding. 
 TWELFTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in these Articles of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon shareholders herein are granted subject to this reservation. 
 THIRTEENTH: These Fourth Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation shall take the place of and supersede the Corporation s existing Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended.

 (v) If any action, proceeding, motion or notice shall be commenced or filed in respect of any lessor of all or any part of the Ground Leased Property in connection with any case under the Bankruptcy Code, Lender and Borrower shall cooperatively conduct and control any such litigation with counsel agreed upon between Borrower and Lender in connection with such litigation.

The Board of Directors of SITE Centers (the SITE Board ), on behalf of SITE Centers, and Executive desire to enter into this Agreement to reflect the terms pursuant to which Executive will continue to serve SITE Centers on and after the Effective Date (certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them in Section 22 of this Agreement). In addition, this Agreement takes into account certain considerations relating to SITE Centers proposed spin-off of Curbline Properties Corp., a Maryland corporation Curbline (such spin-off, the Spin-Off , and the date on which SITE Centers consummates such Spin-Off, the Spin-Off Date ). 
 SITE Centers and Executive agree, effective as of the Effective Date, as follows:

 1.2 Assignment of Agreement to Curbline . If the Spin-Off Date occurs prior to March 11, 2025, it is currently contemplated by the parties to this Agreement that this Agreement will be assigned to Curbline (or an appropriate Subsidiary) in connection with the Spin-Off, at which time Curbline (and/or an appropriate Subsidiary) will join SITE Centers as a counterparty to Executive in this Agreement. At that time, the 2020 Agreement will be superseded and replaced by such assigned Agreement, all as provided for in such assigned Agreement.

 9. Disability Definitions; Physical Examination . 
 9.1 Definitions . For all purposes of this Agreement: 
 (a) Executive s Own Occupation means the regular occupation in which Executive is engaged under this Agreement at the time Executive becomes disabled. 
 (b) Total Disability means that, because of sickness or injury, Executive is not able to perform the material and substantial duties of Executive s Own Occupation. 
 (c) Totally Disabled means that Executive suffers from Total Disability (and Executive will be deemed to continue to be Totally Disabled so long as Executive is not able to work in Executive s Own Occupation even if Executive works in some other capacity). 
 9.2 Physical Examination .

The amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement will not be reduced by any compensation or benefits earned by Executive as the result of employment by another employer or otherwise after the Termination Date. Neither the provisions of this Agreement nor the making of any payment provided for under this Agreement, nor the termination of any of SITE Centers or Curbline s obligations under this Agreement, will reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish Executive s rights, under any incentive compensation plan, stock option or stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or agreement, deferred compensation, retirement, or supplemental retirement plan, stock purchase and savings plan, disability or insurance plan, or other similar contract, plan, or arrangement of such entity or any subsidiary of such entity, all of which will be governed by their respective terms.

 12. Covenants and Confidential Information . Executive acknowledges each of SITE Centers and Curbline s reliance on and expectation of Executive s continued commitment to performance of Executive s duties and responsibilities during the Curbline Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline (or an appropriate Subsidiary) and Executive assumes the obligations set out in this Section 12 in light of that reliance and expectation on the part of such entities. 
 12.1 Noncompetition . During the Curbline Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline (or an appropriate Subsidiary), and for a period of 12 months thereafter, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, control, or participate in the ownership, management, or control of, or be employed or engaged by or otherwise affiliated or associated as a consultant, independent contractor, or otherwise with the entities that are originally part of Curbline s relative total shareholder return peer group, as most recently (but no later than as of the date of Executive's termination of employment) designated with respect to performance-based awards granted to Executive; provided , however , that the ownership by Executive of not more than three percent of any class of publicly traded securities of any entity will not be deemed a violation of this Section 12.1 (such restriction that applies post-employment, the Post-Termination Restriction ). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.1 to the contrary, if the inclusion of the Post-Termination Restriction in this Agreement becomes prohibited by the law applicable to this Agreement, then such Post-Termination Restriction shall be deemed inoperative and severed from this Agreement, with this Agreement further interpreted and operated as if such Post-Termination Restriction was not included in this Agreement as of the Effective Date. 
 12.2 Confidentiality . Throughout and after the Curbline Contract Period, Executive will not disclose, divulge, discuss, copy, or otherwise use or suffer to be used in any manner, in competition with, or contrary to the interests of, the Companies, any confidential information relating to the Companies operations, properties, or otherwise to their particular business or other trade secrets of the Companies, it being acknowledged by Executive that all such information regarding the business of the Companies compiled or obtained by, or furnished to, Executive during Executive s employment by or association with the Companies is confidential information and the Companies exclusive property, respectively. The restrictions in this Section 12.2 will not apply to any information to the extent that it (a) is clearly obtainable in the public domain, (b) becomes obtainable in the public domain, except by reason of the breach by Executive of Executive s obligations under this Section 12.2 , (c) was not acquired by Executive in connection with Executive s employment or affiliation with the Companies, (d) was not acquired by Executive from the Companies or their representatives, or (e) is required to be disclosed by rule of law or by order of a court or governmental body or agency.

 14 

12.3 Non-Disparagement . 
 (a) Throughout and after the Curbline Contract Period, outside the ordinary course of business on behalf of the Companies, Executive will not make or issue, or procure any person, firm, or entity to make or issue, any statement in any form, including written, oral and electronic communications of any kind, which conveys negative or adverse information concerning the Companies or their subsidiaries or affiliates, or any of their legal predecessors, successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries, divisions or other affiliates, or any of the foregoing s respective past, present or future directors, officers, employees or representatives (collectively, the Non-Disparagement Parties ), or any Non-Disparagement Party s business, or its actions, to any person or entity, regardless of the truth or falsity of such statement. 
 (b) Throughout and after the Curbline Contract Period, the Companies will each reasonably direct the executive officers and directors of such Company not to make or issue, or procure any person, firm, or entity to make or issue, any statement in any form, including written, oral and electronic communications of any kind, which conveys negative or adverse information concerning Executive or any of Executive s legal successors, assigns, or other affiliates, or any of the foregoing s respective past, present or future directors, officers, employees or representatives (collectively, the Executive Non-Disparagement Parties ), or any Executive Non-Disparagement Party s business, or its actions, to any person or entity, regardless of the truth or falsity of such statement.

Such requirement shall not apply to Executive during the Curbline Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline (or an appropriate Subsidiary) with respect to any employee of SITE Centers as permitted by the Employee Matters Agreement. 
 12.5 Remedies . Executive acknowledges that the remedy at law for any breach by Executive of this Section 12 may be inadequate and that the damages following from any such breach may not be readily susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, Executive agrees that, upon adequate proof of Executive s violation of any legally enforceable provision of this Section 12 , the Companies will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach. Nothing in this Section 12 will be deemed to limit the Companies remedies at law or in equity for any breach by Executive of any of the provisions of this Section 12 that may be pursued or availed of by the Companies. 
 12.6 Acknowledgement . Executive has carefully considered the nature and extent of the restrictions upon Executive and the rights and remedies conferred upon the Companies under this Section 12 , and hereby acknowledges and agrees that the same are reasonable in time and territory, are designed to eliminate competition that otherwise would be unfair to the Companies, 
 15 

do not stifle the inherent skill and experience of Executive, would not operate as a bar to Executive s sole means of support, are fully required to protect the legitimate interests of the Companies, and do not confer a benefit upon the Companies disproportionate to the detriment to Executive. 
 13. Compliance with Section 409A . 
 13.1 Six Month Delay on Certain Payments, Benefits, and Reimbursements . If Executive is a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A (as determined under Curbline s policy for determining specified employees on the Termination Date), to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), each payment, benefit, or reimbursement paid or provided under this Agreement that constitutes a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, that is to be paid or provided as a result of a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, and that would otherwise be paid or provided at any time (a Scheduled Time that is on or before the date (the Six Month Date that is exactly six months after the Termination Date (other than payments, benefits, or reimbursements that are treated as separation pay under Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury Regulations) will not be paid or provided at the Scheduled Time but will be accumulated (together with interest at the applicable federal rate under Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code in effect on the Termination Date) through the Six Month Date and paid or provided during the period of 30 consecutive days beginning on the first business day after the Six Month Date (that period of 30 consecutive days, the Seventh Month after the Termination Date ), except that if Executive dies before the Six Month Date, the payments, benefits, or reimbursements will be accumulated only through the date of Executive s death and thereafter paid or provided not later than 30 days after the date of death. 
 13.2 Additional Limitations on Reimbursements and In-Kind Benefits . The reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits provided under Section 7 or under any other section of this Agreement that are taxable benefits (and that are not disability pay or death benefit plans within the meaning of Section 409A) are intended to comply, to the maximum extent possible, with the exception to Section 409A set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury Regulations. To the extent that any reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits provided under Section 7 or under any other section of this Agreement do not qualify for that exception and are otherwise deferred compensation subject to Section 409A , then they will be subject to the following additional rules: (i) any reimbursement of eligible expenses will be paid within 30 days following Executive s written request for reimbursement; provided , however , that Executive provides written notice no later than 60 days before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred so that the reimbursement can be made within the time periods required by Section 409A; (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, during any other calendar year; and (iii) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 
 13.3 Compliance Generally . Each payment or reimbursement and the provision of each benefit under this Agreement shall be considered a separate payment and not one of a series of payments for purposes of Section 409A. The Companies and Executive intend that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement will either be exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A. This Agreement is to be construed, administered, and governed in a manner that effects that intent and the Companies will not take any action that is 
 16 

inconsistent with that intent. Without limiting the foregoing, the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement may not be deferred, accelerated, extended, paid out, or modified in a manner that would result in the imposition of an additional tax under Section 409A upon Executive. Notwithstanding any provision of Section 7 to the contrary, if the period commencing on the Termination Date begins in one taxable year of Executive and the 74th day following the Termination Date is in a subsequent taxable year, any amounts payable under Section 7 which are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A shall be paid in such subsequent taxable year. 
 13.4 Termination of Employment to Constitute a Separation from Service . The parties hereto intend that the phrase termination of employment and words and phrases of similar import mean a separation from service with Curbline (or an appropriate Subsidiary) within the meaning of Section 409A. Executive and the Companies will take all steps necessary (including taking into account this Section 13.4 when considering any further agreement regarding provision of services by Executive to Curbline after the Termination Date) to ensure that (a) any termination of employment under this Agreement constitutes a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, and (b) the Termination Date is the date on which Executive experiences a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. 
 14. Indemnification . Curbline will indemnify Executive, to the full extent permitted or authorized by the Maryland General Corporation Law as it may from time to time be amended, if Executive is made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that Executive is or was a director, officer, or employee of Curbline and/or of any Subsidiary, or is or was serving at the request of Curbline and/or of any Subsidiary as a director, trustee, officer, or employee of a corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. The indemnification provided by this Section 14 will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Executive may be entitled under the articles of incorporation or the regulations of Curbline and/or of any Subsidiary, or any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in Executive s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and will continue as to Executive after Executive has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, or employee and will inure to the benefit of Executive s heirs, executors, and administrators. In particular, Executive will continue to be entitled to the full benefit of the indemnification agreement then in effect between Executive and Curbline (the Indemnification Agreement for so long as that Indemnification Agreement remains in effect according to its terms. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Section 14 and the provisions of the Indemnification Agreement, the provisions of the Indemnification Agreement shall control. 
 15. Adjustment of Certain Payments and Benefits . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any payment or benefit to be paid or provided hereunder or under any other plan or agreement would be an Excess Parachute Payment, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor provision thereto, but for the application of this sentence, then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided hereunder shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment; provided , however , that the foregoing reduction shall be made only if and to the extent that such reduction would result in an increase in the aggregate payments and benefits to be provided, determined on an after-tax basis (taking into account the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law, and any applicable federal, state and local income taxes). The determination of whether any reduction in such payments or benefits to be provided hereunder 
 17 

is required pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made at the expense of Curbline, if requested by Executive or Curbline, by Curbline s independent accountants or a nationally recognized law firm chosen by Curbline. The fact that Executive s right to payments or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this Section 15 shall not of itself limit or otherwise affect any other rights of Executive under this Agreement. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided hereunder is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section 15 , then the reduction will be made in accordance with Section 409A and will occur in the following order: (a) first, by reducing any cash payments with the last scheduled payment reduced first; (b) second, by reducing any equity-based benefits that are included at full value under Q A-24(a) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (the 280G Regulations ), with the highest value reduced first; (c) third, by reducing any equity-based benefits included on an acceleration value under Q A-24(b) or 24(c) of the 280G Regulations, with the highest value reduced first; and (d) fourth, by reducing any non-cash, non-equity based benefits, with the latest scheduled benefit reduced first.

Each of Curbline and SITE Centers obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations under this Agreement will not be affected by any set off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other claim whatsoever that such entity or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entity may have against Executive, except that the prohibition on set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other claim contained in this sentence will not apply if Executive s employment is terminated by such entity for Cause. Executive will not be required to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise. The amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement will not be reduced by any compensation or benefits earned by Executive as the result of employment by another employer or otherwise after the Termination Date. Neither the provisions of this Agreement nor the making of any payment provided for under this Agreement, nor the termination of any of SITE Centers or Curbline s obligations under this Agreement, will reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish Executive s rights, under any incentive compensation plan, stock option or stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or agreement, deferred compensation, retirement, or supplemental retirement plan, stock purchase and savings plan, disability or insurance plan, or other similar contract, plan, or arrangement of such entity or any subsidiary of such entity, all of which will be governed by their respective terms. 

11. Payments Are in Lieu of Severance Payments . If Executive becomes entitled to receive payments under this Agreement as a result of termination of Executive s employment, those payments will be in lieu of any and all other claims or rights that Executive may have against SITE Centers, Curbline and/or Curbline TRS for severance, separation, and/or salary continuation pay upon that termination of Executive s employment. 

12. Covenants and Confidential Information . Executive acknowledges each of SITE Centers and Curbline s reliance on and expectation of Executive s continued commitment to performance of Executive s duties and responsibilities during the Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline TRS and Executive assumes the obligations set out in this Section 12 in light of that reliance and expectation on the part of such entities. 

12.1 Noncompetition . During the Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline TRS, and for a period of 12 months thereafter, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, own, 

14 

manage, control, or participate in the ownership, management, or control of, or be employed or engaged by or otherwise affiliated or associated as a consultant, independent contractor, or otherwise with the entities that are originally part of Curbline s relative total shareholder return peer group, as most recently (but no later than as of the date of Executive s termination of employment) designated with respect to performance-based awards granted to Executive; provided , however , that the ownership by Executive of not more than three percent of any class of publicly traded securities of any entity will not be deemed a violation of this Section 12.1 (such restriction that applies post-employment, the Post-Termination Restriction ). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.1 to the contrary, if the inclusion of the Post-Termination Restriction in this Agreement becomes prohibited by the law applicable to this Agreement, then such Post-Termination Restriction shall be deemed inoperative and severed from this Agreement, with this Agreement further interpreted and operated as if such Post-Termination Restriction was not included in this Agreement as of the Effective Date. 

12.2 Confidentiality . Throughout and after the Contract Period, Executive will not disclose, divulge, discuss, copy, or otherwise use or suffer to be used in any manner, in competition with, or contrary to the interests of, the Companies, any confidential information relating to the Companies operations, properties, or otherwise to their particular business or other trade secrets of the Companies, it being acknowledged by Executive that all such information regarding the business of the Companies compiled or obtained by, or furnished to, Executive during Executive s employment by or association with the Companies is confidential information and the Companies exclusive property, respectively. The restrictions in this Section 12.2 will not apply to any information to the extent that it (a) is clearly obtainable in the public domain, (b) becomes obtainable in the public domain, except by reason of the breach by Executive of Executive s obligations under this Section 12.2 , (c) was not acquired by Executive in connection with Executive s employment or affiliation with the Companies, (d) was not acquired by Executive from the Companies or their representatives, or (e) is required to be disclosed by rule of law or by order of a court or governmental body or agency. However, nothing in this Agreement or in ancillary agreements is intended to interfere with or discourage the disclosure of a suspected violation of the law to any governmental entity, or to discourage Executive from participating in an investigation by a governmental entity regarding a suspected violation of the law. 

12.3 Non-Disparagement . 

(a) Throughout and after the Contract Period, outside the ordinary course of business on behalf of the Companies, Executive will not make or issue, or procure any person, firm, or entity to make or issue, any statement in any form, including written, oral and electronic communications of any kind, which conveys negative or adverse information concerning the Companies or their subsidiaries or affiliates, or any of their legal predecessors, successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries, divisions or other affiliates, or any of the foregoing s respective past, present or future directors, officers, employees or representatives (collectively, the Non-Disparagement Parties ), or any Non-Disparagement Party s business, or its actions, to any person or entity, regardless of the truth or falsity of such statement. 

(b) Throughout and after the Contract Period, the Companies will each reasonably direct the executive officers and directors of such Company not to make or issue, or 

15 

procure any person, firm, or entity to make or issue, any statement in any form, including written, oral and electronic communications of any kind, which conveys negative or adverse information concerning Executive or any of Executive s legal successors, assigns, or other affiliates, or any of the foregoing s respective past, present or future directors, officers, employees or representatives (collectively, the Executive Non-Disparagement Parties ), or any Executive Non-Disparagement Party s business, or its actions, to any person or entity, regardless of the truth or falsity of such statement. 

(c) This Section 12.3 does not apply to truthful testimony or disclosure compelled or required by applicable law or legal process. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or ancillary agreements to the contrary, Executive is not prohibited from providing information voluntarily to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

12.4 Nonsolicitation . During the Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline TRS, and for a period of 12 months thereafter, Executive will not directly or indirectly solicit or induce or attempt to solicit or induce any employee of the Companies and/or of any of their subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her employment with the Companies and/or any of their subsidiaries. Such requirement shall not apply to Executive during the Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline TRS with respect to any employee of SITE Centers as permitted by the Employee Matters Agreement. 

12.5 Remedies . Executive acknowledges that the remedy at law for any breach by Executive of this Section 12 may be inadequate and that the damages following from any such breach may not be readily susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, Executive agrees that, upon adequate proof of Executive s violation of any legally enforceable provision of this Section 12 , the Companies will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach. Nothing in this Section 12 will be deemed to limit the Companies remedies at law or in equity for any breach by Executive of any of the provisions of this Section 12 that may be pursued or availed of by the Companies. 

12.6 Acknowledgement . Executive has carefully considered the nature and extent of the restrictions upon Executive and the rights and remedies conferred upon the Companies under this Section 12 , and hereby acknowledges and agrees that the same are reasonable in time and territory, are designed to eliminate competition that otherwise would be unfair to the Companies, do not stifle the inherent skill and experience of Executive, would not operate as a bar to Executive s sole means of support, are fully required to protect the legitimate interests of the Companies, and do not confer a benefit upon the Companies disproportionate to the detriment to Executive. 

13. Compliance with Section 409A . 

13.1 Six Month Delay on Certain Payments, Benefits, and Reimbursements . If Executive is a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A (as determined under Curbline s policy for determining specified employees on the Termination Date), to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), each payment, benefit, or reimbursement paid or provided under this Agreement that constitutes a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, that is to be paid or provided as a result of a separation from service within the meaning of 

16 

Section 409A, and that would otherwise be paid or provided at any time (a Scheduled Time that is on or before the date (the Six Month Date that is exactly six months after the Termination Date (other than payments, benefits, or reimbursements that are treated as separation pay under Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury Regulations) will not be paid or provided at the Scheduled Time but will be accumulated (together with interest at the applicable federal rate under Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code in effect on the Termination Date) through the Six Month Date and paid or provided during the period of 30 consecutive days beginning on the first business day after the Six Month Date (that period of 30 consecutive days, the Seventh Month after the Termination Date ), except that if Executive dies before the Six Month Date, the payments, benefits, or reimbursements will be accumulated only through the date of Executive s death and thereafter paid or provided not later than 30 days after the date of death. 

13.2 Additional Limitations on Reimbursements and In-Kind Benefits . The reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits provided under Section 7 or under any other section of this Agreement that are taxable benefits (and that are not disability pay or death benefit plans within the meaning of Section 409A) are intended to comply, to the maximum extent possible, with the exception to Section 409A set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury Regulations. To the extent that any reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits provided under Section 7 or under any other section of this Agreement do not qualify for that exception and are otherwise deferred compensation subject to Section 409A , then they will be subject to the following additional rules: (i) any reimbursement of eligible expenses will be paid within 30 days following Executive s written request for reimbursement; provided , however , that Executive provides written notice no later than 60 days before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred so that the reimbursement can be made within the time periods required by Section 409A; (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, during any other calendar year; and (iii) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 

13.3 Compliance Generally . Each payment or reimbursement and the provision of each benefit under this Agreement shall be considered a separate payment and not one of a series of payments for purposes of Section 409A. The Companies and Executive intend that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement will either be exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A. This Agreement is to be construed, administered, and governed in a manner that effects that intent and the Companies will not take any action that is inconsistent with that intent. Without limiting the foregoing, the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement may not be deferred, accelerated, extended, paid out, or modified in a manner that would result in the imposition of an additional tax under Section 409A upon Executive. Notwithstanding any provision of Section 7 to the contrary, if the period commencing on the Termination Date begins in one taxable year of Executive and the 74th day following the Termination Date is in a subsequent taxable year, any amounts payable under Section 7 which are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A shall be paid in such subsequent taxable year. 

13.4 Termination of Employment to Constitute a Separation from Service . The parties hereto intend that the phrase termination of employment and words and phrases of similar import 

17 

mean a separation from service with Curbline TRS within the meaning of Section 409A. Executive and the Companies will take all steps necessary (including taking into account this Section 13.4 when considering any further agreement regarding provision of services by Executive to Curbline after the Termination Date) to ensure that (a) any termination of employment under this Agreement constitutes a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, and (b) the Termination Date is the date on which Executive experiences a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. 

14. Indemnification . Curbline will indemnify Executive, to the full extent permitted or authorized by the Maryland General Corporation Law as it may from time to time be amended, if Executive is made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that Executive is or was a director, officer, or employee of Curbline and/or of any Subsidiary, or is or was serving at the request of Curbline and/or of any Subsidiary as a director, trustee, officer, or employee of a corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. The indemnification provided by this Section 14 will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Executive may be entitled under the articles of incorporation or the regulations of Curbline and/or of any Subsidiary, or any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in Executive s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and will continue as to Executive after Executive has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, or employee and will inure to the benefit of Executive s heirs, executors, and administrators. In particular, Executive will continue to be entitled to the full benefit of the indemnification agreement then in effect between Executive and Curbline (the Indemnification Agreement for so long as that Indemnification Agreement remains in effect according to its terms. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Section 14 and the provisions of the Indemnification Agreement, the provisions of the Indemnification Agreement shall control. 

15. Adjustment of Certain Payments and Benefits . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any payment or benefit to be paid or provided hereunder or under any other plan or agreement would be an Excess Parachute Payment, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor provision thereto, but for the application of this sentence, then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided hereunder shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment; provided , however , that the foregoing reduction shall be made only if and to the extent that such reduction would result in an increase in the aggregate payments and benefits to be provided, determined on an after-tax basis (taking into account the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law, and any applicable federal, state and local income taxes). The determination of whether any reduction in such payments or benefits to be provided hereunder is required pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made at the expense of Curbline, if requested by Executive or Curbline, by Curbline s independent accountants or a nationally recognized law firm chosen by Curbline. The fact that Executive s right to payments or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this Section 15 shall not of itself limit or otherwise affect any other rights of Executive under this Agreement. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided hereunder is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section 15 , then the reduction will be made in accordance with Section 409A and will occur in the following order: (a) first, by reducing any cash payments with the last scheduled payment reduced first; (b) second, by reducing any equity-based benefits that are included at full value under Q A-24(a) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under 

18 

Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (the 280G Regulations ), with the highest value reduced first; (c) third, by reducing any equity-based benefits included on an acceleration value under Q A-24(b) or 24(c) of the 280G Regulations, with the highest value reduced first; and (d) fourth, by reducing any non-cash, non-equity based benefits, with the latest scheduled benefit reduced first. 

16. Certain Expenses . This Section 16 will apply only to expenses that (a) are otherwise described in one or more of its subsections and (b) are incurred at any time from the Effective Date through the fifth anniversary of Executive s death. 

16.1 Reimbursement of Certain Expenses . Each applicable Company (or Curbline TRS) will pay, as incurred, all expenses, including the reasonable fees of counsel engaged by Executive, of Executive in (a) prosecuting any action to compel such Company (including Curbline, on behalf of Curbline TRS) to comply with the terms of this Agreement upon receipt from Executive of an undertaking to repay such Company for such expenses if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that Executive had no reasonable grounds for bringing such action or (b) defending any action brought by a party other than Executive or Executive s personal representative to have this Agreement declared invalid or unenforceable. 

16.2 Advancement of Certain Expenses . Expenses (including the reasonable fees of counsel engaged by Executive) incurred by Executive in defending any action, suit, or proceeding commenced or threatened against Executive for any action or failure to act as an employee, officer or director of one of the Companies and/or of any of its subsidiaries will be paid by such Company, as they are incurred, in advance of final disposition of the action, suit, or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of Executive in which Executive agrees to reasonably cooperate with such Company and/or such subsidiary, as the case may be, concerning the action, suit, or proceeding, and (a) if the action, suit, or proceeding is commenced or threatened against Executive for any action or failure to act as a director, to repay the amount if it is proved by clear and convincing evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction that his action or failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to cause injury to such Company or one of its subsidiaries or with reckless disregard for the best interests of such Company or one of its subsidiaries, or (b) if the action, suit, or proceeding is commenced or threatened against Executive for any action or failure to act as an officer or employee, to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined that Executive is not entitled to be indemnified. The obligation of each such Company to advance expenses provided for in this Section 16.2 will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Executive may be entitled under the articles/certificate of incorporation or the regulations/bylaws of such Company or of any of its subsidiaries, or any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. 

17. Survival of Obligations . Except as is otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the respective obligations of each of the Companies (and Curbline TRS) and Executive under this Agreement will survive any termination of Executive s employment under this Agreement.

19. Entire Agreement . Except as otherwise set forth below in this Section 19 or as otherwise described herein, this Agreement and the agreements specifically referenced herein supersede in their entirety all prior agreements between the parties, if any, and all understandings between them, if any, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, including the Employment Agreement, dated as of March 2, 2017, and the 2020 Agreement, in each case between SITE Centers and Executive. As provided in Section 14 , Executive will continue to be entitled to the full benefit of the Indemnification Agreement for so long as it remains in effect according to its terms. For purposes of clarification, notwithstanding anything in the 2020 Agreement, the 2024 Agreement and/or this Agreement to the contrary, there shall be no duplication of compensation and benefits under the 2020 Agreement, the 2024 Agreement and this Agreement. 

20. Mandatory Arbitration Before a Change in Control . Section 20.1 will apply if and only if a party to this Agreement notifies another party to this Agreement, in writing, that it is demanding resolution of a then-current controversy or claim by arbitration and the notice is provided by the notifying party to such other party before any Change in Control has occurred. Nothing in this Section 20 will limit the right of each of the Companies to seek and obtain injunctive relief in a court of equity for any breach or threatened breach by Executive of any of Executive s covenants contained in Section 12 above. 

20.1 Scope of Arbitration . If this Section 20.1 applies, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any breach of this Agreement will be settled by binding arbitration to be held before three arbitrators and conducted in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association in the City of Cleveland, Ohio or New York, New York. The decision of the arbitrators will be final and binding on such parties and judgment on any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Costs and expenses of any such arbitration will be borne by the parties as may be directed by the arbitrators taking into account the extent to which the positions taken by such parties are reasonable. The arbitrators will have the power to issue mandatory orders and restraining orders in connection with any such arbitration. 

20.2 Other Disputes . If Section 20.1 does not apply to any claim or controversy between such parties, such parties may nevertheless, but need not, mutually agree to submit any controversy or claim to arbitration as though Section 20.1 did apply. Failing any such mutual agreement, either of such parties may bring proceedings against the other with respect to any claim or controversy in any court of competent jurisdiction that satisfies the venue requirements set forth in Section 21.8 . Nothing in this Section 20.2 imposes upon either of such parties any obligation to discuss possible arbitration of any claim or controversy to which Section 20.1 does not apply before bringing any court proceedings with respect to that claim or controversy. 

21. Miscellaneous . 

21.1 No Conflict . Executive represents and warrants that Executive is not a party to any agreement, contract, or understanding, whether employment or otherwise, that would restrict or 

20 

prohibit Executive from undertaking or performing employment in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

21.3 Severability .

21.4 Benefit of Agreement . The rights and obligations of SITE Centers, Curbline TRS and Curbline, respectively, under this Agreement will inure to the benefit of, and will be binding on, SITE Centers, Curbline TRS and Curbline, respectively, and each of its successors and assigns, as applicable, and the rights and obligations (other than obligations to perform services) of Executive under this Agreement will inure to the benefit of, and will be binding upon, Executive and Executive s heirs, personal representatives, and assigns. 

21.5 No Waiver . The failure of any party to enforce any provision or provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions as to any future violations thereof, nor prevent that party from later enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement. The rights granted the parties in this Agreement are cumulative and the waiver of any single remedy will not constitute a waiver of that party s right to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances. 

21.6 Modification . This Agreement may not be modified or terminated orally. No modification or termination will be valid unless in writing and signed by the parties against which the modification or termination is sought to be enforced.

Further, Executive agrees to fully cooperate with each of the Companies in connection with any of Executive s obligations to such Company pursuant to the Compensation Recovery Policy, and agrees that such Company may enforce its rights under the Compensation Recovery Policy through any and all reasonable means permitted under applicable 

21 

law as it deems necessary or desirable under the Compensation Recovery Policy, in each case from and after the effective dates thereof.

During the Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline TRS, Curbline will not consolidate with or merge into any other corporation, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets to another corporation, unless such other corporation assumes this Agreement in a signed writing and delivers a copy thereof to Executive, which signed writing may consist of the merger or sale agreement, or similar document. Upon any such assumption, the successor corporation will become obligated to perform the obligations of Curbline and Curbline TRS under this Agreement, and the term Curbline, as used in this Agreement, will be deemed to refer to that successor corporation, and the term Curbline Board as used in this Agreement will be deemed to refer to the board of directors of that successor corporation. 

21.8 Governing Law and Venue .

(b) Total Disability means that, because of sickness or injury, Executive is not able to perform the material and substantial duties of Executive s Own Occupation. 

(c) Totally Disabled means that Executive suffers from Total Disability (and Executive will be deemed to continue to be Totally Disabled so long as Executive is not able to work in Executive s Own Occupation even if Executive works in some other capacity). 

9.2. Physical Examination . If either Curbline or Executive, at any time or from time to time after receipt of notice of Executive s Total Disability from the other, desires to contend that Executive is not Totally Disabled, Executive will promptly submit to a physical examination by the chief of medicine of any major accredited hospital in the New York, New York or Cleveland, Ohio areas (at Curbline s reasonable cost) and, unless that physician issues his or her written statement to the effect that, in his or her opinion, based on his or her diagnosis, Executive is capable of resuming Executive s Own Occupation and discharging the duties of Executive s Own Occupation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Executive will be deemed to be and to continue to be Totally Disabled for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.2 , to the extent that Executive s employment with Curbline TRS terminates during the Remaining SITE Service Period and this Section 9.2 is applicable, then references in this Section 9.2 to Curbline will be deemed references to SITE Centers . 

10. No Set Off; No Obligation to Seek Other Employment or to Otherwise Mitigate Damages; No Effect Upon Other Plans . Each of Curbline and SITE Centers obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations under this Agreement will not be affected by any set off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other claim whatsoever that such entity or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entity may have against Executive, except that the prohibition on set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other claim contained in this sentence will not apply if Executive s employment is terminated by such entity for Cause. Executive will not be required to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise. The amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement will not be reduced by any compensation or benefits earned by Executive as the result of employment by another employer or otherwise after the Termination Date. Neither the provisions of this Agreement nor the making of any payment provided for under this Agreement, nor the termination of any of SITE Centers or Curbline s obligations under this Agreement, will reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish Executive s rights, under any incentive compensation plan, stock option or stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or agreement, deferred compensation, retirement, or supplemental retirement plan, stock purchase and savings plan, disability or insurance plan, or other similar contract, plan, or arrangement of such entity or any subsidiary of such entity, all of which will be governed by their respective terms. 

10 

11. Payments Are in Lieu of Severance Payments . If Executive becomes entitled to receive payments under this Agreement as a result of termination of Executive s employment, those payments will be in lieu of any and all other claims or rights that Executive may have against SITE Centers, Curbline and/or Curbline TRS for severance, separation, and/or salary continuation pay upon that termination of Executive s employment. 

12. Covenants and Confidential Information . Executive acknowledges each of SITE Centers and Curbline s reliance on and expectation of Executive s continued commitment to performance of Executive s duties and responsibilities during the Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline TRS and Executive assumes the obligations set out in this Section 12 in light of that reliance and expectation on the part of such entities. 

12.1. Noncompetition . During the Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline TRS, and for a period of 12 months thereafter, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, control, or participate in the ownership, management, or control of, or be employed or engaged by or otherwise affiliated or associated as a consultant, independent contractor, or otherwise with the entities that are originally part of Curbline s relative total shareholder return peer group, as most recently (but no later than as of the date of Executive s termination of employment) designated with respect to performance-based awards granted to Executive; provided , however , that the ownership by Executive of not more than three percent of any class of publicly traded securities of any entity will not be deemed a violation of this Section 12.1 (such restriction that applies post-employment, the Post-Termination Restriction ). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.1 to the contrary, if the inclusion of the Post-Termination Restriction in this Agreement becomes prohibited by the law applicable to this Agreement, then such Post-Termination Restriction shall be deemed inoperative and severed from this Agreement, with this Agreement further interpreted and operated as if such Post-Termination Restriction was not included in this Agreement as of the Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 12.1 , to the extent that Executive s employment with Curbline TRS terminates during the Remaining SITE Service Period, then references in this Section 12.1 to Curbline will be deemed references to SITE Centers . 

12.2. Confidentiality . Throughout and after the Contract Period, Executive will not disclose, divulge, discuss, copy, or otherwise use or suffer to be used in any manner, in competition with, or contrary to the interests of, the Companies, any confidential information relating to the Companies operations, properties, or otherwise to their particular business or other trade secrets of the Companies, it being acknowledged by Executive that all such information regarding the business of the Companies compiled or obtained by, or furnished to, Executive during Executive s employment by or association with the Companies is confidential information and the Companies exclusive property, respectively. The restrictions in this Section 12.2 will not apply to any information to the extent that it (a) is clearly obtainable in the public domain, (b) becomes obtainable in the public domain, except by reason of the breach by Executive of Executive s obligations under this Section 12.2 , (c) was not acquired by Executive in connection with Executive s employment or affiliation with the Companies, (d) was not acquired by Executive from the Companies or their representatives, or (e) is required to be disclosed by rule of law or by order of a court or governmental body or agency.

12.3. Non-Disparagement . 

(a) Throughout and after the Contract Period, outside the ordinary course of business on behalf of the Companies, Executive will not make or issue, or procure any person, firm, or entity to make or issue, any statement in any form, including written, oral and electronic communications of any kind, which conveys negative or adverse information concerning the Companies or their subsidiaries or affiliates, or any of their legal predecessors, successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries, divisions or other affiliates, or any of the foregoing s respective past, present or future directors, officers, employees or representatives (collectively, the Non-Disparagement Parties ), or any Non-Disparagement Party s business, or its actions, to any person or entity, regardless of the truth or falsity of such statement. 

(b) Throughout and after the Contract Period, the Companies will each reasonably direct the executive officers and directors of such Company not to make or issue, or procure any person, 

11 

firm, or entity to make or issue, any statement in any form, including written, oral and electronic communications of any kind, which conveys negative or adverse information concerning Executive or any of Executive s legal successors, assigns, or other affiliates, or any of the foregoing s respective past, present or future directors, officers, employees or representatives (collectively, the Executive Non-Disparagement Parties ), or any Executive Non-Disparagement Party s business, or its actions, to any person or entity, regardless of the truth or falsity of such statement.

Such requirement shall not apply to Executive during the Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline TRS with respect to any employee of SITE Centers as permitted by the Employee Matters Agreement. 

12.5. Remedies . Executive acknowledges that the remedy at law for any breach by Executive of this Section 12 may be inadequate and that the damages following from any such breach may not be readily susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, Executive agrees that, upon adequate proof of Executive s violation of any legally enforceable provision of this Section 12 , the Companies will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach. Nothing in this Section 12 will be deemed to limit the Companies remedies at law or in equity for any breach by Executive of any of the provisions of this Section 12 that may be pursued or availed of by the Companies. 

12.6. Acknowledgement . Executive has carefully considered the nature and extent of the restrictions upon Executive and the rights and remedies conferred upon the Companies under this Section 12 , and hereby acknowledges and agrees that the same are reasonable in time and territory, are designed to eliminate competition that otherwise would be unfair to the Companies, do not stifle the inherent skill and experience of Executive, would not operate as a bar to Executive s sole means of support, are fully required to protect the legitimate interests of the Companies, and do not confer a benefit upon the Companies disproportionate to the detriment to Executive. 

13. Compliance with Section 409A . 

13.1. Six Month Delay on Certain Payments, Benefits, and Reimbursements . If Executive is a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A (as determined under Curbline s policy for determining specified employees on the Termination Date), to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), each payment, benefit, or reimbursement paid or provided under this Agreement that constitutes a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, that is to be paid or provided as a result of a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, and that would otherwise be paid or provided at any time (a Scheduled Time that is on or before the date (the Six Month Date that is exactly six months after the Termination Date (other than payments, benefits, or reimbursements that are treated as separation pay under Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury Regulations) will not be paid or provided at the Scheduled Time but will be accumulated (together with interest at the applicable federal rate under Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code in effect on the Termination Date) through the Six Month Date and paid or provided during the period of 30 consecutive days beginning on the first business day after the Six Month Date (that period of 30 consecutive days, the Seventh Month after the Termination Date ), except that if Executive dies before the Six Month Date, the payments, benefits, or reimbursements will be accumulated only through the date of Executive s death and thereafter paid or provided not later than 30 days after the date of death. 

13.2. Additional Limitations on Reimbursements and In-Kind Benefits . The reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits provided under Section 7 or under any other section of this Agreement that are taxable 

12 

benefits (and that are not disability pay or death benefit plans within the meaning of Section 409A) are intended to comply, to the maximum extent possible, with the exception to Section 409A set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury Regulations. To the extent that any reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits provided under Section 7 or under any other section of this Agreement do not qualify for that exception and are otherwise deferred compensation subject to Section 409A , then they will be subject to the following additional rules: (i) any reimbursement of eligible expenses will be paid within 30 days following Executive s written request for reimbursement; provided , however , that Executive provides written notice no later than 60 days before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred so that the reimbursement can be made within the time periods required by Section 409A; (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, during any other calendar year; and (iii) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 

13.3. Compliance Generally . Each payment or reimbursement and the provision of each benefit under this Agreement shall be considered a separate payment and not one of a series of payments for purposes of Section 409A. The Companies and Executive intend that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement will either be exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A. This Agreement is to be construed, administered, and governed in a manner that effects that intent and the Companies will not take any action that is inconsistent with that intent. Without limiting the foregoing, the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement may not be deferred, accelerated, extended, paid out, or modified in a manner that would result in the imposition of an additional tax under Section 409A upon Executive. Notwithstanding any provision of Section 7 to the contrary, if the period commencing on the Termination Date begins in one taxable year of Executive and the 74th day following the Termination Date is in a subsequent taxable year, any amounts payable under Section 7 which are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A shall be paid in such subsequent taxable year. 

13.4. Termination of Employment to Constitute a Separation from Service . The parties hereto intend that the phrase termination of employment and words and phrases of similar import mean a separation from service with Curbline TRS within the meaning of Section 409A. Executive and the Companies will take all steps necessary (including taking into account this Section 13.4 when considering any further agreement regarding provision of services by Executive to Curbline after the Termination Date) to ensure that (a) any termination of employment under this Agreement constitutes a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, and (b) the Termination Date is the date on which Executive experiences a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. 

14. Indemnification . Curbline will indemnify Executive, to the full extent permitted or authorized by the Maryland General Corporation Law as it may from time to time be amended, if Executive is made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that Executive is or was a director, officer, or employee of Curbline and/or of any Subsidiary, or is or was serving at the request of Curbline and/or of any Subsidiary as a director, trustee, officer, or employee of a corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. The indemnification provided by this Section 14 will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Executive may be entitled under the articles of incorporation or the regulations of Curbline and/or of any Subsidiary, or any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in Executive s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and will continue as to Executive after Executive has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, or employee and will inure to the benefit of Executive s heirs, executors, and administrators. In particular, Executive will continue to be entitled to the full benefit of the indemnification agreement then in effect between Executive and Curbline (the Indemnification Agreement for so long as that Indemnification Agreement remains in effect according to its terms. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Section 14 and the provisions of the Indemnification Agreement, the provisions of the Indemnification Agreement shall control. 

15. Adjustment of Certain Payments and Benefits . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any payment or benefit to be paid or provided hereunder or under any other plan or agreement would be an Excess Parachute Payment, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, 

13 

or any successor provision thereto, but for the application of this sentence, then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided hereunder shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment; provided , however , that the foregoing reduction shall be made only if and to the extent that such reduction would result in an increase in the aggregate payments and benefits to be provided, determined on an after-tax basis (taking into account the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law, and any applicable federal, state and local income taxes). The determination of whether any reduction in such payments or benefits to be provided hereunder is required pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made at the expense of Curbline, if requested by Executive or Curbline, by Curbline s independent accountants or a nationally recognized law firm chosen by Curbline. The fact that Executive s right to payments or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this Section 15 shall not of itself limit or otherwise affect any other rights of Executive under this Agreement. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided hereunder is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section 15 , then the reduction will be made in accordance with Section 409A and will occur in the following order: (a) first, by reducing any cash payments with the last scheduled payment reduced first; (b) second, by reducing any equity-based benefits that are included at full value under Q A-24(a) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (the 280G Regulations ), with the highest value reduced first; (c) third, by reducing any equity-based benefits included on an acceleration value under Q A-24(b) or 24(c) of the 280G Regulations, with the highest value reduced first; and (d) fourth, by reducing any non-cash, non-equity based benefits, with the latest scheduled benefit reduced first. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 15 , to the extent that Executive s employment with Curbline TRS terminates during the Remaining SITE Service Period and this Section 15 is applicable, then references in this Section 15 to Curbline will be deemed references to SITE Centers .

Each of Curbline and SITE Centers obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations under this Agreement will not be affected by any set off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other claim whatsoever that such entity or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entity may have against Executive, except that the prohibition on set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other claim contained in this sentence will not apply if Executive s employment is terminated by such entity for Cause. Executive will not be required to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise. The amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement will not be reduced by any compensation or benefits earned by Executive as the result of employment by another employer or otherwise after the Termination Date. Neither the provisions of this Agreement nor the making of any payment provided for under this Agreement, nor the termination of any of SITE Centers or Curbline s obligations under this Agreement, will reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish Executive s rights, under any incentive compensation plan, stock option or stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or agreement, deferred compensation, retirement, or supplemental retirement plan, stock purchase and savings plan, disability or insurance plan, or other similar contract, plan, or arrangement of such entity or any subsidiary of such entity, all of which will be governed by their respective terms. 

11. Payments Are in Lieu of Severance Payments . If Executive becomes entitled to receive payments under this Agreement as a result of termination of Executive s employment, those payments will be in lieu of any and all other claims or rights that Executive may have against SITE Centers, Curbline and/or Curbline TRS for severance, separation, and/or salary continuation pay upon that termination of Executive s employment. 

12. Covenants and Confidential Information . Executive acknowledges each of SITE Centers and Curbline s reliance on and expectation of Executive s continued commitment to performance of Executive s duties and responsibilities during the Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline TRS and Executive assumes the obligations set out in this Section 12 in light of that reliance and expectation on the part of such entities. 

12.1. Noncompetition . During the Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline TRS, and for a period of 12 months thereafter, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, control, or 

10 

participate in the ownership, management, or control of, or be employed or engaged by or otherwise affiliated or associated as a consultant, independent contractor, or otherwise with the entities that are originally part of Curbline s relative total shareholder return peer group, as most recently (but no later than as of the date of Executive s termination of employment) designated with respect to performance-based awards granted to Executive; provided , however , that the ownership by Executive of not more than three percent of any class of publicly traded securities of any entity will not be deemed a violation of this Section 12.1 (such restriction that applies post-employment, the Post-Termination Restriction ). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.1 to the contrary, if the inclusion of the Post-Termination Restriction in this Agreement becomes prohibited by the law applicable to this Agreement, then such Post-Termination Restriction shall be deemed inoperative and severed from this Agreement, with this Agreement further interpreted and operated as if such Post-Termination Restriction was not included in this Agreement as of the Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 12.1 , to the extent that Executive s employment with Curbline TRS terminates during the Pre-Spin SITE Service Period, then references in this Section 12.1 to Curbline will be deemed references to SITE Centers . 

12.2. Confidentiality . Throughout and after the Contract Period, Executive will not disclose, divulge, discuss, copy, or otherwise use or suffer to be used in any manner, in competition with, or contrary to the interests of, the Companies, any confidential information relating to the Companies operations, properties, or otherwise to their particular business or other trade secrets of the Companies, it being acknowledged by Executive that all such information regarding the business of the Companies compiled or obtained by, or furnished to, Executive during Executive s employment by or association with the Companies is confidential information and the Companies exclusive property, respectively. The restrictions in this Section 12.2 will not apply to any information to the extent that it (a) is clearly obtainable in the public domain, (b) becomes obtainable in the public domain, except by reason of the breach by Executive of Executive s obligations under this Section 12.2 , (c) was not acquired by Executive in connection with Executive s employment or affiliation with the Companies, (d) was not acquired by Executive from the Companies or their representatives, or (e) is required to be disclosed by rule of law or by order of a court or governmental body or agency. However, nothing in this Agreement or in ancillary agreements is intended to interfere with or discourage the disclosure of a suspected violation of the law to any governmental entity, or to discourage Executive from participating in an investigation by a governmental entity regarding a suspected violation of the law. 

12.3. Non-Disparagement . 

(a) Throughout and after the Contract Period, outside the ordinary course of business on behalf of the Companies, Executive will not make or issue, or procure any person, firm, or entity to make or issue, any statement in any form, including written, oral and electronic communications of any kind, which conveys negative or adverse information concerning the Companies or their subsidiaries or affiliates, or any of their legal predecessors, successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries, divisions or other affiliates, or any of the foregoing s respective past, present or future directors, officers, employees or representatives (collectively, the Non-Disparagement Parties ), or any Non-Disparagement Party s business, or its actions, to any person or entity, regardless of the truth or falsity of such statement. 

(b) Throughout and after the Contract Period, the Companies will each reasonably direct the executive officers and directors of such Company not to make or issue, or procure any person, firm, or entity to make or issue, any statement in any form, including written, oral and electronic communications of any kind, which conveys negative or adverse information concerning Executive or any of Executive s legal successors, assigns, or other affiliates, or any of the foregoing s respective past, present or future directors, officers, employees or representatives (collectively, the Executive Non-Disparagement Parties ), or any Executive Non-Disparagement Party s business, or its actions, to any person or entity, regardless of the truth or falsity of such statement. 

11 

(c) This Section 12.3 does not apply to truthful testimony or disclosure compelled or required by applicable law or legal process. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or ancillary agreements to the contrary, Executive is not prohibited from providing information voluntarily to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

12.4. Nonsolicitation . During the Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline TRS, and for a period of 12 months thereafter, Executive will not directly or indirectly solicit or induce or attempt to solicit or induce any employee of the Companies and/or of any of their subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her employment with the Companies and/or any of their subsidiaries. Such requirement shall not apply to Executive during the Contract Period while Executive is employed by Curbline TRS with respect to any employee of SITE Centers as permitted by the Employee Matters Agreement. 

12.5. Remedies . Executive acknowledges that the remedy at law for any breach by Executive of this Section 12 may be inadequate and that the damages following from any such breach may not be readily susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, Executive agrees that, upon adequate proof of Executive s violation of any legally enforceable provision of this Section 12 , the Companies will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach. Nothing in this Section 12 will be deemed to limit the Companies remedies at law or in equity for any breach by Executive of any of the provisions of this Section 12 that may be pursued or availed of by the Companies. 

12.6. Acknowledgement . Executive has carefully considered the nature and extent of the restrictions upon Executive and the rights and remedies conferred upon the Companies under this Section 12 , and hereby acknowledges and agrees that the same are reasonable in time and territory, are designed to eliminate competition that otherwise would be unfair to the Companies, do not stifle the inherent skill and experience of Executive, would not operate as a bar to Executive s sole means of support, are fully required to protect the legitimate interests of the Companies, and do not confer a benefit upon the Companies disproportionate to the detriment to Executive. 

13. Compliance with Section 409A . 

13.1. Six Month Delay on Certain Payments, Benefits, and Reimbursements . If Executive is a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A (as determined under Curbline s policy for determining specified employees on the Termination Date), to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), each payment, benefit, or reimbursement paid or provided under this Agreement that constitutes a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, that is to be paid or provided as a result of a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, and that would otherwise be paid or provided at any time (a Scheduled Time that is on or before the date (the Six Month Date that is exactly six months after the Termination Date (other than payments, benefits, or reimbursements that are treated as separation pay under Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury Regulations) will not be paid or provided at the Scheduled Time but will be accumulated (together with interest at the applicable federal rate under Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code in effect on the Termination Date) through the Six Month Date and paid or provided during the period of 30 consecutive days beginning on the first business day after the Six Month Date (that period of 30 consecutive days, the Seventh Month after the Termination Date ), except that if Executive dies before the Six Month Date, the payments, benefits, or reimbursements will be accumulated only through the date of Executive s death and thereafter paid or provided not later than 30 days after the date of death. 

13.2. Additional Limitations on Reimbursements and In-Kind Benefits . The reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits provided under Section 7 or under any other section of this Agreement that are taxable benefits (and that are not disability pay or death benefit plans within the meaning of Section 409A) are intended to comply, to the maximum extent possible, with the exception to Section 409A set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury Regulations. To the extent that any reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits provided under Section 7 or under any other section of this Agreement do not qualify for that exception and are otherwise deferred compensation subject to Section 409A , then they will be subject to the following additional rules: (i) any reimbursement of eligible expenses will be paid within 30 days following Executive s written request for reimbursement; provided , however , that Executive provides written notice no later than 60 days before the last day of the calendar year 

12 

following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred so that the reimbursement can be made within the time periods required by Section 409A; (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, during any other calendar year; and (iii) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 

13.3. Compliance Generally . Each payment or reimbursement and the provision of each benefit under this Agreement shall be considered a separate payment and not one of a series of payments for purposes of Section 409A. The Companies and Executive intend that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement will either be exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A. This Agreement is to be construed, administered, and governed in a manner that effects that intent and the Companies will not take any action that is inconsistent with that intent. Without limiting the foregoing, the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement may not be deferred, accelerated, extended, paid out, or modified in a manner that would result in the imposition of an additional tax under Section 409A upon Executive. Notwithstanding any provision of Section 7 to the contrary, if the period commencing on the Termination Date begins in one taxable year of Executive and the 74th day following the Termination Date is in a subsequent taxable year, any amounts payable under Section 7 which are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A shall be paid in such subsequent taxable year. 

13.4. Termination of Employment to Constitute a Separation from Service . The parties hereto intend that the phrase termination of employment and words and phrases of similar import mean a separation from service with Curbline TRS within the meaning of Section 409A. Executive and the Companies will take all steps necessary (including taking into account this Section 13.4 when considering any further agreement regarding provision of services by Executive to Curbline after the Termination Date) to ensure that (a) any termination of employment under this Agreement constitutes a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, and (b) the Termination Date is the date on which Executive experiences a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. 

14. Indemnification . Curbline will indemnify Executive, to the full extent permitted or authorized by the Maryland General Corporation Law as it may from time to time be amended, if Executive is made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that Executive is or was a director, officer, or employee of Curbline and/or of any Subsidiary, or is or was serving at the request of Curbline and/or of any Subsidiary as a director, trustee, officer, or employee of a corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. The indemnification provided by this Section 14 will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Executive may be entitled under the articles of incorporation or the regulations of Curbline and/or of any Subsidiary, or any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in Executive s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and will continue as to Executive after Executive has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, or employee and will inure to the benefit of Executive s heirs, executors, and administrators. In particular, Executive will continue to be entitled to the full benefit of the indemnification agreement then in effect between Executive and Curbline (the Indemnification Agreement for so long as that Indemnification Agreement remains in effect according to its terms. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Section 14 and the provisions of the Indemnification Agreement, the provisions of the Indemnification Agreement shall control. 

15. Adjustment of Certain Payments and Benefits . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any payment or benefit to be paid or provided hereunder or under any other plan or agreement would be an Excess Parachute Payment, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor provision thereto, but for the application of this sentence, then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided hereunder shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment; provided , however , that the foregoing reduction shall be made only if and to the extent that such reduction would result in an increase in the aggregate payments and benefits to be provided, determined on an after-tax basis (taking into account the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law, and any applicable federal, state and local income taxes). The determination of whether any reduction in such 

13 

payments or benefits to be provided hereunder is required pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made at the expense of Curbline, if requested by Executive or Curbline, by Curbline s independent accountants or a nationally recognized law firm chosen by Curbline. The fact that Executive s right to payments or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this Section 15 shall not of itself limit or otherwise affect any other rights of Executive under this Agreement. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided hereunder is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section 15 , then the reduction will be made in accordance with Section 409A and will occur in the following order: (a) first, by reducing any cash payments with the last scheduled payment reduced first; (b) second, by reducing any equity-based benefits that are included at full value under Q A-24(a) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (the 280G Regulations ), with the highest value reduced first; (c) third, by reducing any equity-based benefits included on an acceleration value under Q A-24(b) or 24(c) of the 280G Regulations, with the highest value reduced first; and (d) fourth, by reducing any non-cash, non-equity based benefits, with the latest scheduled benefit reduced first. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 15 , to the extent that Executive s employment with Curbline TRS terminates during the Pre-Spin SITE Service Period and this Section 15 is applicable, then references in this Section 15 to Curbline will be deemed references to SITE Centers . 

16. Certain Expenses . This Section 16 will apply only to expenses that (a) are otherwise described in one or more of its subsections and (b) are incurred at any time from the Effective Date through the fifth anniversary of Executive s death. 

16.1. Reimbursement of Certain Expenses . Each applicable Company (or Curbline TRS) will pay, as incurred, all expenses, including the reasonable fees of counsel engaged by Executive, of Executive in (a) prosecuting any action to compel such Company (including Curbline, on behalf of Curbline TRS) to comply with the terms of this Agreement upon receipt from Executive of an undertaking to repay such Company for such expenses if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that Executive had no reasonable grounds for bringing such action or (b) defending any action brought by a party other than Executive or Executive s personal representative to have this Agreement declared invalid or unenforceable. 

16.2. Advancement of Certain Expenses . Expenses (including the reasonable fees of counsel engaged by Executive) incurred by Executive in defending any action, suit, or proceeding commenced or threatened against Executive for any action or failure to act as an employee, officer or director of one of the Companies and/or of any of its subsidiaries will be paid by such Company, as they are incurred, in advance of final disposition of the action, suit, or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of Executive in which Executive agrees to reasonably cooperate with such Company and/or such subsidiary, as the case may be, concerning the action, suit, or proceeding, and (a) if the action, suit, or proceeding is commenced or threatened against Executive for any action or failure to act as a director, to repay the amount if it is proved by clear and convincing evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction that his action or failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to cause injury to such Company or one of its subsidiaries or with reckless disregard for the best interests of such Company or one of its subsidiaries, or (b) if the action, suit, or proceeding is commenced or threatened against Executive for any action or failure to act as an officer or employee, to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined that Executive is not entitled to be indemnified. The obligation of each such Company to advance expenses provided for in this Section 16.2 will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Executive may be entitled under the articles/certificate of incorporation or the regulations/bylaws of such Company or of any of its subsidiaries, or any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

19. Entire Agreement .

As provided in Section 14 , Executive will continue to be entitled to the full benefit of the Indemnification Agreement for so long as it remains in effect according to its terms. For purposes of clarification, notwithstanding anything in the 2023 Agreement or this Agreement to the contrary, there shall be no duplication of compensation and benefits under the 2023 Agreement and this Agreement. 

20. Mandatory Arbitration Before a Change in Control . Section 20.1 will apply if and only if a party to this Agreement notifies another party to this Agreement, in writing, that it is demanding resolution of a then-current controversy or claim by arbitration and the notice is provided by the notifying party to such other party before any Change in Control has occurred. Nothing in this Section 20 will limit the right of each of the Companies to seek and obtain injunctive relief in a court of equity for any breach or threatened breach by Executive of any of Executive s covenants contained in Section 12 above. 

20.1. Scope of Arbitration . If this Section 20.1 applies, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any breach of this Agreement will be settled by binding arbitration to be held before three arbitrators and conducted in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association in the City of Cleveland, Ohio or New York, New York. The decision of the arbitrators will be final and binding on such parties and judgment on any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Costs and expenses of any such arbitration will be borne by the parties as may be directed by the arbitrators taking into account the extent to which the positions taken by such parties are reasonable. The arbitrators will have the power to issue mandatory orders and restraining orders in connection with any such arbitration. 

20.2. Other Disputes . If Section 20.1 does not apply to any claim or controversy between such parties, such parties may nevertheless, but need not, mutually agree to submit any controversy or claim to arbitration as though Section 20.1 did apply. Failing any such mutual agreement, either of such parties may bring proceedings against the other with respect to any claim or controversy in any court of competent jurisdiction that satisfies the venue requirements set forth in Section 21.8 . Nothing in this Section 20.2 imposes upon either of such parties any obligation to discuss possible arbitration of any claim or controversy to which Section 20.1 does not apply before bringing any court proceedings with respect to that claim or controversy. 

21. Miscellaneous . 

21.1. No Conflict .

21.4. Benefit of Agreement . The rights and obligations of SITE Centers, Curbline TRS and Curbline, respectively, under this Agreement will inure to the benefit of, and will be binding on, SITE Centers, Curbline TRS and Curbline, respectively, and each of its successors and assigns, as applicable, and the rights and obligations (other than obligations to perform services) of Executive under this Agreement will inure to the benefit of, and will be binding upon, Executive and Executive s heirs, personal representatives, and assigns. 

21.5. No Waiver . The failure of any party to enforce any provision or provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions as to any future violations thereof, nor prevent that party from later enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement. The rights granted the parties in this Agreement are cumulative and the waiver of any single remedy will not constitute a waiver of that party s right to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances. 

21.6. Modification . This Agreement may not be modified or terminated orally. No modification or termination will be valid unless in writing and signed by the parties against which the modification or termination is sought to be enforced. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Executive acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement and any compensation described herein (or described in the 2023 Agreement or any predecessor agreement) are subject to the terms and conditions of SITE Centers or Curbline s clawback provisions, policy or policies, respectively, as may be in effect from time to time, including specifically to implement Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any applicable rules or regulations promulgated thereunder (including applicable rules and regulations of any national securities exchange on which such Company s shares at any point may be traded) (the Compensation Recovery Policy ), and applicable sections of this Agreement (or the 2023 Agreement or any predecessor agreement) and any related documents shall be deemed superseded by and subject to (as applicable) the terms and conditions of the Compensation Recovery Policy. Further, Executive agrees to fully cooperate with each of the Companies in connection with any of Executive s obligations to such Company pursuant to the Compensation Recovery Policy, and agrees that such Company may enforce its rights under the Compensation Recovery Policy through any and all reasonable means permitted under applicable law as it deems necessary or desirable under the Compensation Recovery Policy, in each case from and after the effective dates thereof. 

21.7. Merger or Transfer of Assets of Curbline .

Upon any such assumption, the successor corporation will become obligated to perform the obligations of Curbline and Curbline TRS under this Agreement, and the term Curbline, as used in this Agreement, will be deemed to refer to that successor corporation, and the term Curbline Board as used in this Agreement will be deemed to refer to the board of directors of that successor corporation. 

21.8. Governing Law and Venue . The provisions of this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland applicable to contracts made in and to be performed exclusively within that State, notwithstanding any conflict of law provision to the contrary.

Exhibit 10.5 
 
 Adjustment of Outstanding SITE Centers Corp. Equity Awards (Reverse Stock Split) 
 August 19, 2024 
 Introduction 
 Effective August 19, 2024, SITE Centers Corp. SITC effectuated a reverse stock split of the outstanding common shares, par value 0.10 per share, of SITC Common Shares ), as well as those held in treasury, at a ratio of 1-for-4 (the Reverse Stock Split ). For more information about the Reverse Stock Split, please refer to the definitive proxy statement filed by SITC with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 2, 2024 (the Proxy Statement ). 
 This notice Notice describes the adjustment of outstanding SITC time-based restricted share unit, performance-based restricted share unit, and stock option awards, to the extent you held each (or any) of such awards immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split, all as now reflected in your account on the Shareworks website, as accessed through SITC s intranet. 
 Terms of Each Adjusted RSU Award 
 As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each time-based restricted share unit award that was outstanding as of immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split, and granted by SITC to you (if any) RSU Award pursuant to the terms of the applicable SITC equity incentive plan Equity Plan and related grant agreement documentation (the RSU Agreement ), was equitably adjusted pursuant to its terms effective as of the completion of the Reverse Stock Split as follows (each, an Adjusted RSU Award ): 
 The number of Common Shares subject to the unvested portion of such RSU Award was divided by four (with the result rounded down to the nearest whole Common Share, eliminating any fraction) (the Adjusted RSU Number ); and 

For any portion of such RSU Award that remained unvested, the number of Common Shares subject to such Adjusted RSU Number was divided (1) equally by, or (2) only in the case of any such RSU Award without a substantially equal number of units vesting on each date in the original vesting schedule, proportionately (in accordance with the original vesting schedule) based on, the number of vesting dates remaining in the original vesting schedule applicable to such RSU Award, and the resulting number (or numbers, as applicable, in the case of any such proportionate division) is the Adjusted RSU Per Tranche Amount . The Adjusted RSU Award will continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedule for such RSU Award, provided that each Adjusted RSU Per Tranche Amount (rounded down to the nearest whole Common Share) will vest on each of the applicable vesting dates remaining in the original vesting schedule. However, all fractional portions of all Adjusted RSU Per Tranche Amounts will be aggregated and rounded down to the nearest whole Common Share (such rounded sum, the Fractional RSU Amount ). The very first Adjusted RSU Per Tranche 

Amount to vest following the Reverse Stock Split will then be increased by the number of restricted share units equal to the Fractional RSU Amount. Any remaining fractional unit that would otherwise be settled will be eliminated for no consideration or payment. 

This adjustment was determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of SITC (the Committee under the terms of the Equity Plan. Except as provided herein, each Adjusted RSU Award continues to be governed by (1) the RSU Agreement that governs such RSU Award (implementing the changes as described in the bullet points above), and (2) the Equity Plan under which such RSU Award was granted. 
 Terms of Each Adjusted PRSU Award 
 As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each performance-based restricted share unit award that was outstanding as of immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split and granted by SITC to you (if any) PRSU Award pursuant to the terms of the Equity Plan and related grant agreement documentation (the PRSU Agreement ), was equitably adjusted pursuant to its terms effective as of the completion of the Reverse Stock Split as follows (each, an Adjusted PRSU Award ): 
 The target number of Common Shares subject to such PRSU Award was divided by four (with the result rounded down to the nearest whole Common Share, eliminating any fraction); and 

The beginning stock price for SITC for purposes of the performance metrics and goals applicable to such PRSU Award was multiplied by four (with the result rounded up to the nearest whole cent). 

This adjustment was determined by the Committee under the terms of the Equity Plan. Except as provided herein, each Adjusted PRSU Award generally continues to be governed by (1) the PRSU Agreement that governs such PRSU Award (implementing the two changes as described in the bullet points above), and (2) the Equity Plan under which such PRSU Award was granted. 
 Terms of Each Adjusted Option 
 As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each stock option that was outstanding as of immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split and granted by SITC to you (if any) Option pursuant to the terms of the Equity Plan and related grant agreement documentation (the Option Agreement ), was equitably adjusted pursuant to its terms effective as of the completion of the Reverse Stock Split as follows (each, an Adjusted Option ): 
 The exercise price of the Option was multiplied by four; and 

The number of Common Shares subject to such Option was divided by four (with the result rounded down to the nearest whole Common Share, eliminating any fraction). 

These adjustments were determined by the Committee under the terms of the Equity Plan. Except as provided herein, each Adjusted Option continues to be governed by (1) the Option Agreement that governs such Option (implementing the changes as described in the bullet points above), and (2) the Equity Plan under which such Option was granted.
