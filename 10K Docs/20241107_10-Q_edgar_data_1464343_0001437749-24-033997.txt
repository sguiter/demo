Atlanticus Holdings Corporation and Subsidiaries 
 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Loans at amortized cost, net. Our loans at amortized cost, net, currently consist of receivables associated with our Auto Finance segment s operations and are presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets net of the related allowance for credit losses and deferred revenue. We purchased auto loans with outstanding principal of million, million, million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, through our pre-qualified network of independent automotive dealers and automotive finance companies. 
 
 Certain of our loans at amortized cost, net, also contain components of deferred revenue related to loan discounts on the purchase of our auto finance receivables. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average remaining accretion period for the million and million of deferred revenue reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets was and months, respectively. 
 
 A roll-forward (in millions) of our allowance for credit losses by class of receivable is as follows: 
 Provision for credit losses 
 Charge-offs 
 Recoveries 
 Balance at end of period 

Provision for credit losses 
 Charge-offs 
 Recoveries 
 Balance at end of period 

Balance at end of period collectively evaluated for impairment 
 Loans at amortized cost: 
 Loans at amortized cost 
 Loans at amortized cost individually evaluated for impairment 
 Loans at amortized cost collectively evaluated for impairment 

We consider loan delinquencies a key indicator of credit quality because this measure provides the best ongoing estimate of how a particular class of receivables is performing. An aging of our delinquent loans at amortized cost (in millions) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows: 

60-89 days past due 
 90 or more days past due 
 Delinquent loans at amortized cost 
 Current loans at amortized cost 
 Total loans at amortized cost 
 Balance of loans greater than 90-days delinquent still accruing interest and fees 

Loan Modifications and Restructurings 

We review our Loans at amortized cost, net, associated with our Auto Finance segment s operations to determine if any modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty were made that would qualify the receivable as a Financial Difficulty Modification ("FDM"). This could include a restructuring of the loan terms to alleviate the burden of the borrower's near-term cash requirements, such as a modification of terms to reduce or defer cash payments to help the borrower attempt to improve its financial condition. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , no Loans at amortized cost qualified as a FDM. 

and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In all periods, the factors that decreased our effective tax rate relative to the statutory rate included 1 our deduction for income tax purposes of amounts characterized in our condensed consolidated financial statements as dividends on a preferred stock issuance, such amounts constituting deductible interest expense on a debt issuance for tax purposes and 2 deductions associated with the exercises of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock at times when the fair value of our stock exceeded such share-based awards grant date values. Also, in all periods, the factors that increased our effective tax rate relative to the statutory rate included 1 state and foreign income tax expense, including the effects of law changes enacted in certain states in which we operate, 2 taxes on global intangible low-taxed income, and 3 deduction disallowance under Section 162 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with respect to compensation paid to our covered employees. 
 
 We report interest expense associated with our income tax liabilities (including accrued liabilities for uncertain tax positions) within our income tax line item on our condensed consolidated statements of income. We likewise report within such line item the reversal of interest expense associated with our accrued liabilities for uncertain tax positions to the extent we resolve such liabilities in a manner favorable to our accruals therefor. Our net interest expense reflected within our income tax line item was for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
 
 Revenue from contracts with customers is included in Other revenue on our condensed consolidated statements of income. Components (in thousands) of our revenue from contracts with customers are as follows: 

Servicing income 
 Service charges and other customer related fees 
 Total revenue from contracts with customers 

1 Interchange revenue is presented net of customer reward expense.

On March 31, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022 - 02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326 ): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. Topic 326 eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors while adding disclosures for certain loan restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. This guidance requires an entity to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. Additionally, Topic 326 requires disclosure of current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables. The disclosures required by Topic 326 are required for receivables held at amortized cost and exclude those accounted for using fair value. The Company adopted Topic 326 on January 1, 2023. As the significant majority of the Company's receivables are held at fair value, the adoption of Topic 326 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial results and accompanying disclosures.

 Preferred Stock 
 
 In June and July 2021, we issued an aggregate of shares of Series B Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, liquidation preference of per share (the "Series B preferred stock"), for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting expenses and the structuring fee. We pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series B preferred stock, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, in the amount of per share each year, which is equivalent to 7.625 of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased and contemporaneously retired shares and shares of Series B preferred stock at an aggregate cost of and . shares of Series B preferred stock were repurchased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 ATM Programs 
 
 On August 10, 2022, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the "Preferred Stock Sales Agreement") providing for the sale by the Company of up to an aggregate offering price of million of our (i) Series B preferred stock and (ii) Senior Notes due 2026 (the "2026 Senior Notes"), from time to time through a sales agent, in connection with the Company's Series B preferred stock and 2026 Senior Notes "at-the-market" offering program (the "Preferred Stock ATM Program"). On August 26, 2024, we amended and restated the Preferred Stock Sales Agreement to remove our 2026 Senior Notes and to include our Senior Notes due 2029 (the "2029 Senior Notes") in the Preferred Stock ATM Program. On December 29, 2023, the Company entered into an At-The-Market Sales Agreement (the "Common Stock Sales Agreement") providing for the sale by the Company of its common stock, no par value per share, up to an aggregate offering price of million, from time to time to or through a sales agent, in connection with the Company s common stock ATM Program ("Common Stock ATM Program"). Sales pursuant to both the Preferred Stock Sales Agreement and Common Stock Sales Agreement, if any, may be made in transactions that are deemed to be "at-the-market offerings" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), including sales made directly on or through the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The sales agents will make all sales using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with their normal trading and sales practices up to the amount specified in, and otherwise in accordance with the terms of, the placement notices. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we sold shares, shares, shares and shares, respectively, of our Series B preferred stock under our Preferred Stock ATM Program for net proceeds of million, million, million and million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 2026 Senior Notes were sold under the Company's Preferred Stock ATM Program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we sold million principal amount of our 2029 Senior Notes under our Preferred Stock ATM Program for net proceeds of million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , common shares were sold under the Company s Common Stock ATM Program. 

million at any time outstanding. On December 27, 2019, the Company issued shares of its Series A Preferred Stock with an aggregate initial liquidation preference of million, in exchange for full satisfaction of the million that the Company owed Dove under the Loan and Security Agreement. Dividends on the preferred stock are per annum (cumulative, non-compounding) and are payable as declared, and in preference to any dividends on common stock and Series B preferred stock, in cash. The Series A Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. The Company may, at its option, redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock on or after January 1, 2025 at a redemption price equal to per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. At the request of holders of a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Company shall offer to redeem all of the Series A Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to 100 per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, at the option of the holders thereof, on or after January 1, 2024. Upon the election by the holders of a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, each share of the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into the number of shares of the Company s common stock as is determined by dividing (i) the sum of (a) 100 and (b) any accumulated and unpaid dividends on such share by (ii) an initial conversion price equal to per share, subject to certain adjustment in certain circumstances to prevent dilution. Given the redemption rights contained within the Series A Preferred Stock, we account for the outstanding preferred stock as temporary equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Dividends paid on the Series A Preferred Stock are deducted from Net income attributable to controlling interests to derive Net income attributable to common shareholders. The common stock issuable upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock is included in our calculation of Net income attributable to common shareholders per share diluted. See Note 11, "Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests Per Common Share" for more information.

 On November 14, 2019, a wholly-owned subsidiary issued million Class B preferred units at a purchase price of per unit to an unrelated third party. The units carry a preferred return to be paid quarterly, with up to percentage points of the preferred return to be paid through the issuance of additional units or cash, at our election. The units have both call and put rights and are also subject to various covenants including a minimum book value, which if not satisfied, could allow for the securities to be put back to the subsidiary. In March 2020, the subsidiary issued an additional million Class B preferred units under the same terms. A holder of the Class B preferred units may, at its election and with notice, require the Company to redeem part or all of such holder s Class B preferred units for cash at 1.00 per unit, on or after October 14, 2024. The proceeds from the transaction were used for general corporate purposes. The Company has the right to redeem the Class B preferred units at any time with notice. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we redeemed million of the Class B preferred units at per unit plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon. We have included the issuance of these Class B preferred units as temporary noncontrolling interest on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Dividends paid on the Class B preferred units are deducted from Net income attributable to controlling interests to derive Net income attributable to common shareholders. See Note 11, "Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests Per Common Share" for more information. 

Valuations and Techniques for Assets 
 
 Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The table below summarizes (in thousands) by fair value hierarchy the September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 fair values and carrying amounts of 1 our assets that are carried at fair value in our condensed consolidated financial statements and 2 our assets not carried at fair value, but for which fair value disclosures are required: 

Loans at fair value 

Loans at fair value 

1 For cash, deposits and investments in equity securities, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 

For those asset classes above that are carried at fair value in our condensed consolidated financial statements, gains and losses associated with fair value changes are detailed on our condensed consolidated statements of income as a component of "Changes in fair value of loans." Gross yield net of finance charge chargeoffs (including late fees and interest charges on outstanding balances), payment rates, servicing rates and expected net principal credit loss rates vary based on the delinquency or payment behavior of a consumer and impact the return rate third -party market participants would require. As such, we consider all of these risks as credit risk. For our loans included in the above table, we assess the fair value of these assets based on our estimate of future cash flows net of servicing costs, and to the extent that such cash flow estimates change from period to period, any such changes are considered to be attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk. 

For Level 3 assets carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs, the following table presents (in thousands) a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 2 As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the aggregate unpaid principal balance included within loans at fair value was million and million, respectively. 

The unrealized gains and losses for assets within the Level 3 category presented in the tables above include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. 
 
 Loans at Fair Value. 

The fair value of Loans at fair value is based on the present value of future cash flows using a valuation model of expected cash flows and the estimated cost to service and collect those cash flows. We estimate the present value of these future cash flows using internally-developed estimates of assumptions third -party market participants would use in determining fair value, including estimates of credit losses, payment rates, servicing costs, discount rates and yields earned on private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables. We forecast the cash flows underlying our fair value assessment based on the individual offer type (in the case of general purpose credit cards) or by specific offers at our retail partners (for private label credit). While overall product return requirements among the offer types may be similar, the individual product offerings necessary to achieve those returns is often unique to each offer and retailer based on several factors, including acceptance rates of the offers by consumers and underlying consumer performance data which varies by offer type . 
 
 Our fair value models include market degradation to reflect the possibility of delinquency rates increasing in the near term (and the corresponding increase in charge-offs and decrease in payments) above the level that current trends would suggest. Further, recent rules enacted by the CFPB, which, if implemented, would further limit the late fees charged to consumers in most instances, are expected to adversely impact the revenue recognized on our receivables. Our fair value models currently assume an implementation of these rules in July 2025. In order to mitigate these impacts and continue to serve consumers, we have worked collaboratively with our bank partners to assist them in taking a number of steps, from modifying products and policies (such as further tightening the criteria used to evaluate new loans) to changing prices (including increasing interest rates and fees charged to consumers). While our bank partners have the flexibility to unilaterally make changes to program offerings and must approve all changes to existing or new program offerings, we are only obligated to acquire receivables originated by the bank that utilized mutually agreed upon underwriting standards. The changes will take several quarters to fully implement. These modifications and the timing of the CFPB's rules implementation could result in changes to certain estimates such as credit losses, payment rates, servicing costs, discount rates and yields earned on credit card receivables and affect the reported amount (and changes thereon) of our Loans at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated statements of income. Our Loans at fair value are typically lower than the aggregate unpaid gross balance of the underlying loans primarily due to merchant fees we obtain associated with the acquisition of private label credit receivables. These merchant fees ensure that we achieve adequate returns on the investment in the receivables. As these merchant fees reduce the amount of cash we use to acquire the receivable, it is not always necessary for us to collect the aggregate unpaid gross balance of the underlying receivable to achieve desired returns. 

Valuations and Techniques for Liabilities 
 
 Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the liability. The table below summarizes (in thousands) by fair value hierarchy the September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 fair values and carrying amounts of our liabilities not carried at fair value, but for which fair value disclosures are required: 

Amortizing debt facilities 
 Senior notes, net 

Amortizing debt facilities 
 Senior notes, net 

For our credit and debt facilities where market prices are not available, we assess the fair value of these liabilities based on our estimate of future cash flows generated from their underlying credit card receivables collateral, net of servicing compensation required under the note facilities, and to the extent that such cash flow estimates change from period to period, any such changes are considered to be attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk. We have evaluated the fair value of our third party debt by analyzing the expected repayment terms and credit spreads included in our recent financing arrangements obtained with similar terms. These recent financing arrangements provide positive evidence that the underlying data used in our assessment of fair value has not changed relative to the general market and therefore the fair value of our debt continues to be the same as the carrying value. See Note 9, "Notes Payable," for further discussion on our other notes payable.

In August 2021, we entered into an operating lease agreement for our corporate headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia (the "Headquarters lease") with an unaffiliated third party. This Headquarters lease initially covered approximately square feet and commenced in June 2022 for a month term. The remaining total commitment under this lease is approximately million and is included in the table above. In connection with the commencement of this lease, we discontinued most of the subleasing arrangements with third parties for space at our corporate headquarters. A right-of-use asset and liability was recorded at the commencement date of this lease. 
 
 We exercised an expansion right under the Headquarters lease to add an additional 26,133 square feet (the "Expansion space") at our corporate headquarters. The Expansion space term commences on the earlier of December 23, 2024 or when we first occupy the space, which has not yet occurred. The Expansion space co-terminates with the Headquarters lease. The other lease terms for the Expansion space are the same as those for the initial space leased under the Headquarters lease. 
 
 In addition, we occasionally lease certain equipment under cancelable and non-cancelable leases, which are accounted for as capital leases in our condensed consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024 , we had no material non-cancelable capital leases with initial or remaining terms of more than one year.

billion at September 30, 2024 . We have never experienced a situation in which all borrowers have exercised their entire available lines of credit at any given point in time, nor do we anticipate this will ever occur in the future. Moreover, there would be a concurrent increase in assets should there be any exercise of these lines of credit. 
 
 Additionally, our CAR operations provide floor-plan financing for a pre-qualified network of independent automotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy-here, pay-here used car business. The floor plan financing allows dealers and finance companies to borrow up to the maximum pre-approved credit limit allowed in order to finance ongoing inventory needs. These loans are secured by the underlying auto inventory and, in certain cases where we have other lending products outstanding with the dealer, are secured by the collateral under those lending arrangements as well, including any outstanding dealer reserves. As of September 30, 2024 , CAR had unfunded outstanding floor-plan financing commitments totaling million. Each draw against unused commitments is reviewed for conformity to pre-established guidelines and is not unconditional. 
 
 Under agreements with third -party originating and other financial institutions, we have pledged security (collateral) related to their issuance of consumer credit and purchases thereunder, of which million remains pledged as of September 30, 2024 to support various ongoing contractual obligations. 
 
 Under agreements with third -party originating and other financial institutions, we have agreed to indemnify the financial institutions for certain liabilities associated with the services we provide on behalf of the financial institutions such indemnification obligations generally being limited to instances in which we either (a) have been afforded the opportunity to defend against any potentially indemnifiable claims or (b) have reached agreement with the financial institutions regarding settlement of potentially indemnifiable claims. As of September 30, 2024 , we have assessed the likelihood of any potential payments related to the aforementioned contingencies as remote. We would accrue liabilities related to these contingencies in any future period when we assess the likelihood of an estimable payment as probable. 
 
 Under the account terms, consumers have the option of enrolling with our issuing bank partners in a credit protection program, which would make the minimum payments owed on their accounts for a period of up to six months upon the occurrence of an eligible event. Eligible events typically include loss of life, job loss, disability, or hospitalization. As an acquirer of receivables, our potential exposure under this program, if all eligible participants applied for this benefit, was million as of September 30, 2024 . We have never experienced a situation in which all eligible participants have applied for this benefit at any given point in time, nor do we anticipate this will ever occur in the future. We include our estimate of future claims under this program within our fair value analysis of the associated receivables. 
 Concentrations 
 
 We acquire all of our fair value receivables under agreements with two third -party originating institutions. 
 
 Our top five retail partnerships accounted for over of our private label receivables outstanding as of September 30, 2024 . The volume of receivables purchased each period varies based on a number of factors, including seasonal consumer purchase patterns and growth (or contraction) within merchant retail locations. Further impacting receivable purchase amounts in a period are consumer application volumes that retail partners may direct to our bank partners versus competitors who offer similar financing products to those retail merchant partners. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had purchases from our top five retail partners of the following (in millions):

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we included million shares of common stock for each period in our outstanding diluted share counts associated with our Series A Preferred Stock. See Note 5, "Redeemable Preferred Stock," for a further discussion of these convertible securities. 

shares of our common stock under the plan. Our Fourth Amended 2014 Plan provides that we may grant equity awards representing up to shares of our common stock to members of our Board of Directors, employees, consultants and advisors. The Fourth Amended 2014 Plan was approved by our shareholders in May 2019. As of September 30, 2024 , shares remained available for issuance under the ESPP and shares remained available for issuance under the Fourth Amended 2014 Plan. 
 
 Exercises and vestings under our stock-based compensation plans resulted in income tax-related charges to paid-in capital during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had forfeitures (net of grants) of shares and shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units, respectively, with aggregate grant date fair values for both periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had grants (net of forfeitures) of shares and shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units, respectively, with aggregate grant date fair values of million and million, respectively. We incurred expenses of million, million, million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to restricted stock awards. When we grant restricted stock and restricted stock units, we defer the grant date value of the restricted stock and restricted stock unit and amortize that value (net of the value of anticipated forfeitures) as compensation expense with an offsetting entry to the paid-in capital component of our condensed consolidated shareholders equity. Our restricted stock awards typically vest over a range of to months (or other term as specified in the grant which may include the achievement of performance measures) and are amortized to salaries and benefits expense ratably over applicable vesting periods. As of September 30, 2024 , our unamortized deferred compensation costs associated with non-vested restricted stock awards were million with a weighted-average remaining amortization period of years. No forfeitures have been included in our compensation cost estimates based on historical forfeiture rates.

Stock Options 
 
 The exercise price per share of each option awarded under the Fourth Amended 2014 Plan must be equal to or greater than the market price on the date the option is granted. The option period may not exceed years from the date of grant. We had expense of million, million, million and million related to stock option-related compensation costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

options were issued during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We had million and million of unamortized deferred compensation costs associated with non-vested stock options as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with a weighted average remaining amortization period of years as of September 30, 2024 . Upon exercise of outstanding options, the Company issues new shares. 

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included therein and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, where certain terms have been defined. 
 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes forward-looking statements. We base these forward-looking statements on our current plans, expectations and beliefs about future events. There are risks, including the factors discussed in "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Report, that our actual experience will differ materially from these expectations. For more information, see "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information" below. 
 
 In this Report, except as the context suggests otherwise, "Company," "Atlanticus Holdings Corporation," "Atlanticus," "we," "our," "ours," and "us" refer to Atlanticus Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries and predecessors. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 Atlanticus is a financial technology company powering more inclusive financial solutions for everyday Americans. We leverage data, analytics, and innovative technology to unlock access to financial solutions for the millions of Americans who would otherwise be underserved. According to data published by Experian, 40 of Americans had FICO scores of less than 700. We believe this equates to a population of over 100 million everyday Americans in need of access to credit. These consumers often have financial needs that are not effectively met by larger financial institutions. By facilitating appropriately priced consumer credit and financial service alternatives with value-added features and benefits curated for the unique needs of these consumers, we endeavor to empower better financial outcomes for everyday Americans. Through our subsidiaries, we provide technology and other support services to lenders who offer an array of financial products and services to consumers who may have been declined by other providers of credit. Both private label and general purpose card products are originated by The Bank of Missouri and WebBank (collectively, our bank partners ). Our bank partners originate these accounts through multiple channels , including retail and healthcare point-of-sale locations, direct mail solicitation, digital marketing and partnerships with third parties. The services of our bank partners are often extended to consumers who may not have access to financing options with larger financial institutions. Our flexible technology solutions allow our bank partners to integrate our paperless process and instant decisioning platform with the existing infrastructure of participating retailers, healthcare providers and other service providers. Using our technology and proprietary predictive analytics, lenders can make instant credit decisions utilizing hundreds of inputs from multiple sources and thereby offer credit to consumers overlooked by many providers of financing which focus exclusively on consumers with higher FICO scores. Atlanticus underwriting process is enhanced by machine learning, enabling lenders to make fast, sound decisions when it matters most. 
 
 We are principally engaged in providing products and services to lenders in the U.S. for which these lenders pay us a fee and in most circumstances, the lenders are then obligated to sell us the receivables they generate from these products and services. We acquire these receivables for the principal amount of the loan less any up-front fees and any third party or merchant fees associated with the receivables. We compensate our bank partners monthly for the regulatory oversight they provide associated with our acquired receivables, the underlying accounts of which they continue to own and service, and also based on variable levels of the underlying performance of the acquired receivables. From time to time, we also purchase receivables portfolios from third parties. In this Report, "receivables" or "loans" typically refer to receivables we have purchased from our bank partners or from third parties. 
 
 Currently, within our Credit as a Service ("CaaS") segment, we apply our technology solutions, in combination with the experiences gained, and infrastructure built from servicing over 41 billion in consumer loans over more than 25 years of operating history, to support lenders in offering more inclusive financial services. These products include private label credit cards using the Fortiva and Curae brand names as well as merchant associated brands. Our general purpose credit cards use the Aspire, Imagine and Fortiva brand names. Private label credit products associated with the healthcare space are generally issued under the Curae brand while all other retail partnerships, including those in consumer electronics, furniture, elective medical procedures, and home-improvement use the Fortiva brand or use our retail partners brands. Our flexible technology solutions allow our bank partners to integrate our paperless process and instant decisioning platform with the existing infrastructure of participating retailers, healthcare providers and other service providers. 
 
 Using our infrastructure and technology, we also provide loan servicing, including risk management and customer service outsourcing, for third parties. Also, through our CaaS segment, we engage in testing and limited investment in consumer finance technology platforms as we seek to capitalize on our expertise and infrastructure. Additionally, we report within our CaaS segment: 1) servicing income and 2) gains or losses associated with investments previously made in consumer finance technology platforms. These include investments in companies engaged in mobile technologies, marketplace lending and other financial technologies. None of these companies are publicly-traded and the carrying value of our investment in these companies is not material. One of these companies, Fintiv Inc., has sued Apple, Inc., Walmart, Inc., and PayPal Holdings, Inc. for patent infringement. Fintiv Inc. has approximately 150 patents related to secure money transfer on computer and mobile devices. The transaction volume in these areas has increased dramatically over the last five years. If Fintiv Inc. is successful in the patent litigation, there could be large exposure, including treble damages for these companies. The claimed losses sustained by this patent infringement are substantial and could be measured in the billions of dollars. We believe on a diluted basis that we will own over 10 of the company. Apple has vigorously contested the claims, and we expect it to continue doing so. In light of the uncertainty around these lawsuits, we will continue to carry these investments on our books at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes. 
 
 The recurring cash flows we receive within our CaaS segment principally include those associated with (1) private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables, (2) servicing compensation and (3) credit card receivables portfolios that are unencumbered or where we own a portion of the underlying structured financing facility.

Private label credit 
 
 Our bank partners work with both us and with their retail partners to provide financing options to retail consumers. These financing options vary by retail partner and consists of a range in APRs of 0 - 36 and a range in merchant fees of 0 - 65 . Merchant fees, which vary by retail partner, offset the purchase price our bank partners remit to the retail partner on a consumer transaction. These merchant fees are used to enhance the return on products when contractual APRs or other terms are insufficient due to promotional or other below market pricing retail merchants may offer to consumers (such as 0 APR offers). Financing arrangements may include fees to enhance yields on a product including annual and/or monthly maintenance fees. Additionally, terms of these products offered to consumers may include deferred interest options whereby consumers pay no interest on their purchases over periods ranging from 6-12 months. Terms of these products can range from 12 months to 84 months based on the retail merchant partner. Each offer is customized for retail clients based on the expected performance of the underlying receivables, receivable purchase volumes and overall return requirements. Our flexible technology allows retail partners to present financing offers to their customers through a variety of delivery options including retail point of sale locations, online transactions, or through in home sales. These financing arrangements are based on underwriting standards tailored to each retail partner and are the result of a close collaboration between our bank partners and us to ensure all products are compliant with regulatory requirements and to ensure they provide attractive terms to consumers. When a consumer accepts the terms of a financing arrangement for the purchase of a good or service and completes the underlying transaction, our bank partners forward the net purchase price (net of merchant or other fees) to the retail partner. Our bank partners are then obligated to sell, and we are obligated to purchase, the receivable (along with rights to all future finance and fee billings associated with the receivable) from our bank partners under similar terms, which best reflects the receivables fair value at the time of acquisition with no gain or loss recognized. 
 
 General Purpose Credit Cards 
 
 We work closely with our bank partners to assist them in creating general purpose credit card offers. These offers have varying lines of credit ranging from 350 to 3,000, annual percentage rates APRs ranging from 19.99 to 36 , annual fees ranging from 0 to 175 and monthly maintenance fees ranging from 0 to 15. Our agreements with our bank partners obligate them to sell and for us to acquire the receivables associated with underlying purchases and subsequent fee and finance billings. We acquire these receivables for the principal amount of any related purchase less any up-front or third-party fees associated with the receivables which best reflects the receivables fair value at the time of acquisition with no gain or loss recognized. As discussed above, our bank partners continue to provide ongoing account management and oversight for both our Private label credit and General purpose credit card receivables, for which we compensate the bank partners monthly. 
 
 For both our Private label credit and General purpose credit card purchases from our bank partners, the initial acquisition of receivables is at fair value, with no gain recognized. All finance charges, fees and merchant fees are recognized into earnings through our Consumer loans, including past due fees (interest income, including finance charges, late payment fees on loans and merchant fees), Fees and related income on earning assets (for annual or monthly maintenance fees, cash advance fees and other fees directly associated with the extension of credit) and Other revenue (for interchange and ancillary product offerings such as credit protection), on our Consolidated Statements of Income when they are billed to consumers or, in the case of merchant fees, when the receivable is assessed for fair value. We value these principal and fee receivables within Changes in fair value of loans on our Consolidated Statements of Income to reflect our best estimate of ongoing economics and cash flows associated with existing consumer accounts including future estimates of finance and fee billings and consumer payment rates typical of the assumptions a market participant would use to calculate fair value. 
 
 Our credit and other operations are heavily regulated, potentially causing us to change how we conduct our operations either in response to regulation or in keeping with our goal of leading the industry in adherence to consumer-friendly practices. We have made meaningful changes to our practices over the past several years, and because our account management practices are evolutionary and dynamic, it is possible that we may make further changes to these practices, some of which may produce positive, and others of which may produce adverse, effects on our operating results and financial position. Customers at the lower end of the credit score range intrinsically have higher loss rates than do customers at the higher end of the credit score range. As a result, the products we support are priced to reflect expected loss rates for our various risk categories. See "Consumer and Debtor Protection Laws and Regulations CaaS Segment" in Part I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" contained in this Report.

Subject to possible disruptions caused by the uncertain economic environment, we believe that our private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables are generating, and will continue to generate, attractive returns on assets, thereby facilitating debt financing under terms and conditions (including advance rates and pricing) that will support attractive returns on equity, and we continue to pursue growth in this area. 
 
 Within our Auto Finance segment, our CAR subsidiary operations principally purchase and/or service loans secured by automobiles from or for, and also provide floor-plan financing for, a pre-qualified network of independent automotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy-here, pay-here used car business. We generate revenues on purchased loans through interest earned on the face value of the installment agreements combined with the accretion of discounts on loans purchased. We generally earn discount income over the life of the applicable loan. Additionally, we generate revenues from servicing loans on behalf of dealers for a portion of actual collections and by providing back-up servicing for similar quality assets owned by unrelated third parties. We offer a number of other products to our network of buy-here, pay-here dealers (including our floor-plan financing offering), but the majority of our activities are represented by our purchases of auto loans at discounts and our servicing of auto loans for a fee. As of September 30, 2024, our CAR operations served over 670 dealers in 34 states and two U.S. territories. The core operations continue to perform well (achieving consistent profitability and generating positive cash flows).

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Total operating revenue. Total operating revenue consists of: 1) interest income, finance charges and late fees on consumer loans, 2) other fees on credit products including annual, monthly service, and merchant fees and 3) ancillary, interchange and servicing income on loan portfolios. 
 
 Period-over-period results primarily relate to growth in private label credit and general purpose credit card products, the receivables of which increased to 2,653.8 million as of September 30, 2024 from 2,314.6 million as of September 30, 2023. We experienced modest growth in total operating revenues for both our general purpose credit card and our private label credit receivables for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023. These increases were primarily due to consistent quarterly growth in new credit card customers serviced and seasonally driven growth with private label credit receivables and also reflected increased fee and finance pricing requirements for all new receivable acquisitions in response to increased costs of capital used to finance these receivable acquisitions. Additionally , g rowth within our private label credit receivables for the first and second quarters of 2024 was largely due to continued growth associated with our largest existing retail partners, growth which typically increases late in the second quarter and into the third quarter of each year based on our retail partners' seasonal sale cycles. This seasonal growth in private label credit receivables was at its highest in the third quarter of 2024 when we increased receivable purchases by 152.3 million when compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 The relative mix of receivable acquisitions can lead to some variation in our corresponding revenue as general purpose credit card receivables typically generate higher gross yields than private label credit receivables do. We are currently experiencing continued period-over-period growth in private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables growth that we expect to result in net period-over-period growth in our total interest income and related fees for these operations throughout 2024. Future periods growth is also dependent on the addition of new retail partners to expand the reach of private label credit operations as well as growth within existing partnerships and the level of marketing investment for the general purpose credit card operations. Other revenue on our condensed consolidated statements of income consists of ancillary, interchange and servicing income. Ancillary and interchange revenues are largely impacted by growth in our receivables as discussed above , and recent new product offerings to consumers also resulted in a modest increase in this category of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023. See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies and Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Components " to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this revenue from contracts with customers. Interchange fees are earned when customers we serve use their cards over established card networks. We earn a portion of the interchange fee the card networks charge merchants for the transaction. We earn servicing income by servicing loan portfolios for third parties. Unless and/or until we grow the number of contractual servicing relationships we have with third parties or our current relationships grow their loan portfolios, we will not experience significant growth and income within this category. The above discussions on expectations for finance, fee and other income are based on our current expectations. Recent rules enacted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), which, if implemented, would further limit the late fees charged to consumers in most instances, are expected to adversely impact the revenue recognized on our receivables. In order to mitigate these impacts and continue to serve consumers, we have worked collaboratively with our bank partners to assist them in taking a number of steps, from modifying products and policies (such as further tightening the criteria used to evaluate new loans) to changing prices (including increasing interest rates and fees charged to consumers). While our bank partners have the flexibility to unilaterally make changes to program offerings and must approve all changes to existing or new program offerings, we are only obligated to acquire receivables originated by our bank partners when they utilize mutually agreed upon underwriting standards. We believe these product, policy, and pricing changes will offset the negative impact of potential reduced late fees. The changes will take several quarters to fully implement. 
 
 For more information, refer to Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors" and, in particular, " The CFPB recently issued a final rule regarding credit card late fees, which represents a significant departure from the rules that are currently in effect. The rules are currently enjoined from implementation. If implemented in the future, we expect the rule would have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition for at least the short term and, depending on the effectiveness of our actions taken in response to the rule, potentially over the long term ." 
 
 Other non-operating revenue. Included within our Other non-operating revenue category is income (or loss) associated with investments in non-core businesses or other items not directly associated with our ongoing operations. None of these companies are publicly-traded and there are no material pending liquidity events. We will continue to carry the investments on our books at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes. 
 
 Interest expense. Variations in interest expense are due to new borrowings and increased costs of capital associated with growth in private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables and CAR operations as evidenced within Note 9, "Notes Payable," to our condensed consolidated financial statements, offset by our debt facilities being repaid commensurate with net liquidations of the underlying credit card, auto finance and installment loan receivables that serve as collateral for the facilities. Outstanding notes payable, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, associated with our private label credit and general purpose credit card platform increased to 1,976.8 million as of September 30, 2024 from 1,719.7 million as of September 30, 2023. Corresponding interest expense increased 14.2 million and 38.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The majority of this increase in outstanding debt relates to the addition of multiple credit facilities in 2023 and 2024. Recent increases in the effective interest rates on debt have increased our interest expense as we have raised additional capital (or replaced existing facilities) over the last two years. We anticipate additional debt financing over the next few quarters as we continue to grow coupled with higher effective interest rates on new debt compared to rates on maturing debt. As such, we expect our quarterly interest expense for these operations to increase compared to prior periods. Adding to interest expense in 2024, we sold approximately 73.5 million and 130.8 million aggregate principal amount of 9.25 Senior Notes due 2029 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Provision for credit losses. Our provision for credit losses covers, with respect to such receivables, changes in estimates regarding our aggregate loss exposures on (1) principal receivable balances, (2) finance charges and late fees receivable underlying income amounts included within our total interest income category, and (3) other fees receivable. Recoveries of charged off receivables, consist of amounts received from the efforts of third-party collectors and through the sale of charged-off accounts to unrelated third parties. All proceeds received associated with charged-off accounts, are credited to the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 We have experienced a period-over-period increase in our provision for credit losses primarily associated with increases in loss estimates associated with our Auto Finance segment's floorplan loans. Most risk of loss in our Auto Finance segment is widely diversified. Floorplan loans offered to dealers to finance auto inventory increase our exposure to loss. We take several steps to mitigate this risk including holding title to the underlying collateral, ongoing reassessments of collateral value and regular audits at participating dealer locations. Nevertheless, the timing of losses is difficult to predict. Recent stress noted at some dealer locations is incorporated into our loss estimates and resulted in increased provisions for credit losses for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies and Consolidated Financial Statement Components," to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further credit quality statistics and analysis.

Changes in fair value of loans. The increase in Changes in fair value of loans was largely driven by growth in the underlying receivables (as noted above) as well as changes in assumptions due to recent rules enacted by the CFPB, which, if implemented, would further limit the late fees charged to consumers in most instances. For all periods presented, we included asset performance degradation in our forecasts to reflect both changes in assumed asset level economics and the possibility of delinquency rates increasing in the near term (and the corresponding increase in charge-offs and decrease in payments) above the level that current trends would suggest. In recent periods we have removed some of this expected degradation based on observed asset stabilization, implementation of mitigants to a potential change in late fee billings and general improvements in U.S. economic expectations due to the improved inflation environment. See Note 6 "Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities" included herein for further discussion of this calculation. For credit card receivables for which we use fair value accounting, we expect our change in fair value of credit card receivables recorded at fair value to increase commensurate with growth in these receivables. We may, however, adjust our forecasts to reflect macroeconomic events. Thus, the fair values are subject to potentially high levels of volatility if we experience changes in the quality of our credit card receivables or if there are significant changes in market valuation factors (e.g., interest rates and spreads) in the future. Tightened underwriting standards adopted during the second quarter 2022 (and continued in subsequent quarters) shifted new receivable acquisitions to consumers at the higher end of the FICO band in which our bank partners participate, presumably resulting in improved overall performance of our acquired receivables. When coupled with those existing assets negatively impacted by inflation gradually becoming a smaller percentage of the outstanding portfolio, we expect to see overall improvements in the measured fair value of our portfolios of acquired receivables. As part of our analysis to determine the fair value of our receivables, we look at several key factors that influence the overall fair value. Qualitative discussion of these factors is as follows: 
 
 Gross yield, net of finance charge chargeoffs We utilize gross yield, net of finance charge chargeoffs in our fair value assessments to best reflect the expected net collected yield on fee billings on our receivables. As the size and composition of our portfolio fluctuates, or as we experience periods of growth or decline in our acquisition of new receivables, this rate can fluctuate. We have experienced marginal declines in our weighted-average, Gross yield, net of finance charge chargeoffs rate used in our fair value calculations as of September 30, 2024, when compared to rates used as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024 largely due to a shift in the overall portfolio mix towards private label credit receivables acquired that tend to have lower effective yields but also for which we have limited loss exposure due to agreements with retail partners. Our general purpose credit card receivables experienced an increase in this same rate for the noted periods due to the aforementioned product, policy, and pricing changes and tightened underwriting standards. As these product policy and pricing changes continue to further impact both newly acquired and existing private label credit receivables and general purpose credit card receivables, we expect our gross yield, net of finance charge chargeoffs rate to increase over time although the pace and timing of purchases for new general purpose credit card receivables, relative to those of private label credit receivables, could result in near term declines in this rate. The acquisition of private label credit receivables, particularly those noted above, is largely seasonal in nature, peaking in the second and third quarters of each year. As a result, we would expect this weighted average rate to decrease in those periods absent the offset of our higher yielding general purpose credit card receivables acquired during the same period. While our bank partners have enacted product, policy, and pricing changes on our existing receivables (and all newly acquired receivables), these changes will take several quarters to be fully realized. As a result, if the CFPB rules related to late fees become effective, prior to full implementation of our bank partners' changes, we would expect to experience near term declines in this rate. 
 
 Payment Rate Our total portfolio payment rate has declined marginally over time largely due to the increased relative weight of acquisitions of private label credit receivables to our overall pool of receivables. These receivables tend to include less finance and fee billings that factor into monthly payment amounts (due to associated merchant fee billings that provide us adequate returns on the receivables) and have payment terms that extend over longer periods. As a result, payment rates on private label credit receivables are naturally lower than those associated with our general purpose credit card receivables. This was particularly influenced by strong growth in the aforementioned private label credit receivables acquired during the second and third quarters of 2024 that have limited loss exposure and tend to have longer associated terms and lower effective payment rates. This decline in payment rates is not evident in our credit card portfolio, which maintained relatively stable payment rates over the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Servicing Rate Our servicing rate has fluctuated marginally over time as we continue to implement processes and strategies to more efficiently and effectively service the accounts underlying our outstanding receivables portfolios. As delinquent accounts tend to have a higher cost of servicing, recent trending declines in our receivables that are 90 or more days past due also has resulted in lower expected future costs. We expect our servicing rate will remain relatively consistent over the next several quarters. 
 
 Expected Net Principal Credit Loss Rate Our Expected net principal credit loss rate is chiefly impacted by the relative makeup of receivables within our pools. As we have acquired a higher number of receivables associated with our private label credit accounts for which we have limited loss exposure due to agreements with retail partners, particularly in the second and third quarters of 2024, our Expected net principal credit loss rate has decreased. Additionally, we have noted reductions in the Expected net principal credit loss rate associated with our general purpose credit card receivables, which have shown (and are expected to continue to show) continued overall improvements in delinquency rates. With growth in the acquisition of our private label credit receivables, particularly those noted above with limited loss exposure, and growth in better performing general purpose credit card receivables, we expect this weighted average rate to decrease over the next several quarters (when compared to similar periods in prior years) before stabilizing. 
 
 Discount Rate Our weighted average discount rate has remained relatively consistent over the past several quarters (and is expected to continue to remain consistent). Primarily impacting modest shifts in our weighted average discount rate are mix shifts in the type of receivables acquired, as different receivable types (general purpose credit card receivables versus private label credit receivables) have different expected return requirements used by third-party market participants. As we have acquired a higher number of receivables associated with our private label credit accounts for which we have limited loss exposure due to agreements with retail partners, our weighted average discount rate has decreased marginally. We consider asset specific financing costs associated with our receivables (coupled with our internal cost of equity capital in agreements that require credit enhancements) as the best indicator of return requirements used by third-party market participants. Recent indications by the Federal Reserve of decreased interest rates could lead to further reductions in our weighted average discount rate if we see a corresponding decrease in return requirements used by third-party market participants.

Total operating expenses. Total operating expenses variances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, relative to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflect the following: 

increases in salaries and benefit costs related to both the growth in the number of employees for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and inflationary compensation pressure. We expect some continued increase in this cost for the remainder of 2024 compared to corresponding periods in 2023 as we expect our receivables to continue to grow and as a result we expect to continue to modestly increase our number of employees 

increases in card and loan servicing expenses due to growth in receivables associated with our investments in private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables, which grew to 2,653.8 million outstanding from 2,314.6 million outstanding at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and costs associated with the implementation of product, policy, and pricing changes discussed above. As many of the expenses associated with our card and loan servicing efforts are now variable based on the amount of underlying receivables, we would expect this number to continue to grow in 2024 and future periods commensurate with growth in our receivables; 

modest increases in marketing and solicitation costs for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as total growth in new accounts serviced was in line with combined growth observed in the first and second quarters of 2023. These modest increases in marketing and solicitation costs for both periods is a direct result of the increased costs associated with assisting our bank partners to acquire new consumers using tightened underwriting standards resulting from the planned CFPB restrictions on late fee assessments. As we continue to adjust our underwriting standards to reflect changes in fee and finance assumptions on new receivables, and allow for overall increases in the cost to successfully market to consumers, we expect period over period marketing costs for 2024 to increase relative to those experienced in 2023, although the frequency and timing of increased marketing efforts could vary and are dependent on macroeconomic factors such as national unemployment rates and federal funds rates and 

other expenses primarily relate to costs associated with occupancy or other third party expenses that are largely fixed in nature. Some costs including legal expenses and travel expenses are variable based on growth and have grown as we expand our marketing and growth efforts. Increases in this category for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily relate to certain nonrecurring costs associated with accounting and legal expenditures. While we expect some increase in these costs as we continue to grow our receivable portfolios, we do not anticipate the increase to be meaningful. 

Certain operating costs are variable based on the levels of accounts and receivables we service (both for our own receivables and for others) and the pace and breadth of our growth in receivables. However, a number of our operating costs are fixed. As we have significantly grown our managed receivables levels over the past two years with minimal increase in the fixed portion of our card and loan servicing expenses as well as our salaries and benefits costs, we have realized greater operating efficiency. 
 
 Notwithstanding our cost management activities, we expect increased levels of expenditures associated with anticipated growth in private label credit and general purpose credit card operations. These expenses will primarily relate to the variable costs of marketing efforts and card and loan servicing expenses associated with new receivable acquisitions. Unknown ongoing potential impacts related to the aforementioned inflation and other global disruptions could result in more variability in these expenses and could impair our ability to acquire new receivables, resulting in increased costs despite our efforts to manage costs effectively. 
 
 Noncontrolling interests. We reflect the ownership interests of noncontrolling holders of equity in our majority-owned subsidiaries as noncontrolling interests in our condensed consolidated statements of income. In November 2019, a wholly-owned subsidiary issued 50.5 million Class B preferred units at a purchase price of 1.00 per unit to an unrelated third party. The units carry a 16 preferred return paid quarterly, with up to 6 percentage points of the preferred return to be paid through the issuance of additional units or cash, at our election. The units have both call and put rights and are also subject to various covenants including a minimum book value, which if not satisfied, could allow for the securities to be put back to the subsidiary. In March 2020, the subsidiary issued an additional 50.0 million Class B preferred units under the same terms. A holder of the Class B preferred units may, at its election and with notice, require the Company to redeem part or all of such holder s Class B preferred units for cash at 1.00 per unit, on or after October 14, 2024. The Company has the right to redeem the Class B preferred units at any time with notice. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we redeemed 25.5 million of the Class B preferred units at 1.00 per unit plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon. We have included the issuance of these Class B preferred units as temporary noncontrolling interests on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the associated dividends are included as a reduction of our net income attributable to common shareholders on the condensed consolidated statements of income.

Income Taxes. We experienced effective tax rates of 21.5 and 19.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 21.2 and 22.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In all periods, the factors that decreased our effective tax rate relative to the statutory rate included (1) our deduction for income tax purposes of amounts characterized in our condensed consolidated financial statements as dividends on a preferred stock issuance, such amounts constituting deductible interest expense on a debt issuance for tax purposes and (2) deductions associated with the exercises of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock at times when the fair value of our stock exceeded such share-based awards grant date values. Also, in all periods, the factors that increased our effective tax rate relative to the statutory rate included (1) state and foreign income tax expense, including the effects of law changes enacted in certain states in which we operate, (2) taxes on global intangible low-taxed income, and (3) deduction disallowance under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with respect to compensation paid to our covered employees. 
 
 We report interest expense associated with our income tax liabilities (including accrued liabilities for uncertain tax positions) within our income tax line item on our condensed consolidated statements of income. We likewise report within such line item the reversal of interest expense associated with our accrued liabilities for uncertain tax positions to the extent we resolve such liabilities in a manner favorable to our accruals therefor. Our net interest expense reflected within our income tax line item was 140,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 CaaS Segment 
 
 Our CaaS segment includes our activities related to our servicing of and our investments in the private label credit and general purpose credit card operations, our various credit card receivables portfolios, as well as other product testing and investments that generally utilize much of the same infrastructure. The types of revenues we earn from our investments in receivables portfolios and services primarily include fees and finance charges, merchant fees or annual fees associated with the private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables. 
 
 We record (i) the finance charges, merchant fees and late fees assessed on our CaaS segment receivables in the Revenue - Consumer loans, including past due fees category on our condensed consolidated statements of income, (ii) the annual, monthly maintenance, returned-check, cash advance and other fees in the Revenue - Fees and related income on earning assets category on our condensed consolidated statements of income, and (iii) the charge-offs (and recoveries thereof) as a component within our Changes in fair value of loans on our condensed consolidated statements of income. Additionally, we show the effects of fair value changes for those credit card receivables for which we have elected the fair value option as a component of Changes in fair value of loans in our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 
 We historically have invested in receivables portfolios through subsidiary entities. If we control through direct ownership or exert a controlling interest in the entity, we consolidate it and reflect its operations as noted above. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, we present managed receivables, total managed yield, total managed yield ratio, combined principal net charge-off ratio, percent of managed receivables 30-59 days past due, percent of managed receivables 60-89 days past due and percent of managed receivables 90 or more days past due, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures aid in the evaluation of the performance of our credit portfolios, including our risk management, servicing and collection activities and our valuation of purchased receivables. The credit performance of our managed receivables provides information concerning the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent with the portfolios. Management relies heavily upon financial data and results prepared on the "managed basis" in order to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance and allocate resources. 
 
 These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures or the calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures are provided below for each of the fiscal periods indicated. 
 
 These non-GAAP financial measures include only the performance of those receivables underlying consolidated subsidiaries (for receivables carried at amortized cost basis and fair value). Additionally, we calculate average managed receivables based on the quarter-end balances. 
 
 The comparison of non-GAAP managed receivables to our GAAP financial statements requires an understanding that managed receivables reflect the face value of loans, interest and fees receivable without any adjustment for potential credit losses to reflect fair value.

 The fair value mark against receivables reflects the difference between the face value of a receivable and the net present value of the expected cash flows associated with that receivable. See Note 6, "Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities" to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of this calculation. 

(2) 
 Total managed receivables are equal to the Aggregate unpaid gross balance of loans at fair value. See Note 6, "Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities" to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of the Aggregate unpaid gross balance of loans at fair value. 

(3) 
 The Fair value to Total managed receivables ratio is calculated using Loans at fair value as the numerator, and Total managed receivables as the denominator. 

As discussed above, our managed receivables data differ in certain aspects from our GAAP data. First, managed receivables data are based on fee billings. Fee billings include finance charges, late fee billings, annual fees, monthly maintenance fees and other ancillary product enhancements. Managed receivables data are also based on actual charge-offs as they occur and without regard to any merchant fees , changes in fair value of loans or changes in our allowances for credit losses (in periods where applicable). Second, for managed receivables data, we amortize certain fees (such as annual and merchant fees) and expenses (such as marketing expenses) associated with our Fair Value Receivables over the expected life of the corresponding receivable and recognize other costs, such as claims made under credit deferral programs, when paid. Under fair value accounting, these fees are recognized when billed or upon receivable acquisition and marketing expenses are recognized when incurred. A reconciliation of our operating revenues, net of finance and fee charge-offs, to comparable amounts used in our calculation of Total managed yield ratios is as follows:

Our delinquency and charge-off data at any point in time reflect the credit performance of our managed receivables. The average age of the accounts underlying our receivables, the timing and size of receivable purchases, the success of our collection and recovery efforts and general economic conditions all affect our delinquency and charge-off rates. The average age of the accounts underlying our portfolios of receivables also affects the stability of our delinquency and loss rates. We consider this delinquency and charge-off data in our allowances for credit losses for our other credit product receivables that we report at amortized cost. Our strategy for managing delinquency and receivables losses consists of account management throughout the life of the receivable. This strategy includes credit line management and pricing based on the risks. See also our discussion of collection strategy under "Collection Strategy" in Item 1, "Business" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The following discussion relates to the tables above. 
 
 Managed receivables levels. We have continued to experience overall period-over-period quarterly receivables growth with over 339.2 million in net receivables growth associated with the private label credit and general purpose credit card products offered by our bank partners from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The addition of large private label credit retail partners and ongoing purchases of receivables arising in accounts issued by our bank partners to customers of our existing retail partners helped grow our private label credit receivables by 261.5 million in the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. Our general purpose credit card receivables grew by 77.6 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. While some of our merchant partners continue to face year-over-year growth challenges, others are benefiting from continued consumer spending and a growing economy. Our general purpose credit card portfolio continues to grow in terms of total customers served and therefore we continue to experience growth in total managed receivables. We expect continued growth in our managed receivables when compared to prior periods in 2023 which were restricted due to tightened underwriting standards adopted during the second quarter 2022 (and continued in subsequent quarters). Growth in 2024 has been somewhat restricted due to our initial response to rule changes enacted by the CFPB. In order to mitigate these impacts and continue to serve consumers, our bank partners have taken a number of steps, from modifying products and policies (such as further tightening the criteria used to evaluate new loans) to changing prices (including increasing interest rates and fees charged to consumers). We believe these product, policy, and pricing changes will offset the negative impact of potential reduced late fees. The changes will take several quarters to fully implement and some changes (for private label credit receivables) will only be implemented upon an effective date for the potential CFPB rules. In the short term, these changes could impact new receivable acquisitions. Growth in future periods for our private label credit receivables largely is dependent on the addition of new retail partners to the private label credit origination platform, the timing and size of solicitations within the general purpose credit card platform by our bank partners, as well as purchase activity of consumers. Similarly, the loss of existing retail partner relationships could adversely affect new loan acquisition levels. Our top five retail partnerships accounted for over 75 of our private label receivables outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The volume of receivables purchased each period varies based on a number of factors, including seasonal consumer purchase patterns and growth (or contraction) within merchant retail locations. Further impacting receivable purchase amounts in a period are consumer application volumes that retail partners may direct to our bank partners versus competitors who offer similar financing products to those retail merchant partners. See Note 10, "Commitments and Contingencies," to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of these concentrations. 
 
 Delinquencies. Delinquencies have the potential to impact net income in the form of net credit losses. Delinquencies also are costly in terms of the personnel and resources dedicated to resolving them. We intend for the receivables management strategies we use on our portfolios to manage and, to the extent possible, reduce the higher delinquency rates that can be expected with the younger average age of the newer receivables in our managed portfolio. These management strategies include conservative credit line management and collection strategies intended to optimize the effective account-to-collector ratio across delinquency categories. We measure the success of these efforts by reviewing delinquency rates. These rates exclude receivables that have been charged off. 
 
 During 2023, we experienced increased delinquency rates, when compared to the same periods in 2022, in conjunction with slower receivables growth, higher energy costs and rising inflation and the resulting negative impact on consumers. These increases abated in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 as certain of these costs decreased and consumers adjusted to new price points for these consumer staples while simultaneously enjoying a strong employment environment. Increases in the first and second quarters of 2024 in our Private label credit receivables were largely due to a mix shift in receivables acquired to certain receivables that have higher observed delinquencies but correspondingly higher yields. In the second and third quarters of 2024, we additionally acquired receivables that have higher observed delinquencies, but for which we have limited loss exposure due to agreements with retail partners. As a result of these limited loss exposures, these receivables are not included in our delinquency rates for private label credit receivables. Our delinquency rates for our general purpose credit cards receivables were higher in the first quarter of 2024 due to both a reduction in the growth of our managed receivables and accounts that were enrolled in short-term payment deferrals, due to hardship claims resulting from COVID-19. Receivables enrolled in these short-term payment deferrals continued to accrue interest and their delinquency status did not change through their respective deferment periods. We continue to actively work with consumers that indicate hardship as a result of COVID-19 however, the number of impacted consumers is a small part of our overall receivable base. The remainder of these accounts were removed from hardship status with the end of the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies in May 2023. While these accounts resulted in higher than normal reported delinquency rates for the first quarter of 2024 (and correspondingly higher chargeoffs in the first and second quarters of 2024), the charge offs did not result in a further economic impact to us as the majority of these accounts were already considered in our changes in fair value in prior periods. As these accounts were largely charged off by the end of the first quarter we saw some modest improvement in our second quarter 2024 delinquencies offset by slower net receivables growth during this period. 
 
 As we continue to acquire newer private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables, we expect our delinquency rates to marginally decrease when compared to the same periods in prior years due to a planned shift in our general purpose and private label credit receivables originated using more restrictive product, policy, and pricing changes. We also expect continued seasonal payment patterns on these receivables that impact our delinquencies in line with prior periods. For example, delinquency rates historically are lower in the second quarter of each year due to the benefits of seasonally strong payment patterns associated with tax refunds for many consumers. Included in this expected decrease in delinquencies is continued growth in the portfolio which will also mute delinquency metrics. Our beliefs for future delinquency rates are predicated on the assumption that the slowing rate of inflation will continue and our recent tightened underwriting standards will prove effective at reducing account delinquencies. 
 
 Total managed yield ratio, annualized. As discussed above, growth in higher yielding assets has resulted in higher charge-off and delinquency rates in some periods. General purpose credit card receivables tend to have higher total yields than private label credit receivables (and corresponding higher charge off rates). As a result, in periods where we have declines in rates of growth of these general purpose credit card receivables, as was noted in 2024 (relative to growth in private label credit receivables), we expect to have slightly lower total managed yield ratios. We currently expect increases in the acquisition of receivables and correspondingly higher period-over-period operating revenue for the remainder of 2024. This growth also includes an expected seasonal shift in our mix of acquired private label receivables to higher FICO receivables that have lower gross yields (and correspondingly lower charge-off expectations) in the third quarter of each year, which may result in marginally lower managed yield ratios when compared to the corresponding periods in prior years. 
 
 Combined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized. We charge off our CaaS segment receivables when they become contractually more than 180 days past due or 120 days past due if they are enrolled in an installment loan product. For all of our products, we charge off receivables within 30 days of notification and confirmation of a customer s bankruptcy or death. However, in some cases of death, we do not charge off receivables if there is a surviving, contractually liable individual or an estate large enough to pay the debt in full. When the principal of an outstanding loan is charged off, the related finance charges and fees are simultaneously charged off, resulting in a reduction to our Total managed yield. 
 
 Growth within our general purpose credit card receivables (as a percent of outstanding receivables) has resulted in increases in our charge-offs over time. The increase in the combined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized throughout 2023 and the first two quarters of 2024 is a reflection of increased delinquencies noted as consumer behavior reverted to historical norms (similar to those experienced in periods prior to COVID-19) and decreases in the acquisition of new general purpose credit card receivables. Additionally, inflation, particularly as it relates to higher gas prices, negatively impacted some consumers' ability to make payments on outstanding loans and fees receivable.

Table of Contents 

Despite the expected marginal increases in delinquency rates as discussed above, we expect our overall combined principal net charge-off ratios to continue to decrease for the remainder of 2024, when compared to the comparable prior period. These charge-off rates are expected to return to historically normalized levels, adjusted for the mix shift discussed above, and will benefit from planned growth in the underlying receivables which we expect will further reduce our combined principal net charge-off ratio. Our charge-off ratio has also been impacted due to (and will continue to be impacted by): 1) higher expected charge-off rates on the private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables corresponding with higher yields on these receivables, (2) continued testing of receivables with higher risk profiles, leading to periodic increases in combined principal net charge offs, (3) the aforementioned tightened underwriting standards that will slow the pace of growth in our receivables base, and (4) negative impacts on some consumers' ability to make payments on outstanding loans and fees receivable as a result of recent inflation. While charge-offs associated with previously mentioned accounts enrolled in short-term payment deferrals had a negative impact on our Combined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized through the second quarter of 2024, they did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of income as the majority of these accounts were already considered in our changes in fair value. Further impacting our charge-off rates are the timing and size of solicitations that serve to minimize charge-off rates in periods of high receivable acquisitions but also exacerbate charge-off rates in periods of lower receivable acquisitions. 
 
 Interest expense ratio, annualized. Our interest expense ratio, annualized reflects interest costs associated with our CaaS segment. This includes both direct receivables funding costs as well as general unsecured lending. Recent impacts to this ratio primarily relate to the timing and size of outstanding debt as well as the addition of new funding facilities. In general, we have historically obtained lower cost financing with fixed interest rates, resulting in lower interest expense ratios. Increases in the federal funds borrowing rate have led to an increase in spreads for newly-originated debt and for that portion of debt that does not have fixed rates. As such, we have seen our Interest expense ratio, annualized increase throughout 2023 and 2024 and we expect the interest expense ratio to increase when compared to prior quarters for the remainder of 2024 as we replace existing financing arrangements with new ones at a higher cost of capital. 
 
 Net interest margin ratio, annualized. Our Net interest margin ratio, annualized represents the difference between our Total managed yield ratio, annualized, our Combined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized and our Interest expense ratio, annualized. Recent declines in this ratio, when compared to corresponding prior periods, relate primarily to recent increases in our principal net charge-offs as noted above. Given the above noted expectations for marginal improvements in our Combined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized, we expect this ratio to start to improve relative to corresponding periods in 2023. Changes in the mix shift of acquired receivables, noted above, will also lead to increases in the Net interest margin, annualized as the higher yielding receivables become a larger component of our total portfolio. 
 
 Average APR. The average annual percentage rate ("APR") charged to customers varies by receivable type, credit history and other factors. The APRs for receivables originated through our private label credit platform range from 0 to 36.0 . For general purpose credit card receivables, APRs typically range from 19.99 to 36.0 . We have experienced minor fluctuations in our average APR based on the relative product mix of receivables purchased during a period. For those receivables that did not contain fixed APRs we have seen some increases in rates charged, as the underlying rates are tied to the federal funds borrowing rate which increased through the first seven months of 2023. We currently expect our average APRs in 2024 to remain consistent with average APRs over the past several quarters however, the timing and relative mix of receivables acquired could cause some minor fluctuations. We do not acquire or service receivables that have an APR above 36.0 . 
 
 Receivables purchased during period. Receivables purchased during period reflect the gross amount of investments we have made in a given period, net of any credits issued to consumers during that same period. For most periods presented, our private label credit receivable purchases experienced overall growth largely based on the addition of new private label credit retail partners as well as growth within existing retail partnerships, as previously discussed. We may experience periodic declines in these acquisitions due to: the loss of one or more retail partners seasonal purchase activity by consumers labor shortages and supply chain disruptions or the timing of new customer originations by our issuing bank partners. We currently expect to see increases in receivable acquisitions associated with our retail partnerships when compared to the same period in prior years, although we expect the pace of acquisitions to slow. Our general purpose credit card receivable acquisitions tend to have more volatility based on the issuance of new credit card accounts by our issuing bank partners and the availability of capital to fund new purchases. Recent product, policy, and pricing changes will take time to be fully implemented. As a result, the timing of new receivable acquisitions, particularly as it relates to general purpose credit cards, could be impacted in the short term. Nonetheless, we expect continued growth in the acquisition of these general purpose credit card receivables during 2024 and into 2025. 
 
 Auto Finance Segment 
 
 CAR, our auto finance platform acquired in April 2005, principally purchases and/or services loans secured by automobiles from or for, and also provides floorplan financing for, a prequalified network of independent automotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy-here, pay-here used car business. We have expanded these operations to also include certain installment lending products in addition to our traditional loans secured by automobiles both in the U.S. and U.S. territories. 
 
 Collectively, as of September 30, 2024, we served over 670 dealers through our Auto Finance segment in 34 states and two U.S. territories.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 For reasons set forth above within our CaaS segment discussion, we also provide managed receivables-based financial, operating and statistical data for our Auto Finance segment. Reconciliation of the auto finance managed receivables data to GAAP data requires an understanding that our managed receivables data are based on billings and actual charge-offs as they occur, without regard to any changes in our allowances for credit losses. Similar to the managed calculation above, the average managed receivables used in the ratios below is calculated based on the quarter ending balances of consolidated receivables.

Managed receivables. Recent stress noted at some dealer locations has resulted in higher than anticipated credit losses associated with floorplan loans. When coupled with increased delinquencies associated with the underlying consumers loans, we have experienced period over period declines in our managed receivables for the third quarter of 2024. We expect modest growth in the level of our managed receivables for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025 although we may continue to be below managed receivables levels (when compared to the same periods in prior years for the next few quarters as we rebuild our receivables base and CAR expands within its current geographic footprint and continues plans for service area expansion. Although we continue to expand our CAR operations, the Auto Finance segment faces strong competition from other specialty finance lenders, as well as the indirect effects on us of our buy-here, pay-here dealership partners competition with other franchise dealerships for consumers interested in purchasing automobiles. We continually evaluate bulk purchases of receivables and experienced good growth in our receivables base throughout 2023 resulting from several bulk purchases however, the timing and size of such purchases are difficult to predict. 
 
 Delinquencies. While we have experienced recent increases in our delinquency rates (and related charge-offs), we do not believe they will have a significantly adverse impact on our results of operations beyond the third quarter of 2024 as we have established appropriate reserves for these losses even at slightly elevated rates, we earn significant yields on CAR s receivables and have significant dealer reserves (i.e., retainages or holdbacks on the amount of funding CAR provides to its dealer customers) and other collateral to protect against meaningful credit losses. Delinquency rates also tend to fluctuate based on seasonal trends and historically are lower in the second quarter of each year as seen above due to the benefits of strong payment patterns associated with tax refunds for many consumers. 
 
 Total managed yield ratio, annualized. We have experienced modest fluctuations in our total managed yield ratio largely impacted by the relative mix of receivables in various products offered by CAR as some shorter-term product offerings tend to have higher yields. Yields on our CAR products over the last few quarters are consistent with our expectations over the coming quarters. Further, we expect our total managed yield ratio to remain in line with current experience, with moderate fluctuations based on relative growth or declines in average managed receivables for a given quarter. These variations depend on the relative mix of receivables in our various product offerings. Additionally, our product offerings in the U.S. territories tend to have slightly lower yields than those offered in the U.S. As such, growth in that region also will serve to slightly depress our overall total managed yield ratio, yet we expect growth in that region to continue to generate attractive returns on assets. 
 
 Combined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized and recovery ratio, annualized. We charge off auto finance receivables when they are between 120 and 180 days past due, unless the collateral is repossessed and sold before that point, in which case we will record a charge off when the proceeds are received. Combined principal net charge-off ratios in the above table reflect the lower delinquency rates we have recently experienced. Increases in our Combined principal net charge-off ratios for the fourth quarter of 2022 and throughout 2023 are indicative of our charge off levels returning to historically normalized levels (i.e., those periods prior to COVID-19 and the related government stimulus programs). While we anticipate our charge offs to be incurred ratably across our portfolio of dealers, specific dealer-related losses are difficult to predict and can negatively influence our combined principal net charge-off ratio as was evidenced throughout 2024. We continually re-assess our dealers and will take appropriate action if we believe a particular dealer s risk characteristics adversely change. While we have appropriate dealer reserves to mitigate losses across the majority of our pool of receivables, the timing of recognition of these reserves as an offset to charge offs is largely dependent on various factors specific to each of our dealer partners including ongoing purchase volumes, outstanding balances of receivables and current performance of outstanding loans. As such, the timing of charge-off offsets is difficult to predict however, we believe that these reserves are adequate to offset any loss exposure we may incur. Additionally, the products we issue in the U.S. territories do not have dealer reserves with which we can offset losses. We also expect our recovery rate to fluctuate modestly from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the sale of repossessed autos. 
 Definitions of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Total managed yield ratio, annualized. Represents an annualized fraction, the numerator of which includes (as appropriate for each applicable disclosed segment) the: 1) finance charge and late fee income billed on all consolidated outstanding receivables and the amortization of merchant fees, collectively included in the consumer loans, including past due fees category on our condensed consolidated statements of income plus 2) credit card fees (including over-limit fees, cash advance fees, returned check fees and interchange income), earned, amortized amounts of annual membership fees with respect to certain credit card receivables, collectively included in our fees and related income on earning assets category on our condensed consolidated statements of income plus 3) servicing, other income and other activities collectively included in our other operating income category on our condensed consolidated statements of income minus 4) finance charge and fee losses from consumers unwilling or unable to pay their receivables balances, as well as from bankrupt and deceased consumers. The denominator is our average managed receivables.

Table of Contents 

Combined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized . Represents an annualized fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate consolidated amounts of principal losses from consumers unwilling or unable to pay their receivables balances, as well as from bankrupt and deceased consumers, less current-period recoveries (including recoveries from dealer reserve offsets for our CAR operations), as reflected in Note 2 "Significant Accounting Policies and Consolidated Financial Statement Components" and Note 6 "Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities" and the denominator of which is average managed receivables. Recoveries on managed receivables represent all amounts received related to managed receivables that previously have been charged off, including payments received directly from consumers and proceeds received from the sale of those charged-off receivables. Recoveries typically have represented less than 2 of average managed receivables. 
 
 Interest expense ratio, annualized. Represents an annualized fraction, the numerator of which is the annualized interest expense associated with the CaaS segment (See Note 3, "Segment Reporting" to our condensed consolidated financial statements) and the denominator of which is average managed receivables. 
 
 Net interest margin ratio, annualized. Represents the Total managed yield ratio, annualized less the Combined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized less the Interest expense ratio, annualized. 
 
 LIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our primary focus is expanding the reach of our financial technology in order to grow our private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables and generate revenues from these investments that will allow us to maintain consistent profitability. Increases in new and existing retail partnerships and the expansion of our investments in general purpose credit card finance products have resulted in year-over-year growth of total managed receivables levels, and we expect growth to continue in the coming quarters. 
 
 Accordingly, we will continue to focus on (i) obtaining the funding necessary to meet capital needs required by the growth of our receivables, (ii) adding new retail partners to our platform to continue growth of the private label credit receivables, (iii) growing general purpose credit card receivables, (iv) effectively managing costs, and (v) repurchasing outstanding shares of our common and preferred stock. We believe our unrestricted cash, future cash provided by operating activities, availability under our debt facilities, and access to the capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs. 
 
 All of our CaaS segment s structured financing facilities are expected to amortize down with collections on the receivables within their underlying trusts and should not represent significant refunding or refinancing risks to our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Facilities that could represent near-term and longer-term refunding or refinancing needs as of September 30, 2024 are those associated with the following notes payable in the amounts indicated (in millions): 

Revolving credit facility (expiring December 11, 2024) that is secured by certain receivables and restricted cash 

16.8 

Revolving credit facility (expiring March 29, 2025) that is secured by restricted cash 

21.0 

Revolving credit facility (expiring July 20, 2025) that is secured by certain receivables and restricted cash 

24.7 

Class B preferred units issued to noncontrolling interests (redeemable on or after October 14, 2024) 

75.0 

Total short term refinancing needs (within 12 months) 

137.5 

Revolving credit facility (expiring October 30, 2025) that is secured by certain receivables and restricted cash 

49.8 

Revolving credit facility (expiring December 1, 2026) that is secured by certain assets 

34.4 

Revolving credit facility (expiring July 15, 2027) that is secured by certain receivables and restricted cash 

50.0 

Revolving credit facility (expiring August 30, 2027) that is secured by certain receivables and restricted cash 

12.5 

Total long term refinancing needs (in excess of 12 months) 

146.7 

Total refinancing needs 

284.2 

Based on the state of the debt capital markets, the performance of our assets that serve as security for the above facilities, and our relationships with lenders, we view imminent refunding or refinancing risks with respect to the above facilities as moderate in the current environment. We believe that the quality of our new receivables should allow us to raise more capital through increasing the size of our facilities with our existing lenders and attracting new lending relationships, albeit at increased costs due to the aforementioned recent interest rate increases. Further details concerning the above debt facilities and other debt facilities we use to fund the acquisition of receivables are provided in Note 9, "Notes Payable," to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. 
 
 In November 2021, we issued 150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125 Senior Notes due 2026 (the "2026 Senior Notes"). The 2026 Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company s existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and will rank senior in right of payment to the Company s future subordinated indebtedness, if any. The 2026 Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all of the Company s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and the 2026 Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company s subsidiaries (excluding any amounts owed by such subsidiaries to the Company). The 2026 Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 6.125 per annum. Interest on the 2026 Senior Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year. The 2026 Senior Notes will mature on November 30, 2026. We are amortizing fees associated with the issuance of the 2026 Senior Notes into interest expense over the expected life of such notes. Amortization of these fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 0.4 million, 1.1 million, 0.4 million and 1.1 million, respectively. We repurchased 0, 0.4 million, 0.3 million and 1.1 million of the outstanding principal amount of these 2026 Senior Notes in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 In January and February 2024, we issued an aggregate of 57.2 million aggregate principal amount of 9.25 Senior Notes due 2029 (the "2029 Senior Notes"). In July 2024, we issued an additional 60.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Senior Notes. The 2029 Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company s existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and will rank senior in right of payment to the Company s future subordinated indebtedness, if any. The 2029 Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all of the Company s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and the 2029 Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company s subsidiaries (excluding any amounts owed by such subsidiaries to the Company). The 2029 Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 9.25 per annum. Interest on the 2029 Senior Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. The 2029 Senior Notes will mature on January 31, 2029. We are amortizing fees associated with the issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes into interest expense over the expected life of such notes. Amortization of these fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 0.3 million and 0.5 million, respectively.

In June and July 2021, we issued an aggregate of 3,188,533 shares of 7.625 Series B Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, liquidation preference of 25.00 per share (the "Series B preferred stock"), for net proceeds of approximately 76.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting expenses and the structuring fee. We pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series B preferred stock, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, in the amount of 1.90625 per share each year, which is equivalent to 7.625 of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share. 
 
 On August 10, 2022, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the "Preferred Stock Sales Agreement") providing for the sale by the Company of up to an aggregate offering price of 100.0 million of our (i) Series B preferred stock and (ii) 2026 Senior Notes, from time to time through a sales agent, in connection with the Company's "at-the-market" offering program (the "Preferred Stock ATM Program"). On August 26, 2024 we amended and restated the Preferred Stock Sales Agreement to remove our 2026 Senior Notes and to include our 9.25 Senior Notes under the Preferred Stock ATM Program. Further, on December 29, 2023, the Company entered into an At-The-Market Sales Agreement (the "Common Stock Sales Agreement") providing for the sale by the Company of its common stock, no par value per share (the "common stock"), up to an aggregate offering price of 50.0 million, from time to time to or through a sales agent, in connection with the Company s Common Stock "at-the-market" offering program (the "Common Stock ATM Program"). Sales pursuant to both the Preferred Stock Sales Agreement and Common Stock Sales Agreement, if any, may be made in transactions that are deemed to be "at-the-market offerings" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on or through the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The sales agents will make all sales using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with their normal trading and sales practices up to the amount specified in, and otherwise in accordance with the terms of, the placement notices. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we sold 0 shares, 44,143 shares, 300 shares and 53,727 shares, respectively, of our Series B preferred stock under our Preferred Stock ATM Program for net proceeds of 0 million, 1.1 million, 0.0 million and 1.1 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no 2026 Senior Notes were sold under the Company's Preferred Stock ATM Program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 13.5 million principal amount of our 2029 Senior Notes under our Preferred Stock ATM Program for net proceeds of 13.4 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no common shares were sold under the Company s Common Stock ATM Program. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased and contemporaneously retired 0 shares and 1,806 shares of Series B preferred stock at an aggregate cost of 0 and 29,000. No shares of Series B preferred stock were repurchased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 On November 14, 2019, a wholly-owned subsidiary issued 50.5 million Class B preferred units at a purchase price of 1.00 per unit to an unrelated third party. The units carry a 16 preferred return to be paid quarterly, with up to 6 percentage points of the preferred return to be paid through the issuance of additional units or cash, at our election. The units have both call and put rights and are also subject to various covenants including a minimum book value, which if not satisfied, could allow for the securities to be put back to the subsidiary. In March 2020, the subsidiary issued an additional 50.0 million Class B preferred units under the same terms. A holder of the Class B preferred units may, at its election and with notice, require the Company to redeem part or all of such holder s Class B preferred units for cash at 1.00 per unit, on or after October 14, 2024. The proceeds from the transaction were used for general corporate purposes. The Company has the right to redeem the Class B preferred units at any time with notice. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we redeemed 25.5 million of the Class B preferred units at 1.00 per unit plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon. We have included the issuance of these Class B preferred units as temporary noncontrolling interest on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Dividends paid on the Class B preferred units are deducted from Net income attributable to controlling interests to derive Net income attributable to common shareholders. See Note 5, "Redeemable Preferred Stock" and Note 11, "Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests Per Common Share" to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. 
 
 On November 26, 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Dove Ventures, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ("Dove"). The agreement provided for a senior secured term loan facility in an amount of up to 40.0 million at any time outstanding. On December 27, 2019, the Company issued 400,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock with an aggregate initial liquidation preference of 40.0 million, in exchange for full satisfaction of the 40.0 million that the Company owed Dove under the Loan and Security Agreement. Dividends on the preferred stock are 6 per annum (cumulative, non-compounding) and are payable as declared, and in preference to any common stock dividends, in cash. The Series A preferred stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. The Company may, at its option, redeem the shares of Series A preferred stock on or after January 1, 2025 at a redemption price equal to 100 per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. At the request of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Series A preferred stock, the Company is required to offer to redeem all of the Series A preferred stock at a redemption price equal to 100 per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, at the option of the holders thereof, on or after January 1, 2024. Upon the election by the holders of a majority of the shares of Series A preferred stock, each share of the Series A preferred stock is convertible into the number of shares of the Company s common stock as is determined by dividing (i) the sum of (a) 100 and (b) any accumulated and unpaid dividends on such share by (ii) an initial conversion price equal to 10 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances to prevent dilution.

At September 30, 2024, we had 308.7 million in unrestricted cash held by our various business subsidiaries. Because the characteristics of our assets and liabilities change, liquidity management is a dynamic process for us, driven by the pricing and maturity of our assets and liabilities. We historically have financed our business through cash flows from operations, asset-backed structured financings and the issuance of debt and equity. Details concerning our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 346.8 million of cash flows from operations compared to our generating 326.7 million of cash flows from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. While payment rates for our consumers stayed consistent, we experienced an increase in cash provided by operating activities principally related to finance and fee collections associated with growing private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables and increased recoveries on charged-off receivables. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 571.0 million of cash in our investing activities, compared to use of 461.0 million of cash in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in cash used is primarily due to marginal increases in the level of net investments in private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables relative to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased 1,981 million in private label and general purpose credit card receivables compared to 1,805 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As we continue to grow our receivables base, we would expect for purchases of new receivables to outpace payments thereon throughout 2025. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 225.3 million of cash in financing activities, compared to our generating 101.2 million of cash in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash generated is primarily due to the issuance of 130.8 million of 2029 Senior Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Offsetting this increase was the repurchase and retirement of common and preferred stock and preferred stock units which totaled 14.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 27.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In both periods, the data reflect borrowings associated with private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables offset by net repayments of amortizing debt facilities as payments are made on the underlying receivables that serve as collateral. As discussed above, we expect to have continued growth in our receivables base and as a result, expect to continue raising additional capital to fund these acquisitions. 

Beyond our immediate financing efforts discussed throughout this Report, we will continue to evaluate debt and equity issuances as a means to fund our investment opportunities. We expect to take advantage of any opportunities to raise additional capital if terms and pricing are attractive to us. Any proceeds raised under these efforts or additional liquidity available to us could be used to fund (1) additional investments in private label credit and general purpose credit card finance receivables as well as the acquisition of credit card receivables portfolios and (2) further repurchases or redemptions of preferred and common stock. Pursuant to share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, we are authorized to repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of our common stock and 500,000 shares of our Series B preferred stock through June 30, 2026. 
 
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 
 We do not currently have any off-balance-sheet arrangements however, we do have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur we refer to these arrangements as contingent commitments. We do not currently expect that these contingent commitments will result in any material amounts being paid by us. See Note 10, "Commitments and Contingencies," to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of these matters. 
 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
 See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies and Consolidated Financial Statement Components," to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, and in some instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current events, and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. However, because future events are inherently uncertain and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. For a description of the Company s critical accounting estimates, refer to Part II, Item 7, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates" in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 4, 2024. There have been no material changes to the information on critical accounting estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 
 Under a shareholders agreement which we entered into with certain shareholders, including David G. Hanna, Frank J. Hanna, III and certain trusts that were Hanna affiliates (1) if one or more of the shareholders accepts a bona fide offer from a third party to purchase more than 50 of the outstanding common stock, each of the other shareholders that is a party to the agreement may elect to sell his shares to the purchaser on the same terms and conditions, and (2) if shareholders that are a party to the agreement owning more than 50 of the common stock propose to transfer all of their shares to a third party, then such transferring shareholders may require the other shareholders that are a party to the agreement to sell all of the shares owned by them to the proposed transferee on the same terms and conditions. 
 
 In June 2007, we entered into a sublease for 1,000 square feet (as later adjusted to 3,100 square feet) of excess office space at our Atlanta headquarters with HBR Capital, Ltd. ("HBR"), a company co-owned by David G. Hanna and his brother Frank J. Hanna, III. Thereafter, we amended the sublease to reduce the subleased space to 600 square feet. We entered into a new lease for our Atlanta headquarters that commenced in June 2022. In connection with this new prime lease, we entered into a new sublease with HBR. The sublease rate per square foot is the same as the rate that we pay under the prime lease. Under the sublease, HBR paid us 95,653 and 62,422 for 2023 and 2022, respectively. The aggregate amount of payments required under the sublease from January 1, 2024 to the expiration of the sublease in May 2025 is 139,000. 
 
 In January 2013, HBR began leasing the services of certain employees from us. HBR reimburses us for the full cost of the employees, based on the amount of time devoted to HBR. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received 584,400 and 415,800, respectively, of reimbursed costs from HBR associated with these leased employees.

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a "smaller reporting company," as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide this information. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act")) was carried out on behalf of Atlanticus Holdings Corporation and our subsidiaries by our management and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer). Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Act) occurred that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Controls 
 
 The Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures or the Company s internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We are involved in various legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business. There are currently no pending legal proceedings that are expected to be material to us. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

An investment in our common stock, preferred stock or other securities involves a number of risks. You should carefully consider each of the risks described below, among others, before deciding to invest in our securities. If any of the following risks develops into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market prices of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
 
 Our Cash Flows and Net Income Are Dependent Upon Payments from Our Investments in Receivables 
 
 The collectability of our investments in receivables is a function of many factors including the criteria used to select who is issued credit, the pricing of the credit products, the lengths of the relationships, general economic conditions, the rate at which consumers repay their accounts or become delinquent, and the rate at which consumers borrow funds. Deterioration in these factors would adversely impact our business. In addition, to the extent we have over-estimated collectability, in all likelihood we have over-estimated our financial performance. Some of these concerns are discussed more fully below. 
 
 Our portfolio of receivables is not diversified and primarily originates from consumers whose creditworthiness is considered less than prime. Historically, we have invested in receivables in one of two ways we have either (i) invested in receivables originated by lenders who utilize our services or (ii) invested in or purchased pools of receivables from other issuers. In either case, substantially all of our receivables are from borrowers represented by credit risks that regulators classify as less than prime. Our reliance on these receivables may in the future negatively impact our performance. 
 
 Economic slowdowns increase our credit losses. During periods of economic slowdown, recession or rapidly rising inflation rates, we generally experience an increase in rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit losses. Our actual rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit losses may be comparatively higher during periods of economic slowdown or recession or rapidly rising inflation rates. 
 
 Because a significant portion of our reported income is based on management s estimates of the future performance of receivables, differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables may cause fluctuations in net income. Significant portions of our reported income (or losses) are based on management s estimates of cash flows we expect to receive on receivables, particularly for such assets that we report based on fair value. The expected cash flows are based on management s estimates of credit losses, payment rates, servicing costs, discount rates and yields earned on credit card receivables. These estimates are based on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. Substantial differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables will occur and cause fluctuations in our net income. For instance, higher than expected rates of delinquencies and losses could cause our net income to be lower than expected. Similarly, levels of loss and delinquency can result in our being required to repay lenders earlier than expected, thereby reducing funds available to us for future growth.

We Are Substantially Dependent Upon Borrowed Funds to Fund Receivables We Purchase 
 
 We finance receivables that we acquire in large part through financing facilities. All of our financing facilities are of finite duration (and ultimately will need to be extended or replaced) and contain financial covenants and other conditions that must be fulfilled in order for funding to be available. The cost and availability of equity and borrowed funds is dependent upon our financial performance, the performance of our industry overall and general economic and market conditions, and at times equity and borrowed funds have been both expensive and difficult to obtain. 
 
 If additional financing facilities are not available in the future on terms we consider acceptable, we will not be able to purchase additional receivables and those receivables may contract in size. 
 
 Capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability, potentially limiting our ability to grow our receivables. From time-to-time, capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability. For example, from 2008 to 2009, the global capital markets were unstable as evidenced by the lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets, significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market and the failure of major financial institutions. These events contributed to worsening general economic conditions that materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial services firms in particular. If similar adverse and volatile market conditions repeat in the future, we and other companies in the financial services sector may have to access, if available, alternative markets for debt and equity capital in order to grow our receivables. 
 
 Moreover, the re-appearance of market conditions similar to those experienced from 2008 through 2009 for any substantial length of time or worsened market conditions could make it difficult for us to borrow money or to extend the maturity of or refinance any indebtedness we may have under similar terms and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. Unfavorable economic and political conditions, including future recessions, political instability, geopolitical turmoil and foreign hostilities, energy disruptions, inflation, disease, pandemics and other serious health events, also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. 
 
 We may in the future have difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may cause us to reduce the volume of receivables we purchase or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Our Financial Performance Is, in Part, a Function of the Aggregate Amount of Receivables That Are Outstanding 
 
 The aggregate amount of outstanding receivables is a function of many factors including purchase rates, payment rates, interest rates, seasonality, general economic conditions, competition from credit card issuers and other sources of consumer financing, access to funding, and the timing and extent of our receivable purchases. 
 
 The recent growth of our investments in private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables may not be indicative of our ability to grow such receivables in the future. Our period-end managed receivables balance for private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables grew to 2,653.8 million at September 30, 2024, from 2,314.6 million at September 30, 2023. The amount of such receivables has fluctuated significantly over the course of our operating history. Furthermore, even if such receivables continue to increase, the rate of such growth could decline. If we cannot manage the growth in receivables effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 
 Reliance upon relationships with a few large retailers in the private label credit operations may adversely affect our revenues and operating results from these operations. Our five largest retail partners accounted for over 75 of our outstanding private label credit receivables as of September 30, 2024. Although we are adding new retail partners on a regular basis, it is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of this operations receivables base and corresponding revenue from a relatively small number of partners in the future. If a significant partner reduces or terminates its relationship with us, these operations revenue could decline significantly and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. 
 
 We Operate in a Heavily Regulated Industry 
 
 Changes in bankruptcy, privacy or other consumer protection laws, or to the prevailing interpretation thereof, may expose us to litigation, adversely affect our ability to collect receivables, or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Similarly, regulatory changes could adversely affect the ability or willingness of lenders who utilize our technology platform and related services to market credit products and services to consumers. Also, the accounting rules that apply to our business are exceedingly complex, difficult to apply and in a state of flux. As a result, how we value our receivables and otherwise account for our business is subject to change depending upon the changes in, and interpretation of, those rules. Some of these issues are discussed more fully below.

Table of Contents 

Reviews and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities under banking and consumer protection laws and regulations may result in changes to our business practices, may make collection of receivables more difficult or may expose us to the risk of fines, restitution and litigation. Our operations and the operations of the issuing banks through which the credit products we service are originated are subject to the jurisdiction of federal, state and local government authorities, including the SEC, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FTC, U.K. banking and licensing authorities, state regulators having jurisdiction over financial institutions and debt origination and collection and state attorneys general. Our business practices and the practices of issuing banks, including the terms of products, servicing and collection practices, are subject to both periodic and special reviews by these regulatory and enforcement authorities. These reviews can range from investigations of specific consumer complaints or concerns to broader inquiries. If as part of these reviews the regulatory authorities conclude that we or issuing banks are not complying with applicable law, they could request or impose a wide range of remedies including requiring changes in advertising and collection practices, changes in the terms of products (such as decreases in interest rates or fees), the imposition of fines or penalties, or the paying of restitution or the taking of other remedial action with respect to affected consumers. They also could require us or issuing banks to stop offering some credit products or obtain licenses to do so, either nationally or in select states. To the extent that these remedies are imposed on the issuing banks that originate credit products using our platform, under certain circumstances we are responsible for the remedies as a result of our indemnification obligations with those banks. We or our issuing banks also may elect to change practices that we believe are compliant with law in order to respond to regulatory concerns. Furthermore, negative publicity relating to any specific inquiry or investigation could hurt our ability to conduct business with various industry participants or to generate new receivables and could negatively affect our stock price, which would adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and would raise our costs of doing business. 
 
 If any deficiencies or violations of law or regulations are identified by us or asserted by any regulator or require us or issuing banks to change any practices, the correction of such deficiencies or violations, or the making of such changes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or business. In addition, whether or not these practices are modified when a regulatory or enforcement authority requests or requires, there is a risk that we or other industry participants may be named as defendants in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations, including consumer protection laws. Any failure to comply with legal requirements by us or the banks that originate credit products utilizing our platform in connection with the issuance of those products, or by us or our agents as the servicer of our accounts, could significantly impair our ability to collect the full amount of the account balances. The institution of any litigation of this nature, or any judgment against us or any other industry participant in any litigation of this nature, could adversely affect our business and financial condition in a variety of ways. 
 
 The regulatory landscape in which we operate is continually changing due to new rules, regulations and interpretations, as well as various legal actions that have been brought against others that have sought to re-characterize certain loans made by federally insured banks as loans made by third parties. If litigation on similar theories were brought against us when we work with a federally insured bank that makes loans and were such an action successful, we could be subject to state usury limits and/or state licensing requirements, loans in such states could be deemed void and unenforceable, and we could be subject to substantial penalties in connection with such loans. 
 
 The case law involving whether an originating lender, on the one hand, or a third party, on the other hand, is the "true lender" of a loan is still developing and courts have come to different conclusions and applied different analyses. The determination of whether a third-party service provider is the "true lender" is significant because third parties risk having the loans they service becoming subject to a consumer s state usury limits. A number of federal courts that have opined on the "true lender" issue have looked to who is the lender identified on the borrower s loan documents. A number of state courts and at least one federal district court have considered a number of other factors when analyzing whether the originating lender or a third party is the "true lender," including looking at the economics of the transaction to determine, among other things, who has the predominant economic interest in the loan being made. If we were re-characterized as a "true lender" with respect to the receivables originated by the banks that utilize our technology platform and other services, such receivables could be deemed to be void and unenforceable in some states, the right to collect finance charges could be affected, and we could be subject to fines and penalties from state and federal regulatory agencies as well as claims by borrowers, including class actions by private plaintiffs. Even if we were not required to change our business practices to comply with applicable state laws and regulations or cease doing business in some states, we could be required to register or obtain lending licenses or other regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on us. If the banks that originate loans utilizing our technology platform were subject to such a lawsuit, they may elect to terminate their relationships with us voluntarily or at the direction of their regulators, and if they lost the lawsuit, they could be forced to modify or terminate such relationships. 
 
 In addition to true lender challenges, a question regarding the applicability of state usury rates may arise when a loan is sold from a bank to a non-bank entity. In Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the federal preemption of state usury laws did not extend to the purchaser of a loan issued by a national bank. In its brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to deny certiorari, the U.S. Solicitor General, joined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), noted that the Second Circuit (Connecticut, New York and Vermont) analysis was incorrect. On remand, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York concluded on February 27, 2017, that New York s state usury law, not Delaware s state usury law, was applicable and that the plaintiff s claims under the FDCPA and state unfair and deceptive acts and practices could proceed. To that end, the court granted Madden s motion for class certification. At this time, it is unknown whether Madden will be applied outside of the defaulted debt context in which it arose. The facts in Madden are not directly applicable to our business, as we do not engage in practices similar to those at issue in Madden. However, to the extent that the holding in Madden is broadened to cover circumstances applicable to our business, or if other litigation on related theories were brought against us or others and were successful, or we otherwise were found to be the "true lender," we could become subject to state usury limits and state licensing laws, in addition to the state consumer protection laws to which we are already subject, in a greater number of states, loans in such states could be deemed void and unenforceable, and we could be subject to substantial penalties in connection with such loans. 
 
 In response to the uncertainty Madden created as to the validity of interest rates of bank-originated loans sold in the secondary market, in May 2020 and June 2020, the OCC and the FDIC, respectively, issued final rules that reaffirmed the "valid when made" doctrine and clarified that when a bank sells, assigns, or otherwise transfers a loan, the interest rates permissible prior to the transfer continue to be permissible following the transfer. In the summer of 2020, a number of state attorneys general filed suits against the OCC and the FDIC, challenging these "valid when made" rules. In February 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered two orders granting summary judgement in favor of the OCC and the FDIC. The court held that the bank regulators had the power to issue the rules reaffirming the "valid when made" doctrine. Although the practical consequences of Madden have diminished since the initial ruling, uncertainty remains in this area of law.

The CFPB recently issued a final rule regarding credit card late fees, which represents a significant departure from the rules that are currently in effect. Absent a successful legal challenge, we expect the rule would have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition for at least the short term and, depending on the effectiveness of our actions taken in response to the rule, potentially over the long term. 
 
 In March 2024, the CFPB published a final rule that would significantly reduce the safe harbor amount for late fees that credit card issuers are authorized to charge. This rule is currently on hold, pending litigation. The rule, if implemented, would: (i) decrease the safe harbor amount for credit card late fees to 8 and eliminate a higher safe harbor dollar amount for subsequent late payments; and (ii) eliminate the annual inflation adjustments that currently exist for the late fee safe harbor dollar amounts. The "safe harbor" dollar amounts referenced in the CFPB s rulemaking refer to the amounts that credit card issuers may charge as late fees under the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the "CARD Act") without reference to the issuer s cost to collect. Under the CARD Act, these safe harbor amounts, since their initial implementation, have been subject to annual adjustment based on changes in the Consumer Price Index, and the safe harbor amounts are currently set at 30 for an initial late fee and 41 for subsequent late fees incurred in one of the next six billing cycles. Accordingly, the 8 safe harbor amount on late fees (and the elimination of the annual inflation-based adjustment thereto) would represent a significant decrease from the current safe harbor amounts. The final rule was slated to become effective on May 14, 2024, subject to any court-imposed injunction resulting from litigation. 
 
 Shortly after the final rule was published, a lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Ft. Worth Division) by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Bankers Association and various other parties, challenging the rule and seeking a preliminary injunction enjoining the rule from becoming effective during the pendency of the litigation. The lawsuit asserts that the rule would ultimately harm those consumers the CFPB is charged with protecting and seeks to have the rule vacated on various grounds, including that the CFPB (i) violated the CARD Act by preventing issuers from collecting reasonable and proportional late fees when cardholders do not pay their bills on time, and (ii) violated the Administrative Procedure Act by promulgating a final rule that is arbitrary and capricious, relying on inappropriate, incomplete and non-public data. An injunction against implementation was entered on May 10, 2024. 
 
 Assuming these legal challenges are not successful and the CFPB s final rule becomes effective, this rule would represent an approximately 75 reduction in the amount of late fees that may be charged under the CARD Act safe harbor. We have already executed on a number of strategies designed to limit the impact of the final rule on us and we continue to evaluate various other mitigating strategies, but it may not be feasible for us to fully implement these strategies in the short term, and these efforts ultimately may not be successful even if and when fully implemented. Moreover, the final rule (and certain of our mitigating strategies) may present other risks and adverse impacts to our business, results of operations and financial condition, which could include, without limitation, the loss of customers due to tightened underwriting standards or negative customer response to higher rates and fees, impacts to customer payment behavior due to decreased incentives to pay, further regulatory action in response to mitigating strategies that may be employed by us or other credit card issuers, adverse impacts to or disputes with our brand partners, strategic non-renewals of certain brand partner relationships that cease to be profitable, and balance sheet impairments, including of goodwill, long-lived assets and other prepaid or intangible assets. 
 
 We support banks that market general purpose credit cards and certain other credit products directly to consumers. We acquire interests in and service the receivables originated by these banks. The banks could determine not to continue the relationship for various business reasons, or their regulators could limit their ability to issue credit cards utilizing our technology platform or to originate some or all of the other products that we service or require the banks to modify those products significantly and could do either with little or no notice. Any significant interruption or change of our bank relationships would result in our being unable to acquire new receivables or develop certain other credit products. Unless we were able to timely replace our bank relationships, such an interruption would prevent us from acquiring newly-originated credit card receivables and growing our investments in private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables. In turn, it would materially adversely impact our business.

The FDIC has issued guidance affecting the banks that utilize our technology platform to market general purpose credit cards and certain other credit products and these or subsequent new rules and regulations could have a significant impact on such credit products. The banks that utilize our technology platform and other services to market general purpose credit cards and certain other credit products are supervised and examined by both the state that charters them and the FDIC. If the FDIC or a state supervisory body considers any aspect of the products originated utilizing our technology platform to be inconsistent with its guidance, the banks may be required to alter or terminate some or all of these products. 
 
 Changes to consumer protection laws or changes in their interpretation may impede collection efforts or otherwise adversely impact our business practices. Federal and state consumer protection laws regulate the creation and enforcement of consumer credit card receivables and other loans. Many of these laws (and the related regulations) are focused on non-prime lenders and are intended to prohibit or curtail industry-standard practices as well as non-standard practices. For instance, Congress enacted legislation that regulates loans to military personnel through imposing interest rate and other limitations and requiring new disclosures, all as regulated by the Department of Defense. Similarly, in 2009 Congress enacted legislation that required changes to a variety of marketing, billing and collection practices, and the Federal Reserve adopted significant changes to a number of practices through its issuance of regulations. While our practices are in compliance with these changes, some of the changes (e.g., limitations on the ability to assess up-front fees) have significantly affected the viability of certain credit products within the U.S. Changes in the consumer protection laws could result in the following: 

receivables not originated in compliance with law (or revised interpretations) could become unenforceable and uncollectible under their terms against the obligors 

we may be required to credit or refund previously collected amounts 

certain fees and finance charges could be limited, prohibited or restricted, reducing the profitability of certain investments in receivables 

certain collection methods could be prohibited, forcing us to revise our practices or adopt more costly or less effective practices 

limitations on our ability to recover on charged-off receivables regardless of any act or omission on our part 

some credit products and services could be banned in certain states or at the federal level 

federal or state bankruptcy or debtor relief laws could offer additional protections to consumers seeking bankruptcy protection, providing a court greater leeway to reduce or discharge amounts owed to us and 

a reduction in our ability or willingness to invest in receivables arising under loans to certain consumers, such as military personnel. 

Material regulatory developments may adversely impact our business and results from operations. 
 
 Our Automobile Lending Activities Involve Risks in Addition to Others Described Herein 
 
 Automobile lending exposes us not only to most of the risks described above but also to additional risks, including the regulatory scheme that governs installment loans and those attendant to relying upon automobiles and their repossession and liquidation value as collateral. In addition, our Auto Finance segment operation acquires loans on a wholesale basis from used car dealers, for which we rely upon the legal compliance and credit determinations by those dealers. 
 
 Funding for automobile lending may become difficult to obtain and expensive. In the event we are unable to renew or replace any Auto Finance segment credit facilities that bear refunding or refinancing risks when they become due, our Auto Finance segment could experience significant constraints and diminution in reported asset values as lenders retain significant cash flows within underlying structured financings or otherwise under security arrangements for repayment of their loans. If we cannot renew or replace future facilities or otherwise are unduly constrained from a liquidity perspective, we may choose to sell part or all of our auto loan portfolios, possibly at less than favorable prices. 
 
 Our automobile lending business is dependent upon referrals from dealers. Currently we provide substantially all of our automobile loans only to or through used car dealers. Providers of automobile financing have traditionally competed based on the interest rate charged, the quality of credit accepted and the flexibility of loan terms offered. In order to be successful, we not only need to be competitive in these areas, but also need to establish and maintain good relations with dealers and provide them with a level of service greater than what they can obtain from our competitors. 
 
 The financial performance of our automobile loan portfolio is in part dependent upon the liquidation of repossessed automobiles. In the event of certain defaults, we may repossess automobiles and sell repossessed automobiles at wholesale auction markets located throughout the U.S. Auction proceeds from these types of sales and other recoveries generally are not sufficient to cover the outstanding balances of the contracts where we experience these shortfalls, we will experience credit losses. 
 
 Repossession of automobiles entails the risk of litigation and other claims. Although we have contracted with reputable repossession firms to repossess automobiles on defaulted loans, it is not uncommon for consumers to assert that we were not entitled to repossess an automobile or that the repossession was not conducted in accordance with applicable law. These claims increase the cost of our collection efforts and, if successful, can result in awards against us.

We Routinely Explore Various Opportunities to Grow Our Business, to Make Investments and to Purchase and Sell Assets 
 
 We routinely consider acquisitions of, or investments in, portfolios and other assets as well as the sale of portfolios and portions of our business. There are a number of risks attendant to any acquisition, including the possibility that we will overvalue the assets to be purchased and that we will not be able to produce the expected level of profitability from the acquired business or assets. Similarly, there are a number of risks attendant to sales, including the possibility that we will undervalue the assets to be sold. As a result, the impact of any acquisition or sale on our future performance may not be as favorable as expected and actually may be adverse. 
 
 Portfolio purchases may cause fluctuations in our reported CaaS segment s managed receivables data, possibly reducing the usefulness of this data in evaluating our business. Our reported CaaS segment managed receivables data may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter as a result of recent and future credit card portfolio acquisitions. 
 
 Receivables included in purchased portfolios are likely to have been originated using credit criteria different from the criteria of issuing bank partners that have originated accounts utilizing our technology platform. Receivables included in any particular purchased portfolio may have significantly different delinquency rates and charge-off rates than the receivables previously originated and purchased by us. These receivables also may earn different interest rates and fees as compared to other similar receivables in our receivables portfolio. These variables could cause our reported managed receivables data to fluctuate substantially in future periods making the evaluation of our business more difficult. 
 
 Any acquisition or investment that we make will involve risks different from and in addition to the risks to which our business is currently exposed. These include the risks that we will not be able to integrate and operate successfully new businesses, that we will have to incur substantial indebtedness and increase our leverage in order to pay for the acquisitions, that we will be exposed to, and have to comply with, different regulatory regimes and that we will not be able to apply our traditional analytical framework (which is what we expect to be able to do) in a successful and value-enhancing manner. 
 
 Other Risks of Our Business 
 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our inability to compete successfully would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects. 
 
 We operate in a highly competitive and dynamic industry. We face competition from a variety of players, including those who enable transactions and commerce via digital payments and consumer loans. Our primary competition consists of facilitators and providers of legacy payment and consumer loan methods, such as credit and debit cards, including those provided by card issuing banks technology solutions, including those provided by financial technology or payment companies mobile wallets, such as Apple and PayPal and pay-over-time solutions providers, including Block and Klarna. Consumer lending is a broad and competitive market, and we compete to varying degrees with various platform providers or sources of consumer credit. This can include banks, non-bank lenders, including retail-based lenders, and other financial technology companies. 
 
 Some of our competitors, particularly credit issuing banks, are substantially larger than we are and have longer operating histories than we do, which gives those competitors advantages we do not have, such as more diversified products, a broader consumer and merchant base, greater brand recognition and brand loyalty, the ability to reach more consumers, the ability to cross sell their products, operational efficiencies, the ability to cross-subsidize their offerings through their other business lines, more versatile technology platforms, broad-based local distribution capabilities, and lower-cost funding. In addition, because many of our competitors are large financial institutions that fund themselves through low-cost insured deposits and continue to own the loans that they originate, they have certain revenue and funding opportunities not available to us. Furthermore, our current or potential competitors may be better at developing new products due to their large and experienced data science and engineering teams, who are able to respond more quickly to new technologies. 
 
 Additionally, merchants are increasingly offering other credit and payment options to customers. We expect competition to intensify in the future, both as emerging technologies continue to enter the marketplace and as large financial incumbents increasingly seek to innovate the services that they offer to compete with us. Technological advances and the continued growth of e-commerce activities have increased consumers accessibility to products and services and led to the expansion of competition in digital payment and consumer loan options such as pay-over-time solutions. 
 
 We face competition in areas such as compliance capabilities, commercial financing terms and costs of capital, interest rates and fees (and other financing terms) available to consumers from our bank partners, approval rates, model efficiency, speed and simplicity of loan origination, ease-of-use, marketing expertise, service levels, products and services, technological capabilities and integration, borrower experience, brand and reputation. Furthermore, our existing and potential competitors may decide to modify their pricing and business models to compete more directly with us. Our ability to compete will also be affected by our ability to provide our bank partners with a commensurate or more extensive suite of products than those offered by our competitors. In addition, current or potential competitors, including financial technology lending platforms and existing or potential bank partners, may also acquire or form strategic alliances with one another, which could result in our competitors being able to offer more competitive loan terms due to their access to lower-cost capital. Such acquisitions or strategic alliances among our competitors or potential competitors could also make our competitors more adaptable to a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. To stay competitive, we may need to increase our regulatory compliance expenditures or our ability to compete may be adversely affected.

Our industry is driven by constant innovation. We utilize machine learning, which is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments, our ability to operate profitably could suffer. 
 
 Research, data accumulation and development by other companies may result in AI models that are superior to our AI models or result in products superior to those we develop. Further, technologies, products or services we develop may not be preferred to any existing or newly-developed technologies, products or services. If we are unable to compete with such companies or fail to meet the need for innovation in our industry, the use of our platform could stagnate or substantially decline, or our products could fail to maintain or achieve more widespread market acceptance, which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects. 
 
 Our business and operations may be negatively affected by rising prices and interest rates. Our financial performance and consumers ability to repay indebtedness may be affected by uncertain economic conditions, including inflation, government shutdowns and changing interest rates. Higher inflation increases the costs of goods and services, reduces consumer spending power and may negatively affect our ability to purchase receivables. In 2022, inflation reached a four-decade high and continues to adversely impact the economy. 
 
 The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to combat inflation. Increased interest rates adversely impact the spending levels of consumers and their ability and willingness to borrow money. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations, which may reduce the ability of consumers to remain current on their obligations and, therefore, lead to increased delinquencies, defaults, customer bankruptcies and charge-offs, and decreased recoveries, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Over the last two years, prices for energy and food have been particularly volatile in light of Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting trade restrictions and sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and other countries. These events have increased inflationary pressures. 
 
 The potential for government shutdowns due to Congress' failure to enact an appropriations bill could have a negative impact on the nation's economy and adversely impact both our ability to purchase receivables due to lower economic spending levels and our ability to collect on existing receivables as consumers may have temporary or permanent delays in income. 
 
 We are a holding company with no operations of our own. As a result, our cash flow and ability to service our debt is dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries. The distribution of subsidiary earnings, or advances or other distributions of funds by subsidiaries to us, all of which are subject to statutory and could be subject to contractual restrictions, are contingent upon the subsidiaries cash flows and earnings and are subject to various business and debt covenant considerations. 
 
 We are party to litigation. We are party to certain legal proceedings which include litigation customary for a business of our nature. In each case we believe that we have meritorious defenses or that the positions we are asserting otherwise are correct. However, adverse outcomes are possible in these matters, and we could decide to settle one or more of our litigation matters in order to avoid the ongoing cost of litigation or to obtain certainty of outcome. Adverse outcomes or settlements of these matters could require us to pay damages, make restitution, change our business practices or take other actions at a level, or in a manner, that would adversely impact our business. 
 
 The failure of financial institutions or transactional counterparties could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. During 2023, multiple financial institutions were closed and placed in receivership. Although we did not have any funds deposited with the affected banks, we regularly maintain cash balances with other financial institutions in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. A failure of a depository institution to return deposits could impact access to our invested cash or cash equivalents and could adversely impact our operating liquidity and financial performance. 
 
 Because we outsource account-processing functions that are integral to our business, any disruption or termination of these outsourcing relationships could harm our business. We generally outsource account and payment processing. If these outsourcing relationships were not renewed or were terminated or the services provided to us were otherwise disrupted, we would have to obtain these services from alternate providers. There is a risk that we would not be able to enter into similar outsourcing arrangements with alternate providers on terms that we consider favorable or in a timely manner without disruption of our business.

Failure to keep up with the rapid technological changes in financial services and e-commerce could harm our business. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and lending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of consumers by using technology to support products and services that will satisfy consumer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete with our competitors. Any such failure to adapt to changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 
 If we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, our operations could be disrupted and our reputation may be damaged. We rely heavily on networks and information systems and other technology, that are largely hosted by third parties to support our business processes and activities, including processes integral to the origination and collection of loans and other financial products, and information systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Because information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may be impacted by hosted system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches. These incidents may be caused by failures during routine operations such as system upgrades or user errors, as well as network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, computer hackers, rogue employees or contractors, cyber-attacks by criminal groups, geopolitical events, natural disasters, pandemics, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic events. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to collect payments in a timely manner. We also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to repair or replace networks and information systems. 
 
 Unauthorized or unintentional disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer data could expose us to protracted and costly litigation, and civil and criminal penalties. To conduct our business, we are required to manage, use, and store large amounts of personally identifiable information, consisting primarily of confidential personal and financial data regarding consumers across all operations areas. We also depend on our IT networks and systems, and those of third parties, to process, store, and transmit this information. As a result, we are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws designed to protect this information. Security breaches involving our files and infrastructure could lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. 
 
 We take a number of measures to ensure the security of our hardware and software systems and customer information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect data being breached or compromised. In the past, banks and other financial service providers have been the subject of sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on their information technology. An increasing number of websites have reported breaches of their security. 
 
 If any person, including our employees or those of third-party vendors, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to costly litigation, monetary damages, fines, and/or criminal prosecution. Any unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could subject us to liability under data privacy laws. Further, under credit card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of credit card information that we store, we could be liable to the credit card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. In addition, if we fail to follow credit card industry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines. Security breaches also could harm our reputation, which could potentially cause decreased revenues, the loss of existing merchant credit partners, or difficulty in adding new merchant credit partners. 
 
 Internet and data security breaches also could impede our bank partners from originating loans over the Internet, cause us to lose consumers or otherwise damage our reputation or business. Consumers generally are concerned with security and privacy, particularly on the Internet. As part of our growth strategy, we have enabled lenders to originate loans over the Internet. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is essential to maintaining customer confidence in such products and services offered online. 
 
 Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect our client or consumer application and transaction data transmitted over the Internet. In addition to the potential for litigation and civil penalties described above, security breaches could damage our reputation and cause consumers to become unwilling to do business with our clients or us, particularly over the Internet. Any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Our ability to service our clients needs over the Internet would be severely impeded if consumers become unwilling to transmit confidential information online. 
 
 Also, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and business.

Regulation in the areas of privacy and data security could increase our costs. We are subject to various regulations related to privacy and data security/breach, and we could be negatively impacted by these regulations. For example, we are subject to the Safeguards guidelines under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Safeguards guidelines require that each financial institution develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution s activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. Broad-ranging data security laws that affect our business also have been adopted by several states. 
 
 The California Consumer Privacy Act (the "CCPA") became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers with expanded protections and control over the collection, maintenance, use and sharing of personal information. The CCPA continues to be subject to new regulations and legislative amendments. Although we have implemented a compliance program designed to address obligations under the CCPA, it remains unclear what future modifications will be made or how the CCPA will be interpreted in the future. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. 
 
 In addition, in November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the "CPRA") ballot initiative, which became effective on January 1, 2023. The CPRA established the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the CCPA and CPRA. We anticipate that the CPRA and certain regulations promulgated by the California Privacy Protection Agency will apply to our business and we will work to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations by their effective dates. 
 
 Compliance with these laws regarding the protection of consumer and employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs for us, as well as potentially significant fines and penalties for noncompliance. Further, there are various other statutes and regulations relevant to the direct email marketing, debt collection and text-messaging industries including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The interpretation of many of these statutes and regulations is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply with them may have an adverse impact on our business. 
 
 In addition to the foregoing enhanced data security requirements, various federal banking regulatory agencies, and all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, have enacted data security regulations and laws requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach. Also, federal legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidelines, laws and regulations that, if adopted, could further restrict how we collect, use, share and secure consumer information, possibly impacting some of our current or planned business initiatives. 
 
 Unplanned system interruptions or system failures could harm our business and reputation. Any interruption in the availability of our transactional processing services due to hardware, operating system failures, or system conversion will reduce our revenues and profits. Any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, reduction in our ability to serve our customers, thereby resulting in a loss of revenues. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential consumers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our websites or services, and could permanently harm our reputation. 
 
 Although our systems have been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, and similar events or disruptions. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our systems also are subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, pandemic, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions, delays, and loss of critical data, and result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. 
 
 Climate change and related regulatory responses may impact our business. Climate change as a result of emissions of greenhouse gases is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal and other regulatory responses. We are uncertain of the ultimate impact, either directionally or quantitatively, of climate change and related regulatory responses on our business. The most direct impact is likely to be an increase in energy costs, adversely impacting consumers and their ability to incur and repay indebtedness. 
 
 We elected the fair value option for newly originated assets, effective as of January 1, 2020, and for all remaining assets associated with our private label credit and general purpose credit card platform as of January 1, 2022. We use estimates in determining the fair value of our loans. If our estimates prove incorrect, we may be required to write down the value of these assets, adversely affecting our results of operations. Our ability to measure and report our financial position and results of operations is influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of future events on the basis of information available at the time of the issuance of the financial statements. Further, most of these estimates are determined using Level 3 inputs for which changes could significantly impact our fair value measurements. A variety of factors including, but not limited to, estimated yields on consumer receivables, customer default rates, the timing of expected payments, estimated costs to service the portfolio, interest rates, and valuations of comparable portfolios may ultimately affect the fair values of our loans and finance receivables. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows. Management has processes in place to monitor these judgments and assumptions, but these processes may not ensure that our judgments and assumptions are accurate. 
 
 Our allowances for credit losses are determined based upon both objective and subjective factors and may not be adequate to absorb credit losses. We face the risk that customers will fail to repay their loans in full. Through our analysis of loan performance, delinquency data, charge-off data, economic trends and the potential effects of those economic trends on consumers, we establish allowances for credit losses as an estimate of the expected credit losses inherent within those loans, interest and fees receivable that we do not report at fair value. We determine the necessary allowances for credit losses by analyzing some or all of the following attributes unique to each type of receivable pool: historical loss rates current delinquency and roll-rate trends vintage analyses based on the number of months an account has been in existence the effects of changes in the economy on consumers changes in underwriting criteria and estimated recoveries. These inputs are considered in conjunction with (and potentially reduced by) any unearned fees and discounts that may be applicable for an outstanding loan receivable. Actual losses are difficult to forecast, especially if such losses are due to factors beyond our historical experience or control. As a result, our allowances for credit losses may not be adequate to absorb all credit losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Losses are the largest cost as a percentage of revenues across all of our products. Fraud and customers not being able to repay their loans are both significant drivers of loss rates. If we experienced rising credit or fraud losses this would significantly reduce our earnings and profit margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Risks Relating to an Investment in Our Securities 
 
 The prices of our securities may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell our securities when you want or at prices you find attractive. The prices of our securities on the NASDAQ Global Select Market constantly change. We expect that the market prices of our securities will continue to fluctuate. The market prices of our securities may fluctuate in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following: 

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results 

changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and projections by Atlanticus, securities analysts and investors 

the overall financing environment, which is critical to our value 

changes in interest rates 

inflation and supply chain disruptions 

the operating and stock performance of our competitors 

announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments 

the announcement of enforcement actions or investigations against us or our competitors or other negative publicity relating to us or our industry 

changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), laws, regulations or the interpretations thereof that affect our various business activities and segments 

general domestic or international economic, market and political conditions 

changes in ownership by executive officers, directors and parties related to them who control a majority of our common stock 

additions or departures of key personnel 

the annual yield from distributions on the Series B preferred stock or interest on the 2026 Senior Notes and the 2029 Senior Notes as compared to yields on other financial instruments and 

global pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic). 

In addition, the stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the trading prices of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance. 
 
 Future sales of our common stock or equity-related securities in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings. Sales of significant amounts of our common stock or equity-related securities in the public market or the perception that such sales will occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. Future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, including sales of our common stock in short sale transactions, may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 The shares of Series A preferred stock and Series B p referred stock are senior obligations, rank prior to our common stock with respect to dividends, distributions and payments upon liquidation and have other terms, such as a redemption right, that could negatively impact the value of shares of our common stock. In December 2019, we issued 400,000 shares of Series A preferred stock. The rights of the holders of our Series A preferred stock with respect to dividends, distributions and payments upon liquidation rank senior to similar obligations to our holders of common stock. Holders of the Series A preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends on each share of such stock equal to 6 per annum on the liquidation preference of 100. The dividends on the Series A preferred stock are cumulative and non-compounding and must be paid before we pay any dividends on the common stock. 
 
 Further, the holders of the Series A preferred stock have the right to require us to purchase outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock for an amount equal to 100 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. This redemption right could expose us to a liquidity risk if we do not have sufficient cash resources at hand or are not able to find financing on sufficiently attractive terms to comply with our obligations to repurchase the Series A preferred stock upon exercise of such redemption right. 
 
 In June and July 2021, we issued 3,188,533 shares of Series B preferred stock, for net proceeds of approximately 76.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting expenses and the structuring fee. Additionally, the Company has in the past, and may in the future, issue additional shares of Series B preferred stock pursuant to our "at-the-market" offering program. The rights of the holders of our Series B preferred stock with respect to dividends, distributions and payments upon liquidation rank junior to similar obligations to our holders of Series A preferred stock and senior to similar obligations to our holders of common stock. Holders of the Series B preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends on each share of such stock equal to 7.625 per annum on the liquidation preference of 25.00 per share. The dividends on the Series B preferred stock are cumulative and non-compounding and must be paid before we pay any dividends on the common stock. 
 
 In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of our affairs, the holders of our Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets generally available for distribution to our equity holders and before any payment may be made to holders of our common stock. 
 
 Our obligations to the holders of Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock also could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our common stock.

Table of Contents 

Our outstanding Series A preferred stock has anti-dilution protection that, if triggered, could cause substantial dilution to our then-existing holders of common stock, which could adversely affect our stock price. The document governing the terms of our outstanding Series A preferred stock contains anti-dilution provisions to benefit the holders of such stock. As a result, if we, in the future, issue common stock or other derivative securities, subject to specified exceptions, for a per share price less than the then existing conversion price of the Series A preferred stock, an adjustment to the then current conversion price would occur. This reduction in the conversion price could result in substantial dilution to our then-existing holders of common stock, adversely affecting the price of our common stock. 
 
 In the past, we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock on a regular basis, and an increase in the market price of our common stock, if any, may be the sole source of gain on an investment in our common stock. With the exception of dividends payable on our Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock, we currently plan to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and may not pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of all future dividends on our common stock, if any, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, which retains the right to change our dividend policy at any time. Any decision by our board of directors to declare and pay dividends in the future will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions on dividends imposed by the documents governing the terms of the Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Consequently, appreciation in the market price of our common stock, if any, may be the sole source of gain on an investment in our common stock for the foreseeable future. Holders of the Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends on such stock that are cumulative and non-compounding and must be paid before we pay any dividends on the common stock. 
 
 We have the ability to issue additional preferred stock, warrants, convertible debt and other securities without shareholder approval. Our common stock may be subordinate to additional classes of preferred stock issued in the future in the payment of dividends and other distributions made with respect to common stock, including distributions upon liquidation or dissolution. Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Articles of Incorporation") permit our board of directors to issue preferred stock without first obtaining shareholder approval, which we did in December 2019 when we issued the Series A preferred stock and in June and July 2021 when we issued the Series B preferred stock. Additionally, the Company has in the past, and may in the future, issue additional shares of Series B preferred stock pursuant to our "at-the-market" offering program. If we issue additional classes of preferred stock, these additional securities may have dividend or liquidation preferences senior to the common stock. If we issue additional classes of convertible preferred stock, a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common shareholders interests. We have similar abilities to issue convertible debt, warrants and other equity securities. 
 
 Our executive officers, directors and parties related to them, in the aggregate, control a majority of our common stock and may have the ability to control matters requiring shareholder approval. Our executive officers, directors and parties related to them own a large enough share of our common stock to have an influence on, if not control of, the matters presented to shareholders. As a result, these shareholders may have the ability to control matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as any reclassification, reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and the control of our management and affairs. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, adversely affecting the market price of our common stock. 
 
 The Series B preferred stock rank junior to our Series A preferred stock and all of our indebtedness and other liabilities and are effectively junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Series B preferred stock only after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid and the liquidation preference of the Series A preferred stock has been satisfied. The rights of holders of the Series B preferred stock to participate in the distribution of our assets will rank junior to the prior claims of our current and future creditors, the Series A preferred stock and any future series or class of preferred stock we may issue that ranks senior to the Series B preferred stock. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series on terms determined by our board of directors, and as of September 30, 2024 we had outstanding 400,000 shares of Series A preferred stock and 3,300,704 shares of Series B preferred stock. As of September 30, 2024, we could issue up to 6,299,296 additional shares of preferred stock.

In addition, the Series B preferred stock effectively ranks junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of (as well as any preferred equity interests held by others in) our existing subsidiaries and any future subsidiaries. Our existing subsidiaries are, and any future subsidiaries would be, separate legal entities and have no legal obligation to pay any amounts to us in respect of dividends due on the Series B preferred stock. If we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors and holders of our Series A preferred stock, we may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on any or all of the Series B preferred stock then outstanding. We and our subsidiaries have incurred and may in the future incur substantial amounts of debt and other obligations that will rank senior to the Series B preferred stock. We may incur additional indebtedness and become more highly leveraged in the future, harming our financial position and potentially limiting our cash available to pay dividends. As a result, we may not have sufficient funds remaining to satisfy our dividend obligations relating to our Series B preferred stock if we incur additional indebtedness or issue additional preferred stock that ranks senior to the Series B preferred stock. 
 
 Future offerings of debt or senior equity securities may adversely affect the market price of the Series B preferred stock. If we decide to issue debt or senior equity securities in the future, it is possible that these securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of the Series B preferred stock and may result in dilution to holders of the Series B preferred stock. We and, indirectly, our shareholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we do not know the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings. Thus, holders of the Series B preferred stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of the Series B preferred stock and diluting the value of their holdings in us. 
 
 We may issue additional shares of the Series B preferred stock and additional series of preferred stock that rank on a parity with the Series B preferred stock as to dividend rights, rights upon liquidation or voting rights. We are allowed to issue additional shares of Series B preferred stock and additional series of preferred stock that would rank on a parity with the Series B preferred stock as to dividend payments and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs pursuant to our Articles of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Articles of Amendment Establishing the Series B preferred stock without any vote of the holders of the Series B preferred stock. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series on terms determined by our board of directors, and as of September 30, 2024 we had outstanding 400,000 shares of Series A preferred stock and 3,300,704 shares of Series B preferred stock. As of September 30, 2024, we could issue up to 6,299,296 additional shares of preferred stock. The issuance of additional shares of Series B preferred stock and additional series of parity preferred stock could have the effect of reducing the amounts available to the holders of Series B preferred stock upon our liquidation or dissolution or the winding up of our affairs. It also may reduce dividend payments on the Series B preferred stock if we do not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on all Series B preferred stock outstanding and other classes of stock with equal priority with respect to dividends. 
 
 In addition, although holders of the Series B preferred stock are entitled to limited voting rights with respect to such matters, the holders of the Series B preferred stock will vote separately as a class along with all other outstanding series of our preferred stock that we may issue upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable. As a result, the voting rights of holders of the Series B preferred stock may be significantly diluted, and the holders of such other series of preferred stock that we may issue may be able to control or significantly influence the outcome of any vote. 
 
 Future issuances and sales of parity preferred stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, may cause prevailing market prices for the Series B preferred stock and our common stock to decline and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us. Such issuances may also reduce or eliminate our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. 
 
 Holders of Series B preferred stock have extremely limited voting rights. Holders of Series B preferred stock have limited voting rights. Our common stock is the only class of our securities that carries full voting rights. Voting rights for holders of Series B preferred stock exist primarily with respect to the ability to elect (together with the holders of other outstanding series of our preferred stock, or additional series of preferred stock we may issue in the future and upon which similar voting rights have been or are in the future conferred and are exercisable) two additional directors to our board of directors in the event that six quarterly dividends (whether or not declared or consecutive) payable on the Series B preferred stock are in arrears, and with respect to voting on amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Articles of Amendment Establishing the Series B preferred stock (in some cases voting together with the holders of other outstanding series of our preferred stock as a single class) that materially and adversely affect the rights of the holders of Series B preferred stock (and other series of preferred stock, as applicable) or create additional classes or series of our stock that are senior to the Series B preferred stock, provided that in any event adequate provision for redemption has not been made. Other than in limited circumstances, holders of Series B preferred stock do not have any voting rights. 
 
 The conversion feature of the Series B preferred stock may not adequately compensate holders of such stock, and the conversion and redemption features of the Series B preferred stock may make it more difficult for a party to take over our company and may discourage a party from taking over the Company. Upon the occurrence of a Delisting Event or Change of Control (as defined in the document governing the terms of the Series B preferred stock), holders of the Series B preferred stock will have the right (unless, prior to the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control Conversion Date, as applicable, we have provided or provide notice of our election to redeem the Series B preferred stock) to convert some or all of the Series B preferred stock into our common stock (or equivalent value of alternative consideration), and under these circumstances we will also have a special optional redemption right to redeem the Series B preferred stock. Upon such a conversion, the holders will be limited to a maximum number of shares of our common stock equal to the Share Cap (as defined in the document governing the terms of the Series B preferred stock) multiplied by the number of shares of Series B preferred stock converted. If the common stock price is less than 19.275, subject to adjustment, the holders will receive a maximum of 1.29702 shares of our common stock per share of Series B preferred stock, which may result in a holder receiving value that is less than the liquidation preference of the Series B preferred stock. In addition, those features of the Series B preferred stock may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock and Series B preferred stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price or that shareholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.

Holders of Series B preferred stock may be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to "qualified dividend income." Distributions paid to corporate U.S. holders on the Series B preferred stock may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction, and distributions paid to non-corporate U.S. holders on the Series B preferred stock may be subject to tax at the preferential tax rates applicable to "qualified dividend income," if we have current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although we presently have accumulated earnings and profits, we may not have sufficient current or accumulated earnings and profits during future fiscal years for the distributions on the Series B preferred stock to qualify as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any distributions on the Series B preferred stock with respect to any fiscal year fail to be treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, corporate U.S. holders would be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and non-corporate U.S. holders may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to "qualified dividend income" and generally would be required to reduce their tax basis in the Series B preferred stock by the extent to which the distribution is not treated as a dividend. 
 
 Holders of Series B preferred stock may be subject to tax if we make or fail to make certain adjustments to the conversion rate of the Series B preferred stock even though such holders do not receive a corresponding cash dividend. The conversion rate for the Series B preferred stock is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. A failure to adjust (or to adjust adequately) the conversion rate after an event that increases the proportionate interest of the Series B preferred stock holders in us could be treated as a deemed taxable dividend to you. If a holder is a non-U.S. holder, any deemed dividend may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30 rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty, which may be set off against subsequent payments on the Series B preferred stock. In April 2016, the U.S. Treasury issued proposed income tax regulations in regard to the taxability of changes in conversion rights that will apply to the Series B preferred stock when published in final form and may be applied to us before final publication in certain instances. 
 
 The indenture governing the 2026 Senior Notes and the 2029 Senior Notes does not prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization or dissolution. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to holders of 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. Incurrence of additional debt would also further reduce the cash available to invest in operations, as a result of increased debt service obligations. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. 
 
 Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, because: 

it could affect our ability to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes 

a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations would have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes 

it may impair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future 

it may limit our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 

it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry and 

it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general. 

Our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. If we fail to make a payment on the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, we could be in default on the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, and this default could cause us to be in default on other indebtedness, to the extent outstanding. Conversely, a default under any other indebtedness, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under the related agreement and entitle the holders thereof to bring suit for the enforcement thereof or exercise other remedies provided thereunder. In addition, such default or acceleration may result in an event of default and acceleration of other indebtedness, entitling the holders thereof to bring suit for the enforcement thereof or exercise other remedies provided thereunder. If a judgment is obtained by any such holders, such holders could seek to collect on such judgment from the assets of Atlanticus. If that should occur, we may not be able to pay all such debt or to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. 
 
 However, no event of default under the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes would result from a default or acceleration of, or suit, other exercise of remedies or collection proceeding by holders of, our other outstanding debt, if any. As a result, all or substantially all of our assets may be used to satisfy claims of holders of our other outstanding debt, if any, without the holders of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes having any rights to such assets. 
 
 The 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness that we currently have or that we may incur in the future. The 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes are not secured by any of our assets or any of the assets of our subsidiaries. As a result, the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness that we or our subsidiaries have currently outstanding or may incur in the future to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The indenture governing the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes does not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional secured (or unsecured) indebtedness in the future. In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries may assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness and may consequently receive payment from these assets before they may be used to pay other creditors, including the holders of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes.

Table of Contents 

The 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. The 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes are obligations exclusively of Atlanticus and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is a guarantor of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, and the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we may acquire or create in the future. Therefore, in any bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, all claims of creditors (including trade creditors) of our subsidiaries will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. Consequently, the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish as financing vehicles or otherwise. The indenture governing the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes does not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness in the future or granting liens on our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries to secure any such additional indebtedness. In addition, future debt and security agreements entered into by our subsidiaries may contain various restrictions, including restrictions on payments by our subsidiaries to us and the transfer by our subsidiaries of assets pledged as collateral. 
 
 The indenture governing the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes contains limited protection for holders of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. The indenture under which the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes were issued offers limited protection to holders of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. The terms of the indenture and the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes do not restrict our or any of our subsidiaries ability to engage in, or otherwise be a party to, a variety of corporate transactions, circumstances or events that could have an adverse impact on the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. In particular, the terms of the indenture and the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes do not place any restrictions on our or our subsidiaries ability to: 

issue debt securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, including (1) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be equal in right of payment to the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, (2) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured and therefore rank effectively senior in right of payment to the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness or other obligations, (3) indebtedness of ours that is guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries and which therefore would be structurally senior to the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes and (4) securities, indebtedness or obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior to our equity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore rank structurally senior to the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes with respect to the assets of our subsidiaries 

pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities subordinated in right of payment to the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes 

sell assets (other than certain limited restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets) 

enter into transactions with affiliates 

create liens (including liens on the shares of our subsidiaries) or enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

make investments or 

create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our subsidiaries. 

In addition, the indenture does not include any protection against certain events, such as a change of control, a leveraged recapitalization or "going private" transaction (which may result in a significant increase of our indebtedness levels), restructuring or similar transactions. Furthermore, the terms of the indenture and the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes do not protect holders of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes in the event that we experience changes (including significant adverse changes) in our financial condition, results of operations or credit ratings, as they do not require that we or our subsidiaries adhere to any financial tests or ratios or specified levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flow, or liquidity. Also, an event of default or acceleration under our other indebtedness would not necessarily result in an "event of default" under the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. 
 
 Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture may have important consequences for holders of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes or negatively affecting the trading value of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. 
 
 Other debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its holders than the indenture and the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, including additional covenants and events of default. The issuance or incurrence of any such debt with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels and prices of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes.

Table of Contents 

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such indebtedness, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance and that of our subsidiaries, which, in turn, will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial and business factors, many of which may be beyond our control. 
 
 We may not maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity capital or restructure our debt. In the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on, and principal of, our debt, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those sales, or if we do, at an opportune time, the proceeds that we realize may not be adequate to meet debt service obligations when due. Repayment of our indebtedness, to a certain degree, is also dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries (none of which are guarantors of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes) and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions or other payments to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, applicable U.S. and foreign legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required payments on our indebtedness. 
 
 An increase in market interest rates could result in a decrease in the value of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. In general, as market interest rates rise, notes bearing interest at a fixed rate decline in value. Consequently, if market interest rates increase, the market value of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes may decline. 
 
 We may issue additional notes. Under the terms of the indenture governing the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, we may from time to time without notice to, or the consent of, the holders of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, create and issue additional notes which may rank equally with the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. If any such additional notes are not fungible with the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes initially offered hereby for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such additional notes will have one or more separate CUSIP numbers. 
 
 The ratings for the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes could at any time be revised downward or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency. Ratings only reflect the views of the issuing rating agency or agencies and such ratings could at any time be revised downward or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. Ratings do not reflect market prices or suitability of a security for a particular investor and the ratings of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes may not reflect all risks related to us and our business, or the structure or market value of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. We may elect to issue other securities for which we may seek to obtain a rating in the future. If we issue other securities with a rating, such ratings, if they are lower than market expectations or are subsequently lowered or withdrawn, could adversely affect the market for or the market value of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. 
 
 Note Regarding Risk Factors 
 
 The risk factors presented above are all of the ones that we currently consider material. However, they are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not presently known to us, or which we currently consider immaterial, also may adversely affect us. There may be risks that a particular investor views differently from us, and our analysis might be wrong. If any of the risks that we face actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and could differ materially from any possible results suggested by any forward-looking statements that we have made or might make. In such case, the trading price of our common stock or other securities could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

 On May 7, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of our Series B preferred stock through June 30, 2026. 

We will continue to evaluate our common stock price and Series B preferred stock price relative to other investment opportunities and, to the extent we believe that the repurchase of our common stock or Series B preferred stock represents an appropriate return of capital, we will repurchase shares of our common stock or Series B preferred stock. 
 Dividends 
 
 We have no current plans to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. As we continue to pursue our growth strategy, we will assess our cash flow, the long-term capital needs of our business and other uses of cash. Payment of any cash dividends in the future will depend upon, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and contractual restrictions. Furthermore, dividends on our Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock are payable in preference to any common stock dividends. We pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series A preferred stock, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, in the amount of 6 of the 100.00 liquidation preference per share annually. We pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series B preferred stock, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, in the amount of 1.90625 per share each year, which is equivalent to 7.625 of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share.
