In connection with the acquisition of the Initial Portfolio, Barings conducted certain valuation procedures to confirm whether there had been any material changes to the fair value of the investments and obligations in the Initial Portfolio from the previously determined fair value thereof and concluded that no purchase price adjustments were necessary given the absence of any such material changes.

 of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time if in its reasonable judgment if it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest of the Company s stockholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect its operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Exchange Act Rule 13e-4 and the 1940 Act and subject to compliance with applicable covenants and restrictions under the Company s financing arrangements. All shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be redeemed and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under the Company s discretionary share repurchase program, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, it expects to repurchase shares pursuant to quarterly tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter (the Valuation Date ). Stockholders who purchase shares of the Company s common stock on or after March 1, 2024 should keep in mind that if they tender their shares of common stock in a tender offer with a Valuation Date that is within the period following the initial issue date of their tendered shares, the Company may repurchase such shares subject to an early repurchase deduction of of the aggregate NAV of the shares repurchased (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining holders of the Company s common stock. This Early Repurchase Deduction will also generally apply to minimum account repurchases. The Company may, from time to time, waive the Early Repurchase Deduction in the following circumstances, subject to certain conditions: re purchases resulting from death, qualifying disability or divorce; in the event of a stockholders shares are repurchased because the stockholder has failed to maintain the minimum account balance; or due to trade or operational error.

 of the Company s average gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage but excluding (i) cash and cash equivalents (as defined below) and (ii) net unsettled purchases and sales of investments. For services rendered under the Advisory Agreement, the Base Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears on a calendar quarter basis. The Base Management Fee is calculated based on the average value of the Company s gross assets (excluding (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) net unsettled purchases and sales of investments) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters prior to the quarter for which such fees are being calculated; provided, that upon the end of the first calendar quarter following the Initial Closing, the Base Management Fee is calculated based on the value of the Company s gross assets (excluding (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) net unsettled purchases and sales of investments) as of such calendar quarter-end; provided further, that upon the end of the second calendar quarter following the Initial Closing, the Base Management Fee is calculated based on the average value of the Company s gross assets (excluding (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) net unsettled purchases and sales of investments) at the end of each of the first two calendar quarters following the Initial Closing (including the quarter for which such fees are being calculated). 
 The Base Management Fee for any partial quarter will be appropriately pro-rated.

As of December 31, 2023, the Base Management Fee of million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was unpaid and included in Base management fees payable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 The Incentive Fee 
 The Incentive Fee under the Advisory Agreement is based on the Company s income, as described below. 
 No portion of the Incentive Fee is payable until the completion of the first full calendar quarter following the anniversary of the initial effective date of the Advisory Agreement, May 13, 2021 (the Initial Effective Date ). Upon the completion of the first full calendar quarter following the one-year anniversary of the Initial Effective Date and thereafter, the Incentive Fee is determined and paid quarterly in arrears based on the amount by which (x) the aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below) in respect of the then-current calendar quarter and the three preceding calendar quarters (the Trailing Twelve Months ), exceeds (y) the Hurdle Amount (as defined below) in respect of the Trailing Twelve Months. The Hurdle Amount is determined on a quarterly basis, and is calculated by multiplying by the average of the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Months. For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including, without limitation, any accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash and any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses accrued during the calendar quarter (including, without limitation, the Base Management Fee, administration expenses and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). For the avoidance of doubt, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 The calculation of the Incentive Fee for each quarter will be as follows: 
 No Incentive Fee will be payable to the Adviser in any calendar quarter in which the Company s aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Months does not exceed the Hurdle Amount; 
 of the Company s aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Months, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Amount but is less than or equal to an amount (the Catch-Up Amount determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying by the average of the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Months. The Catch-Up Amount is intended to provide the Adviser with an Incentive Fee of on all of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income when the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income reaches the Catch-Up Amount for the Trailing Twelve Months; and 
 For any quarter in which the Company s aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Months exceeds the Catch-Up Amount, the Incentive Fee will equal of the amount of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such Trailing Twelve Months, as the Hurdle Amount and Catch-Up Amount will have been achieved. 
 Subject to the Incentive Fee Cap (discussed below), the amount of the Incentive Fee that will be paid to Barings for a particular quarter will equal the aggregate Incentive Fee calculated as set forth above, less the aggregate Incentive Fees that were paid to Barings in the preceding three calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Months. 
 The Incentive Fee is subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap ). The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is an amount equal to (x) of the average value of the Company s gross assets (excluding (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) net unsettled purchases and sales of investments) at the end of each quarter during the Trailing Twelve Months and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the period (the Average TTM Gross Assets ), or (y) in the event that the Company s Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Months is less than , the Incentive Fee Cap will equal of the Average TTM Gross Assets; provided that, if the Incentive Fee Cap as calculated in clause (x) of this paragraph applies in any quarter, in no event will the Company pay any incentive fee (or portion thereof) during such quarter to the extent that it would cause the Cumulative Net Investor Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Months to be reduced to an amount below what the Cumulative Net Investor Return during such period would have been if the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter had been calculated in accordance with clause (y) of this paragraph .

The total equity invested in Rocade as of September 30, 2024 was million (excluding preferred dividends) and the Company had million of unfunded preferred equity commitments. Rocade conducts its business through Rocade LLC and operates as Rocade Capital. Rocade is one of the country s leading litigation finance platforms that specializes in providing financing to plaintiff law firms engaged in mass tort and other civil litigation.

The loans generally bear floating rate PIK interest with an overall expected annualized return between and and collect debt service upon receipt of settlement awards and/or contingency fees. The addition of Rocade to the portfolio allows the Company to participate in an uncorrelated asset class that offer differentiated income returns as compared to directly originated loans. Rocade is led by a seasoned team of litigation finance experts. 
 The Company has determined that Rocade is not an investment company under ASC Topic 946, Financial Services - Investment Companies. Under ASC 810-10-15-12(d), an investment company generally does not consolidate an investee that is not an investment company other than a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the company. Thus, the Company is not required to consolidate Rocade because it does not provide services to the Company. Instead, the Company accounts for its equity investment in Rocade in accordance with ASC 946-320, presented as a single investment measured at fair value. 
 Valuation of Investments 
 The Adviser conducts the valuation of the Company s investments, upon which the Company s NAV is primarily based, in accordance with its valuation policy, as well as established and documented processes and methodologies for determining the fair values of portfolio company investments on a recurring (at least quarterly) basis in accordance with the 1940 Act and FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC Topic 820 ). The Company s current valuation policy and processes were established by the Adviser and were approved by the Board. 
 Under ASC Topic 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller at the measurement date. For the Company s portfolio securities, fair value is generally the amount that the Company might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security. The fair value measurement assumes that the sale occurs in the principal market for the security, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the security. If no market for the security exists or if the Company does not have access to the principal market, the security should be valued based on the sale occurring in a hypothetical market. 
 Under ASC Topic 820, there are three levels of valuation inputs, as follows: 
 Level 1 Inputs include quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2 Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
 Level 3 Inputs include inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 
 A financial instrument is categorized within the ASC Topic 820 valuation hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input to the valuation process that is significant to the fair value measurement. For example, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3). Therefore, unrealized appreciation and

 All realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation are included in earnings (changes in net assets) and are reported on separate line items within the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. Pre-tax net unrealized depreciation on Level 3 investments of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to portfolio company investments that were still held by the Company as of September 30, 2024. Pre-tax net unrealized appreciation on Level 3 investments of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was related to portfolio company investments that were still held by the Company as of September 30, 2023. 
 Exclusive of short-term investments, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made investments of approximately million in portfolio companies to which it was not previously contractually committed to provide such financing. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made investments of million in portfolio companies to which it was previously committed to provide such financing. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company made investments of approximately million in portfolio companies to which it was not previously contractually committed to provide such financing. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company made investments of million in portfolio companies to which it was previously committed to provide such financing. 
 Unsettled Purchases and Sales of Investments 
 Investment transactions are recorded based on the trade date of the transaction. As a result, unsettled purchases and sales are recorded as payables and receivables from unsettled transactions, respectively. While purchase and sales of the Company s syndicated senior secured loans generally settle on a T+7 basis, the settlement period will sometimes extend past the scheduled settlement. In such cases, the Company generally is contractually owed and recognizes interest income equal to the applicable margin spread beginning on the T+7 date. Such income is accrued as interest receivable and is collected upon settlement of the investment transaction. 
 Realized Gain or Loss and Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation of Portfolio Investments 
 Realized gains or losses are recorded upon the sale or liquidation of investments and are calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or liquidation, if any, and the cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the difference between the fair value of the investments and the cost basis of the investments. 
 Investment Classification 
 In accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Company classifies investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, Control Investments are investments in those companies that the Company is deemed to Control. Affiliate Investments are investments in those companies that are Affiliated Persons of the Company, as defined in the 1940 Act, 
 
 87 

Barings Private Credit Corporation 
 Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

 and portfolio companies, respectively, with investments that were on non-accrual. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity is recorded on the ex-dividend date. 
 Payment-in-Kind Interest 
 The Company currently holds, and expects to hold in the future, some loans in its portfolio that contain PIK interest provisions. PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the loan, rather than being paid to the Company in cash, and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of PIK interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. 
 PIK interest, which is a non-cash source of income at the time of recognition, is included in the Company s taxable income and therefore affects the amount the Company is required to distribute to its stockholders to maintain its tax treatment as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash. Generally, when current cash interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if the Company otherwise does not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, the Company will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing PIK interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. The Company writes off any accrued and uncollected PIK interest when it is determined that the PIK interest is no longer collectible. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had portfolio company that was current on interest payments and on partial non-accrual status for PIK purposes only.

 Other general and administrative expenses include Board fees, directors and officers insurance costs, legal and accounting expenses, expenses reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement and other costs related to operating the Company. 
 Deferred Financing Fees 
 Costs incurred to issue debt are capitalized and are amortized over the term of the debt agreements using the effective interest method. 
 Segments 
 The Company lends to and invests in customers in various industries. The Company separately evaluates the performance of each of its lending and investment relationships. However, because each of these loan and investment relationships has similar business and economic characteristics, they have been aggregated into a single lending and investment segment. All applicable segment disclosures are included in or can be derived from the Company s financial statements. 
 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no individual investments representing greater than 10 of the fair value of the Company s portfolio. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s largest single portfolio company investment, excluding short-term investments, represented approximately and , respectively, of the fair value of the Company s portfolio. Income, consisting of interest, dividends, fees, other investment income and realization of gains or losses on equity interests, can fluctuate dramatically upon repayment of an investment or sale of an equity interest and in any given year can be highly concentrated among several portfolio companies. 
 As of September 30, 2024, all of BPC Funding LLC s BPC Funding assets were pledged (or will be pledged when the related investment purchase settles) as collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility.

 investments that were denominated in Australian dollars, investments that were denominated in Canadian dollars, investment that was denominated in Danish kroner, investments that were denominated in Euros, investments that were denominated in Swiss francs, investments that were denominated in Swedish kronor, investments that were denominated in New Zealand dollars, investment that was denominated in Norwegian kroner and investments that were denominated in British pounds sterling. As of December 31, 2023, the Company held investments that were denominated in Australian dollars, investments that were denominated in Canadian dollars, investment that was denominated in Danish kroner, investments that were denominated in Euros, investments that were denominated in Swiss francs, investments that were denominated in Swedish kronor, investments that were denominated in New Zealand dollars, investment that was denominated in Norwegian kroner and investments that were denominated in British pounds sterling. 
 At each balance sheet date, portfolio company investments denominated in foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using the spot exchange rate on the last business day of the period. Purchases and sales of foreign portfolio company investments, and any income from such investments, are translated into United States dollars using the rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. 
 Although the fair values of foreign portfolio company investments and the fluctuation in such fair values are translated into United States dollars using the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, the Company does not separately report that portion of the change in fair values resulting from foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations from the change in fair values of the underlying investment. All fluctuations in fair value are included in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 In addition, during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company entered into forward currency contracts primarily to help mitigate the impact that an adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have on the Company s investments denominated in foreign currencies. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on foreign currency contracts are included in Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) forward currency contracts and net realized gains or losses on forward currency contracts are included in Net realized gains (losses) forward currency contracts in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Investments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with those of domestic origin, including unanticipated movements in the value of the foreign currency relative to the U.S. Dollar.

 million and million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded net expenses of million and million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax. 
 Tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns are evaluated to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Management has analyzed the Company s tax positions taken, or to be taken, on federal income tax returns for all open tax years (fiscal years 2021-2022), and has concluded that the provision for uncertain tax positions in the Company s financial statements is appropriate. 
 Taxable income generally differs from increase in net assets resulting from operations due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized gains or losses, as unrealized gains or losses are generally not included in taxable income until they are realized. The Company makes certain adjustments to the classification of net assets as a result of permanent book-to-tax differences, which include differences in the book and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities, and nondeductible federal taxes or losses among other items. To the extent these differences are permanent, they are charged or credited to additional paid in capital, or total distributable earnings (loss), as appropriate. 
 For federal income tax purposes, the cost of investments owned as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, net unrealized appreciation on the Company s investments (tax basis) was approximately million, consisting of gross unrealized appreciation, where the fair value of the Company s investments exceeds their tax cost, of approximately million and gross unrealized depreciation, where the tax cost of the Company s investments exceeds their fair value, of approximately million. As of December 31, 2023, net unrealized depreciation on the Company s investments (tax basis) was approximately million, consisting of gross unrealized appreciation, where the fair value of the Company s investments exceeds their tax cost, of approximately million and gross unrealized depreciation, where the tax cost of the Company s investments exceeds their fair value, of approximately million. 
 In addition, the Company has a wholly-owned taxable subsidiary (the Taxable Subsidiary ), which holds certain portfolio investments that are listed on the Unaudited and Audited Consolidated Schedules of Investments. The Taxable Subsidiary is consolidated for financial reporting purposes, such that the Company s consolidated financial statements reflect the Company s investments in the portfolio companies owned by the Taxable Subsidiary. The purpose of the Taxable Subsidiary is to permit the Company to hold certain portfolio companies that are organized as limited liability companies LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities) and still satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90 of the RIC s gross revenue for income tax purposes must consist of qualifying investment income. Absent the Taxable Subsidiary, a proportionate amount of any gross income of an LLC (or other pass-through entity) portfolio investment would flow through directly to the RIC. To the extent that such income did not consist of qualifying investment income, it could jeopardize the Company s ability to qualify as a RIC and therefore cause the Company to incur significant amounts of federal income taxes. When LLCs (or other pass-through entities) are owned by the Taxable Subsidiary, their income is taxed to the Taxable Subsidiary and does not flow through to the RIC, thereby helping the Company preserve its RIC tax treatment and resultant tax advantages. The Taxable Subsidiary is not consolidated for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense or benefit as a result of its ownership of the portfolio companies. This income tax expense or benefit, if any, is reflected in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, any unrealized appreciation related to portfolio investments held by the Taxable Subsidiary (net of unrealized depreciation related to portfolio investments held by the Taxable Subsidiary), is reflected net of applicable federal and state income taxes, if any, in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations, with the related deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the Company s Unaudited and Audited Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a net deferred tax liability of million and million, respectively, pertaining to operating losses and tax basis differences related to certain partnership interests.

 The Company is required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of the Company s total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to its outstanding senior securities, of at least 150 after each issuance of senior securities. The Company s asset coverage ratio was as of September 30, 2024. 
 BNP Paribas Revolving Credit Facility 
 On May 11, 2021, BPC Funding, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into the Revolving Credit Facility with BNP Paribas BNPP ). BNPP serves as administrative agent, State Street Bank and Trust Company serves as collateral agent, and the Company serves as servicer under the Revolving Credit Facility.

 to per annum depending on the nature of the advances being requested under the Revolving Credit Facility. Effective on March 9, 2022, the term SOFR reference rate replaced LIBOR as an applicable index for U.S. dollar-based borrowings. Effective March 9, 2022, U.S. dollar advances under the Revolving Credit Agreement bore interest at a per annum rate equal to three-month term SOFR, plus an applicable margin of to per annum depending on the nature of the advances being requested under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Commencing on May 9, 2024, advances under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, in the case of dollar advances, Term SOFR based upon the applicable interest accrual period, and in the case of foreign currency advances, the applicable benchmark in effect for such currency, plus an applicable margin of (1) during the reinvestment period, and (2) following the reinvestment period, . 
 Under the Revolving Credit Facility, BPC Funding pays an unused fee based on the average daily unused amount of the financing commitments, in addition to certain other fees as agreed between BPC Funding and BNPP. Commencing on September 9, 2022, BPC Funding paid an unused fee of per annum if the unused facility amount was greater than 50 , or per annum if the unused facility amount was less than or equal to 50 and greater than 25 , based on the average daily unused amount of the financing commitments, in addition to certain other fees as agreed between BPC Funding and BNPP. Commencing on May 9, 2024, BPC Funding pays an unused fee, based on the average daily unused amount of the financing commitments, in an amount not to exceed (1) per annum for the period up to and including March 31, 2025, and (2) per annum for the period after March 31, 2025, in addition to certain other fees as agreed between BPC Funding and BNPP. 
 Advances under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to compliance with borrowing base requirements, pursuant to which the amount of funds advanced by the lenders to BPC Funding varies depending upon the types of assets in BPC Funding s portfolio. Assets are required to meet certain criteria in order to be included in the borrowing base, and the borrowing base is subject to certain portfolio restrictions including investment size, sector concentrations and investment type. 
 Proceeds from borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used to fund portfolio investments by BPC Funding, to make advances under delayed draw term loans and revolving loans for which BPC Funding is a lender, and to make permitted distributions. The expiration date for the period during which BPC Funding may borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility is May 11, 2027, and the scheduled maturity date under the Revolving Credit Agreement is May 11, 2029. 
 BPC Funding s obligations to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in all of BPC Funding s portfolio investments and cash. The obligations of BPC Funding under the Revolving Credit Facility are non-recourse to the Company, and the Company s exposure under the Revolving Credit Facility is limited to the value of the Company s investment in BPC Funding. 
 In connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, BPC Funding has made certain customary representations and warranties and is required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar facilities. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default for similar financing transactions, including if a change of control of BPC Funding occurs. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, BNPP may declare the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility immediately due and payable. The occurrence of an event of default triggers a requirement that BPC Funding obtain the consent of BNPP prior to entering into any sale or disposition with respect to portfolio investments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had U.S. dollar borrowings of million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility with a weighted average interest rate of (three month SOFR of ), borrowings denominated in British pounds sterling of million million U.S. dollars) with a weighted average interest rate of (weighted average three month adjusted cumulative compounded SONIA of ), borrowings denominated in Australian dollars of A million million U.S. dollars) with an interest rate of (three month BBSW of ), borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars of C million million U.S. dollars) with an interest rate of (three month CDOR of ), borrowings denominated in New Zealand dollars of NZ million million U.S. dollars) with an interest rate of (three month NZBB of and borrowings denominated in Euros of million million U.S. dollars) with a weighted average interest rate of (three month EURIBOR of ).

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, including a brief discussion of our business, key factors that impacted our performance and a summary of our operating results. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Some of the statements in this Quarterly Report constitute forward-looking statements because they relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition. Forward-looking statements may include, among other things, statements as to our future operating results, our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies, the impact of the investments that we expect to make, the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives, our expected financings and investments, the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital, and the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies. Words such as expect, anticipate, target, goals, project, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, continue, forecast, may, should, potential, variations of such words, and similar expressions indicate a forward-looking statement, although not all forward-looking statements include these words. Readers are cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report are only predictions, are not guarantees of future performance, and are subject to risks, events, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Our actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the items discussed herein, in Item 1A titled Risk Factors in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Item 1A titled Risk Factors in Part II of our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or in other reports that we may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC from time to time. Other factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially include, but are not limited to, changes in political, economic or industry conditions, including the risks of a slowing economy, rising inflation and risk of recession, and volatility in the financial services sector, including bank failures; the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets; the impact of global health crises on our or our portfolio companies business and the U.S. and global economies; our, or our portfolio companies , future business, operations, operating results or prospects; risks associated with possible disruption due to terrorism in our operations or the economy generally; and future changes in laws or regulations and conditions in our or our portfolio companies operating areas. These statements are based on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts, information and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management as of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless we are required to do so by law. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. 
 Overview of Our Business 
 We were formed on April 2, 2021 as a Maryland limited liability company named Barings Private Credit LLC and converted to a Maryland corporation named Barings Private Credit Corporation effective on May 13, 2021, in connection with the commencement of our operations. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ), and are externally managed by Barings LLC Barings or the Adviser ), an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ). In addition, we have elected for federal income tax purposes to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and expect to maintain our qualification as a RIC annually thereafter. 
 An externally-managed BDC generally does not have any employees, and its investment and management functions are provided by an outside investment adviser and administrator under an advisory agreement and administration agreement. Instead of directly compensating employees, we pay Barings for investment management and administrative services pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated investment advisory agreement Advisory Agreement and an administration agreement Administration Agreement ). 
 
 108 

We are a non-exchange traded, privately offered perpetual-life BDC, which is a BDC whose shares are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or other securities market. We use the term privately offered perpetual-life BDC to describe an investment vehicle of indefinite duration, whose shares of common stock are intended to be sold by the BDC on a continuous basis in private offerings at a price equal to the BDC s net asset value NAV per share. 
 Our primary investment objective is to generate current income by investing directly in privately-held middle-market companies to help these companies fund acquisitions, growth or refinancing. We focus on investing primarily in senior secured private debt instruments in well-established middle-market businesses that operate across a wide range of industries. To a lesser extent, we will invest opportunistically in assets such as, without limitation, equity, special situations, structured credit (e.g., private asset-backed securities), syndicated loan opportunities, high-yield investments and/or mortgage securities . Barings employs fundamental credit analysis, and targets investments in businesses with low levels of cyclicality (i.e., the risk of business cycles or other economic cycles adversely affecting them) and operating risk relative to other businesses in this market segment. The holding size of each position will generally be dependent upon a number of factors including total facility size, pricing and structure, and the number of other lenders in the facility. Barings has experience managing levered vehicles, both public and private, and seeks to enhance our returns through the use of leverage with a prudent approach that prioritizes capital preservation. Barings believes this strategy and approach offers attractive risk/return with lower volatility given the potential for fewer defaults and greater resilience through market cycles. A significant portion of our investments are expected to be rated below investment grade by rating agencies or, if unrated, would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. 
 Formation Transactions/Initial Portfolio 
 On May 12, 2021, shortly prior to our election to be regulated as a BDC and conversion to a Maryland corporation, and in order to avoid the blind pool-aspects typically associated with the launch of a new fund, we acquired from Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company MassMutual and C.M. Life Insurance Company CM Life ), a subsidiary of MassMutual, a select portfolio of senior secured private debt investments in, and funding obligations to, well-established middle-market businesses that operate across a wide range of industries (the Initial Portfolio ). 
 The investments in the Initial Portfolio were selected based upon our defined investment objective, amount and type of unfunded obligations associated with each investment and the investment requirements set forth under the 1940 Act or otherwise imposed by applicable laws, rules or regulations, including in accordance with our election to be treated as a RIC for tax purposes. 
 The aggregate purchase price for the Initial Portfolio was 602.4 million, which is equal to the sum of the fair values of each investment in the Initial Portfolio at the time of purchase of the Initial Portfolio, net of accrued fees associated with certain unfunded obligations in the Initial Portfolio. The investments in the Initial Portfolio were valued as of March 31, 2021 by an independent third-party valuation firm, provided that any investments in the Initial Portfolio acquired by MassMutual or CM Life after March 31, 2021 were initially valued at cost. In connection with the acquisition of the Initial Portfolio, Barings conducted certain valuation procedures to confirm whether there had been any material changes to the fair value of the investments and obligations in the Initial Portfolio from the previously determined fair value thereof and concluded that no purchase price adjustments were necessary given the absence of any such material changes. 
 We continue to invest in predominately senior secured private debt investments in well-established middle-market businesses that operate across a wide range of industries. Senior secured private debt investments are negotiated directly with the borrower, rather than marketed by a third party or bought and sold in the secondary market. We believe senior secured private debt investments may offer higher returns and certain more favorable protections than syndicated senior secured loans. Fees generated in connection with our debt investments are recognized over the life of the loan using the effective interest method or, in some cases, recognized as earned. Terms of our senior secured private debt investments are generally between five and seven years and bear interest between the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR (or the applicable currency rate for investments in foreign currencies) plus 475 basis points and SOFR plus 675 basis points per annum. To a lesser extent, we will invest opportunistically in assets such as, without limitation, equity, special situations, structured credit (e.g., private asset-backed securities), syndicated loan opportunities and/or mortgage securities. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average yield on the principal amount of our outstanding debt investments other than non-accrual debt investments was approximately 10.7 and 11.1 , respectively. The weighted average yield on the principal amount of all of our outstanding debt investments (including non-accrual debt investments) was approximately 10.5 and 11.0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Our Adviser, Barings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MassMutual, is a leading global asset management firm and is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act.

Barings GPFG manages private funds and separately managed accounts, along with multiple public vehicles. The Adviser has retained its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Baring International Investment Limited BIIL ), as a sub-adviser to manage European investments for us. BIIL is an investment adviser registered with the SEC in the U.S. and the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom with its principal office located in London, England. 
 Among other things, Barings (i) determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes therein and the manner of implementing such changes; (ii) identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments made by us; (iii) executes, closes, services and monitors the investments that we make; (iv) determines the securities and other assets that we will purchase, retain or sell; (v) performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and (vi) provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds. 
 Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, Barings (in its capacity as our administrator) performs (or oversees, or arranges for, the performance of) the administrative services necessary for our operation, including, but not limited to, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such office facilities and such other services as Barings, subject to review by the Board, will from time to time determine to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement. Barings also, on our behalf and subject to the Board s oversight, arranges for the services of, and oversees, custodians, depositories, transfer agents, dividend disbursing agents, other stockholder servicing agents, accountants, attorneys, underwriters, brokers and dealers, corporate fiduciaries, insurers, banks and such other persons in any such other capacity deemed to be necessary or desirable.

Also included in Barings GPFG are its Europe and Asia-Pacific Investment Committees and Private Finance Teams, which are responsible for our investment origination and portfolio monitoring activities for middle-market companies in Europe and Asia-Pacific geographies. In addition, Barings believes that it has best-in-class support personnel, including expertise in risk management, legal, accounting, tax, information technology and compliance, among others. We expect to benefit from the support provided by these personnel in our operations. 
 We have entered into an expense support agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with Barings, pursuant to which Barings may elect to pay certain of our expenses on our behalf Expense Payments ), including organization and offering expenses, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any of our interest expenses or any distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees. Any Expense Payment that Barings commits to pay must be paid by Barings to us in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than forty-five days after such commitment is made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from us to Barings or its affiliates. If Barings elects to pay certain of our expenses, Barings will be entitled to reimbursement of such expenses from us if Available Operating Funds (as defined in Note 2. Agreements and Related Party Transactions to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to our stockholders, subject to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement.

Portfolio Risk Monitoring 
 The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. As part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, rates each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk ratings may not be comparable to ones used by other companies. For additional information regarding the Adviser s portfolio management and investment monitoring, see Item 1. Business Portfolio Management and Investment Monitoring in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Our risk assessment is based on the following risk rating categories: 
 
 Risk Rating 1: In the opinion of the Adviser, the issuer is performing materially above expectations at the time of underwriting and the business trends and/or risk factors are favorable. 
 Risk Rating 2: In the opinion of the Adviser, the issuer is performing in a manner consistent with expectations at the time of underwriting and the current risk is believed to be similar to that at the time the asset was originated. 
 Risk Rating 3: In the opinion of the Adviser, the issuer is performing below expectations at the time of underwriting and the investment risk has increased since underwriting. 
 Risk Rating 4: In the opinion of the Adviser, the issuer is performing materially below expectations at the time of underwriting and the investment risk has increased materially since underwriting. Issuers with a risk rating of 4 are typically in violation of one or more debt covenants. 
 Risk Rating 5: In the opinion of the Adviser, the issuer is performing substantially below expectations at the time of underwriting and indicates the investment risk has increased substantially since underwriting. Loans with a risk rating of 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full or have a possibility to not be repaid in full, and the fair market value reflects the Adviser s current estimate of recoverable value. 
 
 The following table shows the classification of our investments by risk rating as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Investment risk ratings are accurate only as of those dates and may change due to subsequent developments to a portfolio company s business or financial condition, market conditions or developments, and other factors.

 Non-Accrual Assets 
 Generally, when interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. As of September 30, 2024, we had six portfolio companies with investments on non-accrual, the aggregate fair value of which was 22.2 million, which comprised 0.8 of the total fair value of our portfolio, and the aggregate cost of which was 42.3 million, which comprised 1.5 of the total cost of our portfolio.

 The change in total investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in the average size of our portfolio and increased dividends from portfolio companies and joint venture investments.

Interest and Other Financing Fees 
 Interest and other financing fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily attributable to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the SMBC Credit Facility, the July 2026 Notes, the May 2027 Notes (each as defined below under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources and our term debt securitization (including the 2023 Debt Securitization (as defined below under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources as initially completed in August 2023 and refinanced and upsized in the CLO Transaction (as defined below under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources in September 2024, and as amended, restated and modified from time to time, the BPCC Debt Securitization ). Interest and other financing fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were attributable to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the SMBC Credit Facility, the 2023 Debt Securitization, the July 2026 Notes, the May 2027 Notes and Secured Borrowings (as defined below under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources ). 
 The decrease in interest and other financing fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to decreased average borrowings under both the Revolving Credit Facility and the SMBC Credit Facility. Average borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the SMBC Credit Facility totaled 466.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 782.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The increase in interest and other financing fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to an increase in the weighted average interest rate on the interest rate swaps relating to the Series D and Series E Notes which, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 8.6 , as compared to 8.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Base Management Fee 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, we pay Barings a base management fee (the Base Management Fee ), quarterly in arrears on a calendar quarter basis. The Base Management Fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters prior to the quarter for which such fees are being calculated. The Base Management Fee for any partial quarter is appropriately pro-rated. See Note 2. Agreements and Related Party Transactions to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Advisory Agreement and the fee arrangement thereunder. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount of Base Management Fees incurred were approximately 5.0 million and 14.4 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the amount of base management fees incurred were approximately 4.3 million and 12.4 million, respectively. The increase in the Base Management Fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the corresponding 2023 periods is primarily related to the average value of gross assets increasing from 2,309.8 million as of the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters prior to September 30, 2023 to 2,651.8 million as of the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters prior to September 30, 2024. 
 Incentive Fee 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, we pay Barings an incentive fee. The incentive fee is determined and paid quarterly in arrears based on the amount by which (x) the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the then-current calendar quarter and the three preceding calendar quarters (the Trailing Twelve Months ), exceeds (y) the hurdle amount in respect of the Trailing Twelve Months. The incentive fee is subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap ), which during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was an amount equal to 0.50 of the average value of the our gross assets (excluding (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) net unsettled purchases and sales of investments) at the end of each quarter during the trailing twelve months and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the period. See Note 2. Agreements and Related Party Transactions to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the terms of the Advisory Agreement and the fee arrangements thereunder. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount of incentive fee incurred was approximately 3.4 million and 9.6 million, respectively, as compared to 2.9 million and 8.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the incentive fee for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, relates predominately to an increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income and to the value of the gross assets used in the Incentive Fee Cap calculation. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income was approximately 55.4 million and 153.8 million, respectively, as compared to approximately 38.1 million and 115.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average value of gross assets used in the Incentive Fee Cap calculation increased from 2,304.5 million as of September 30, 2023 to 2,683.3 million as of September 30, 2024.

We reimburse Barings for the costs and expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the Administration Agreement in an amount negotiated and mutually agreed to by us and Barings quarterly in arrears; provided that the agreed-upon quarterly expense amount will not exceed the amount of expenses that would otherwise be reimbursable by us under the Administration Agreement for the applicable quarterly period, and Barings will not be entitled to the recoupment of any amounts in excess of the agreed-upon quarterly expense amount. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount of administration expense incurred and invoiced by Barings for expenses was 0.4 million and 1.3 million, respectively.

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

As a result of stockholder approval, effective May 14, 2021, our applicable minimum asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act was decreased to 150 from 200 . Thus, we are permitted under the 1940 Act, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150 immediately after each such issuance. Our asset coverage ratio was 266.4 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Cash Flows 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a net increase in cash in the amount of 17.4 million. During that period, our operating activities used 280.9 million in cash, consisting primarily of purchases of portfolio investments of 861.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales or repayments of portfolio investments totaling 486.3 million. In addition, our financing activities provided net cash of 298.3 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 597.1 million and net proceeds from the refinancing of the BPCC Debt Securitization of 7.5 million, partially offset by net repayments of 128.5 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and SMBC Credit Facility, dividends paid in the amount of 133.6 million and 36.0 million in share repurchases.

Secured Borrowings 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no secured borrowings Secured Borrowings outstanding. On June 9, 2023, the remaining Secured Borrowings were repaid in full. Secured Borrowings were recorded as a result of certain securities that were sold and simultaneously repurchased at a premium, with amounts payable to the counterparty due on the repurchase settlement date, which was generally within 120 days of the trade date. 
 Discretionary Share Repurchase Program 
 We have commenced a discretionary share repurchase program in which we may, subject to market conditions and the discretion of the Board, offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of our shares of common stock outstanding as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time if in its reasonable judgment if it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Exchange Act Rule 13e-4 and the 1940 Act and subject to compliance with applicable covenants and restrictions under our financing arrangements. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be redeemed and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under our discretionary share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we expect to repurchase shares pursuant to quarterly tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter (the Valuation Date ). Stockholders who purchase shares of our common stock on or after March 1, 2024 should keep in mind that if they tender shares of our common stock in a tender offer with a Valuation Date that is within the 12-month period following the initial issue date of their tendered shares, we may repurchase such shares subject to an early repurchase deduction of 2 of the aggregate NAV of the shares repurchased (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining holders of our common stock. This Early Repurchase Deduction will also generally apply to minimum account repurchases. We may, from time to time, waive the Early Repurchase Deduction in the following circumstances, subject to certain conditions: repurchases resulting from death, qualifying disability or divorce; in the event that a stockholder s shares are repurchased because the stockholder has failed to maintain the 5,000 minimum account balance; or due to trade or operational error. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 696,636 and 2,402,488 shares, respectively, were accepted for repurchase for a total value of 14.5 million and 50.3 million, respectively. 
 Distributions to Stockholders 
 We intend to pay distributions to our stockholders of substantially all of our income, as determined by the Board in its discretion considering factors such as our earnings, cash flow, capital needs and general financial condition and the requirements of Maryland law. As a result, our distribution rates and payment frequency may vary from time to time . We generally intend to declare regular monthly dividends on a quarterly basis, although the frequency of such distributions may vary. 
 
 125 

We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan DRIP that provides for reinvestment of dividends on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, when we declare a cash dividend, stockholders who have not opted out of the DRIP will have their dividends automatically reinvested in shares of our common stock, rather than receiving cash dividends. 
 We have elected for federal income tax purposes to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code and intend to make the required distributions to our stockholders as specified therein. In order to qualify for and maintain our tax treatment as a RIC and to obtain RIC tax benefits, we must meet certain minimum distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. If such requirements are met, then we will generally be required to pay income taxes only on the portion of our taxable income and gains we do not distribute (actually or constructively). We monitor our distribution requirements with the goal of ensuring compliance with the Code. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any level of cash distributions and our ability to make distributions will be limited by the asset coverage requirement and related provisions under the 1940 Act and contained in any applicable indenture or financing arrangement and related supplements. In addition, in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs, we may declare a significant portion of our dividends in shares of our common stock instead of in cash. A stockholder generally would be subject to tax on 100 of the fair market value of the dividend on the date the dividend is received by the stockholder in the same manner as a cash dividend, even though a portion of the dividend was paid in shares of our common stock. 
 The minimum distribution requirements applicable to RICs require us to distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90 of our investment company taxable income ICTI ). Depending on the level of ICTI and net capital gain, if any, earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such excess. Any such carryover income must be distributed before the end of the next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such income. 
 ICTI generally differs from net investment income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses. We may be required to recognize ICTI in certain circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount OID (such as debt instruments issued with warrants), we must include in ICTI each year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in ICTI other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as (i) PIK interest income and (ii) interest income from investments that have been classified as non-accrual for financial reporting purposes. Interest income on non-accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes, but generally is recognized in ICTI. Because any OID or other amounts accrued will be included in our ICTI for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements, even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount. ICTI also excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized. 
 Recent Developments 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we made approximately 201.4 million of new commitments, of which 179.5 million closed and funded. The 179.5 million of investments consists of 168.1 million of first lien senior secured debt investments, 10.9 million of structured products and 0.5 million of equity investments . The weighted average yield of the debt investments was 9.7 . In addition, we funded 21.1 million of previously committed revolvers and delayed draw term loans . 
 On October 1, 2024, we sold 1,962,236.20 unregistered shares of our common stock (with the number of shares issued being determined on October 22, 2024), for aggregate consideration of approximately 40.8 million at a price per share of 20.78, determined in accordance with Section 23 of the 1940 Act. The sale of common stock was made pursuant to subscription agreements entered into by us and the participating investors in connection with the Private Offering pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D thereunder and/or Regulation S under the Securities Act. 
 On November 6, 2024, the Board declared regular monthly distributions for December 2024 through February 2025. The regular monthly cash distributions, each in the gross amount of 0.20 per share, are payable on December 27, 2024, January 27, 2025 and February 26, 2025, to stockholders of record on December 24, 2024, January 24, 2025 and February 24, 2025, respectively. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of our unaudited financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered by such financial statements. We have identified 
 
 126 

investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows. 
 Valuation of Investments 
 The Adviser conducts the valuation of our investments, upon which our NAV is primarily based, in accordance with its valuation policy, as well as established and documented processes and methodologies for determining the fair values of portfolio company investments on a recurring (at least quarterly) basis in accordance with the 1940 Act and FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC Topic 820 ). Our current valuation policy and processes were established by the Adviser and were approved by the Board. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio, valued at fair value in accordance with the Board-approved valuation policies, represented approximately 155 of our total net assets, as compared to approximately 188 of our total net assets as of December 31, 2023. 
 Under ASC Topic 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller at the measurement date. For our portfolio securities, fair value is generally the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security. The fair value measurement assumes that the sale occurs in the principal market for the security, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the security. If no market for the security exists or if we do not have access to the principal market, the security should be valued based on the sale occurring in a hypothetical market. 
 Under ASC Topic 820, there are three levels of valuation inputs, as follows: 
 Level 1 Inputs include quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2 Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
 Level 3 Inputs include inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 
 A financial instrument is categorized within the ASC Topic 820 valuation hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input to the valuation process that is significant to the fair value measurement. For example, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3). Therefore, unrealized appreciation and depreciation related to such investments categorized as Level 3 investments within the tables in the notes to our consolidated financial statements may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable inputs (Level 3). 
 Our investment portfolio includes certain debt and equity instruments of privately held companies for which quoted prices or other observable inputs falling within the categories of Level 1 and Level 2 are generally not available. In such cases, the Adviser determines the fair value of our investments in good faith primarily using Level 3 inputs. In certain cases, quoted prices or other observable inputs exist, and if so, the Adviser assesses the appropriateness of the use of these third-party quotes in determining fair value based on (i) its understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer and (ii) the depth and consistency of broker quotes and the correlation of changes in broker quotes with underlying performance of the portfolio company. 
 There is no single approach for determining fair value in good faith, as fair value depends upon the specific circumstances of each individual investment. The recorded fair values of our Level 3 investments may differ significantly from fair values that would have been used had an active market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned. 
 
 127 

Investment Valuation Process 
 The Board must determine fair value in good faith for any or all of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available. The Board has designated the Adviser as valuation designee to perform the fair value determinations relating to the value of these assets. Barings has established a pricing committee that is, subject to the oversight of the Board, responsible for the approval, implementation and oversight of the processes and methodologies that relate to the pricing and valuation of assets we hold. Barings uses independent third-party providers to price the portfolio, but in the event an acceptable price cannot be obtained from an approved external source, Barings will utilize alternative methods in accordance with internal pricing procedures established by Barings pricing committee. 
 At least annually, Barings conducts reviews of the primary pricing vendors to validate that the inputs used in the vendors pricing process are deemed to be market observable. While Barings is not provided access to proprietary models of the vendors, the reviews have included on-site walkthroughs of the pricing process, methodologies and control procedures for each asset class and level for which prices are provided. The review also includes an examination of the underlying inputs and assumptions for a sample of individual securities across asset classes, credit rating levels and various durations, a process Barings continues to perform annually. In addition, the pricing vendors have an established challenge process in place for all security valuations, which facilitates identification and resolution of prices that fall outside expected ranges. Barings believes that the prices received from the pricing vendors are representative of prices that would be received to sell the assets at the measurement date (i.e., exit prices). 
 Our money market fund investments are generally valued using Level 1 inputs and our equity investments listed on an exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market System are valued using Level 1 inputs, using the last quoted sale price of that day. Our syndicated senior secured loans and structured product investments are generally valued using Level 2 inputs, which are generally valued at the bid quotation obtained from dealers in loans by an independent pricing service. Our middle-market, private debt and equity investments are generally valued using Level 3 inputs. 
 Independent Valuation 
 The fair value of loans and equity investments that are not syndicated or for which market quotations are not readily available, including middle-market loans, are generally submitted to independent providers to perform an independent valuation on those loans and equity investments as of the end of each quarter. Such loans and equity investments are initially held at cost, as that is a reasonable approximation of fair value on the acquisition date, and monitored for material changes that could affect the valuation (for example, changes in interest rates or the credit quality of the borrower). At the quarter end following that of the initial acquisition, such loans and equity investments are generally sent to a valuation provider which will determine the fair value of each investment. The independent valuation providers apply various methods (synthetic rating analysis, discounting cash flows, and re-underwriting analysis) to establish the rate of return a market participant would require (the discount rate as of the valuation date, given market conditions, prevailing lending standards and the perceived credit quality of the issuer. Future expected cash flows for each investment are discounted back to present value using these discount rates in the discounted cash flow analysis. A range of values will be provided by the valuation provider and Barings will determine the point within that range that it will use. If the Barings pricing committee disagrees with the price range provided, it may make a fair value recommendation to Barings that is outside of the range provided by the independent valuation provider and the reasons therefore. In certain instances, we may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in the stockholders best interests, to request an independent valuation firm to perform an independent valuation on certain investments. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where the fair value of the investment in the portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to the total investment portfolio. 
 Valuation Inputs 
 The Adviser s valuation techniques are based upon both observable and unobservable pricing inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Adviser s market assumptions. The Adviser s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. An independent pricing service provider is the preferred source of pricing a loan, however, to the extent the independent pricing service provider price is unavailable or not relevant and reliable, the Adviser will utilize alternative approaches such as broker quotes or manual prices. The Adviser attempts to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The availability of observable inputs can vary from investment to investment and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of security, whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the security.

Valuation of Investments in CPCF BPCC LLC, Thompson Rivers LLC and Waccamaw River LLC 
 As CPCF BPCC LLC, Thompson Rivers LLC and Waccamaw River LLC (each as defined in Note 3. Investments in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements) are investment companies with no readily determinable fair values, the Adviser estimates the fair value of our investments in these entities using the NAV of each company and our ownership percentage as a practical expedient. The NAV is determined in accordance with the specialized accounting guidance for investment companies. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Interest and Dividend Income 
 Interest income, including amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Generally, when interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. The cessation of recognition of such interest will negatively impact the reported fair value of the investment. We write off any previously accrued and uncollected interest when it is determined that interest is no longer considered collectible. Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity is recorded on the ex-dividend date. 
 We may have to include interest income in our ICTI, including OID income, from investments that have been classified as non-accrual for financial reporting purposes. Interest income on non-accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes, but generally is recognized in ICTI. As a result, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements to maintain our RIC tax treatment, even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount. Additionally, any loss recognized by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes on previously accrued interest income will be treated as a capital loss. 
 Fee and Other Income 
 Origination, facility, commitment, consent and other advance fees received in connection with the origination of a loan, or Loan Origination Fees, are recorded as deferred income and recognized as investment income over the term of the loan. Upon prepayment of a loan, any unamortized Loan Origination Fees are recorded as investment income. In the general course of our business, we receive certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees, covenant waiver fees and loan amendment fees, and are recorded as investment income when earned. Other income includes royalty income received in connection to revenue participation rights which is recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with revenue participation right agreements and recognized as investment income over the term of the rights. 
 Fee and other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

 129 

Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Interest Income 
 We currently hold, and expect to hold in the future, some loans in our portfolio that contain PIK interest provisions. PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the loan, rather than being paid to us in cash, and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of PIK interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. 
 PIK interest, which is a non-cash source of income at the time of recognition, is included in our taxable income and therefore affects the amount we are required to distribute to our stockholders to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even though we have not yet collected the cash. Generally, when current cash interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing PIK interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. We write off any previously accrued and uncollected PIK interest when it is determined that the PIK interest is no longer collectible. 
 We may have to include in our ICTI, PIK interest income from investments that have been classified as non-accrual for financial reporting purposes. Interest income on non-accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes, but generally is recognized in ICTI. As a result, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements, even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount. 
 Unused Commitments 
 In the normal course of business, we are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, consisting primarily of unused commitments to extend financing to our portfolio companies. Since commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to market risk. Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The fair value of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the companies we invest in; conditions affecting the general economy; overall market changes; global pandemics; legislative reform; local, regional, national or global political, social or economic instability; and interest rate fluctuations. 
 In addition, we are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our 
 
 135 

interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing debt and liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio. Our net investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates, including EURIBOR, BBSY, STIBOR, CORRA, SOFR, SONIA, SARON, NIBOR and BKBM. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks. We regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk and determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. We currently, and may in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, no settings of the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR continue to be published. On March 15, 2022, the U.S. enacted federal legislation that is intended to minimize legal and economic uncertainty following U.S. dollar LIBOR s cessation by replacing LIBOR references in certain U.S. law-governed contracts under certain circumstances with a SOFR-based rate identified in a Federal Reserve rule plus a statutory spread adjustment. 
 Our loan agreements with our portfolio companies that referenced LIBOR included fallback language in the event that LIBOR was discontinued, became unrepresentative or in the event that the method for determining LIBOR has changed. As a result of this language or through other bi-lateral amendments, all of these loan agreements have transitioned to an alternative reference rate. 
 The transition away from LIBOR and reform, modification, or adjustments of other reference rate benchmarks to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of any changes in the pricing of our investments, changes to the documentation for certain of our investments and the pace of such changes, disputes and other actions regarding the interpretation of current and prospective loan documentation or modifications to processes and systems. 
 Following a campaign by the U.S. Federal Reserve of raising interest rates to address significant and persistent inflation in order to slow economic growth and reduce price pressure, in September 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a benchmark rate cut and has announced that it may cut benchmark rates further in the next year, depending on inflation reports and other metrics. A prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in SOFR are not offset by a corresponding increase in the spread over SOFR that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in in our operating expenses, including with respect to our income incentive fee, or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities tied to SOFR. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 2,457.8 million (principal amount) of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at variable rates, which generally are SOFR-based (or based on an equivalent applicable currency rate), and many of which are subject to certain floors. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 974.4 million (principal amount) of our borrowings bore interest at variable rates (approximately 86.7 of our total borrowings as of September 30, 2024) under the Revolving Credit Facility, the SMBC Credit Facility, the BPCC Debt Securitization and the May 2027 Notes. See Note 5. Borrowings to our Unconsolidated Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the variable interest rates and spreads applicable to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the SMBC Credit Facility, the BPCC Debt Securitization and the May 2027 Notes. 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet, the following table shows the annual impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates on our debt investments and borrowings (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

 (2) Excludes the impact of income based fees. See Note 2. Agreements and Related Party Transactions to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the income based fees.

We may also have exposure to foreign currencies related to certain investments. Such investments are translated into U.S. dollars based on the spot rate at the relevant balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in the exchange rate. In order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates, we generally borrow in local foreign currencies under the Revolving Credit Facility to finance such investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had U.S. dollar borrowings of 190.4 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility with a weighted average interest rate of 7.645 (three month SOFR of 4.995 ), borrowings denominated in British pounds sterling of 17.2 million 23.1 million U.S. dollars) with a weighted average interest rate of 7.819 (weighted average three month adjusted cumulative compounded SONIA of 5.200 ), borrowings denominated in Australian dollars of A 2.8 million 1.9 million U.S. dollars) with an interest rate of 6.992 (three month BBSW of 4.492 ), borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars of C 5.4 million 4.0 million U.S. dollars) with an interest rate of 7.280 (three month CDOR of 4.780 ), borrowings denominated in New Zealand dollars of NZ 5.1 million 3.2 million U.S. dollars) with an interest rate of 7.955 (three month NZBB of 5.455 and borrowings denominated in Euros of 88.6 million 98.9 million U.S. dollars) with an interest rate of 6.136 (three month EURIBOR of 3.636 ). 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Neither we, the Adviser, nor our subsidiaries are currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our respective businesses. We, the Adviser, and our subsidiaries may from time to time, however, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, including in connection with strategic transactions. Furthermore, third parties may seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, we do not expect any current matters will materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 You should carefully consider the risks referenced below and all other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our interim financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to transact in our securities. The risks and uncertainties referenced herein are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results, as well as the value of our securities. 
 There have been no material changes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which you should carefully consider before transacting in our securities. If any of such risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the value of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

 References to (i) the redemption of Secured Debt shall be understood to refer, in the case of the Class A-1 Loans, to the repayment or prepayment, as applicable, of the Class A-1 Loans, by the Issuers and (ii) the issuance of Secured Debt or to the execution, authentication and or delivery of Secured Debt shall be understood to refer, in the case of the Class A-1 Loans, to the incurrence of the Class A-1 Loans, by the Issuers, pursuant to the Class A-1 Credit Agreements. 
 Section 1.3 Assumptions as to Assets . In connection with all calculations required to be made pursuant to this Indenture with respect to Scheduled Distributions on any Asset, or any payments on any other assets included in the Assets, with respect to the sale of and reinvestment in Collateral Obligations, and with respect to the income that can be earned on Scheduled Distributions on such Assets and on any other amounts that may be received for deposit in the Collection Account, the provisions set forth in this Section 1.3 (Assumptions as to Assets) shall be applied. The provisions of this Section 1.3 (Assumptions as to Assets) shall be applicable to any determination or calculation that is covered by this Section 1.3 (Assumptions as to Assets) , whether or not reference is specifically made to this Section 1.3 (Assumptions as to Assets) , unless some other method of calculation or determination is expressly specified in the particular provision. 
 (a) All calculations with respect to Scheduled Distributions on the Assets shall be made on the basis of information as to the terms of each such Asset and upon reports of payments, if any, received on such Asset that are furnished by or on behalf of the issuer of such Asset and, to the extent they are not manifestly in error, such information or reports may be conclusively relied upon in making such calculations. 
 (b) For purposes of calculating the Coverage Tests, except as otherwise specified in the Coverage Tests, such calculations will not include scheduled interest and principal payments on Defaulted Obligations unless or until such payments are actually made. 
 (c) For each Collection Period and as of any date of determination, the Scheduled Distribution on any Asset (including DIP Collateral Obligations but excluding Defaulted Obligations, which, except as otherwise provided herein, shall be assumed to have Scheduled Distributions of zero, except to the extent any payments have actually been received) shall be the sum of (i) the total amount of payments and collections to be received during such Collection Period in respect of such Asset (including the proceeds of the sale of such Asset 
 86 

received and, in the case of sales which have not yet settled, anticipated to be received during the Collection Period and not reinvested in additional Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments or retained in the Collection Account for subsequent reinvestment pursuant to Section 12.2 (Purchase of Additional Collateral Obligations) that, if paid as scheduled, will be available in the Collection Account at the end of the Collection Period and (ii) any such amounts received by the Issuer in prior Collection Periods that were not disbursed on a previous Payment Date. 
 (d) Each Scheduled Distribution receivable with respect to a Collateral Obligation shall be assumed to be received on the applicable Due Date, and each such Scheduled Distribution shall be assumed to be immediately deposited in the Collection Account to earn interest at the Assumed Reinvestment Rate. All such funds shall be assumed to continue to earn interest until the date on which they are required to be available in the Collection Account for application, in accordance with the terms hereof, to payments of principal of or interest on the Secured Debt or other amounts payable pursuant to this Indenture or the Class A-1 Credit Agreements. For purposes of the applicable determinations required by Section 10.7(b)(iii) (Accountings) , Article XII and the definition of Interest Coverage Ratio , the expected interest on the Secured Debt and Floating Rate Obligations will be calculated using the then current interest rates applicable thereto. 
 (e) References in Section 11.1(a) (Disbursements of Monies from Payment Account) to calculations made on a pro forma basis shall mean such calculations after giving effect to all payments, in accordance with the Priority of Payments described herein, that precede (in priority of payment) or include the clause in which such calculation is made. 
 (f) Except where expressly referenced herein for inclusion in such calculations, Defaulted Obligations will not be included in the calculation of the Collateral Quality Test or the S&P Equivalent Weighted Average Rating Factor. For purposes of calculating all Concentration Limitations, in both the numerator and the denominator of any component of the Concentration Limitations, Defaulted Obligations will be treated as having a Principal Balance of zero. 
 (g) For purposes of calculating compliance with the Investment Criteria, upon the direction of the Collateral Manager by notice to the Collateral Trustee and the Collateral Administrator, any Eligible Investment representing Principal Proceeds received upon the sale or other disposition of a Collateral Obligation shall be deemed to have the characteristics of such Collateral Obligation until reinvested in an additional Collateral Obligation. Such calculations shall be based upon the principal amount of such Collateral Obligation, except in the case of Defaulted Obligations and Credit Risk Obligations, in which case the calculations will be based upon the Principal Proceeds received on the disposition or sale of such Defaulted Obligation or Credit Risk Obligation. 
 (h) For the purposes of calculating compliance with each of the Concentration Limitations all calculations will be rounded to the nearest 0.1 . All other calculations, unless otherwise set forth herein or the context otherwise requires, shall be rounded to the nearest ten thousandth if expressed as a percentage, and to the nearest one hundredth if expressed otherwise. 
 87 

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture to the contrary, all monetary calculations under this Indenture shall be in Dollars. 
 (j) Any reference in this Indenture to an amount of the Collateral Trustee's or the Collateral Administrator's fees calculated with respect to a period at a per annum rate shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed for the related Interest Accrual Period and shall be based on the Fee Basis Amount at the beginning of each Interest Accrual Period. 
 (k) To the extent of any ambiguity in the interpretation of any definition or term contained in this Indenture or to the extent more than one methodology can be used to make any of the determinations or calculations set forth herein, the Collateral Administrator shall request direction from the Collateral Manager as to the interpretation and or methodology to be used, and the Collateral Administrator shall follow such direction, and together with the Collateral Trustee, shall be entitled to conclusively rely thereon without any responsibility or liability therefor. 
 (l) For purposes of calculating compliance with any tests under this Indenture, the trade date (and not the settlement date) with respect to any acquisition or disposition of a Collateral Obligation or an Eligible Investment shall be used to determine whether and when such acquisition or disposition has occurred. 
 (m) If the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) is notified by the administrative agent or other withholding agent or otherwise for the syndicate of lenders in respect of (x) any amendment, waiver, consent or extension fees or (y) commitment fees or other similar fees in respect of Revolving Collateral Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation that any amounts associated therewith are subject to withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction, the applicable Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests shall be calculated thereafter net of the full amount of such withholding tax unless the related Obligor is required to make gross-up payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of any such withholding tax on an after-tax basis pursuant to the Underlying Instruments with respect thereto. 
 (n) For all purposes (including calculation of the Coverage Tests but excluding the calculation of the Aggregate Funded Spread), the Principal Balance of a Revolving Collateral Obligation or a Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation will include all unfunded commitments that have not been irrevocably reduced, withdrawn or expired. 
 (o) For purposes of calculating the sale proceeds of a Collateral Obligation in sale transactions, sale proceeds will include any Principal Financed Accrued Interest received in respect of such sale.

 88 

proposed to be entered into within the 10 days following the date of determination of such compliance (such period, the Trading Plan Period provided that (1) with respect to Discount Obligations, no such calculation or evaluation may be made using the weighted average price of any Collateral Obligation or any group of Collateral Obligations, (2) no day during any Trading Plan Period relating to a Trading Plan may be a Determination Date, (3) no Trading Plan may result in the purchase of Collateral Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance that exceeds 7.5 of the Collateral Principal Amount as of the first day of the Trading Plan Period, (4) no more than one Trading Plan may be in effect at any time during a Trading Plan Period, (5) no Trading Plan may result in the purchase of Collateral Obligations with an Average Life of less than six months, (6) no Trading Plan may result in the purchase of a group of Collateral Obligations if the difference between the shortest Average Life of any Collateral Obligation in such group and the longest Average Life of any Collateral Obligation in such group is greater than three years and (7) if the Investment Criteria are satisfied prospectively after giving effect to a Trading Plan but are not satisfied upon the expiry of the related Trading Plan Period, the Investment Criteria shall not at any time thereafter be evaluated by giving effect to a Trading Plan, unless the S&P Rating Condition is satisfied with respect to a subsequent Trading Plan provided that this clause (7) shall be disregarded if the Collateral Manager obtains the consent of the Controlling Class. The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer's behalf) will provide notice to S&P of any failed Trading Plan. The Collateral Manager will provide notice to the Collateral Trustee as soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of a Trading Plan and the Collateral Trustee will post such notice on its website. 
 (q) If a Collateral Obligation included in the Assets would be deemed a Current Pay Obligation but for the applicable percentage limitation in the proviso to the definition of Defaulted Obligation , then the Current Pay Obligations with the lowest Market Value (expressed as a percentage of the Principal Balance of such Current Pay Obligations as of the date of determination) shall be deemed Defaulted Obligations. Each such Defaulted Obligation will be treated as a Defaulted Obligation for all purposes until such time as the Aggregate Principal Balance of Current Pay Obligations would not exceed, on a pro forma basis including such Defaulted Obligation, the applicable percentage of the Collateral Principal Amount. 
 (r) No Restructured Loan shall be included in the calculation of any Coverage Test, the Concentration Limitations or any Collateral Quality Test. 
 (s) For purposes of determining the total potential indebtedness of any Obligor of a Drop Down Asset, such total potential indebtedness of the Obligor thereof shall be deemed to include the total potential indebtedness of the Obligor of the related Subject Asset. 
 (t) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the standard of care under the Collateral Management Agreement and the legal, contractual and fiduciary duties owed by the Collateral Manager, including the duty to act in the best interest of the Issuers, whenever in the Indenture or any other Transaction Document the Collateral Manager is permitted or required to make a decision in its sole discretion, reasonable discretion or discretion or under a grant of similar authority or latitude, the Collateral 
 89

Regardless of whether any Priority Class is Outstanding with respect a Deferrable Class, to the extent that funds are not available on any Payment Date (other than the Redemption Date with respect to, or Stated Maturity of, such Class of Debt) to pay previously accrued Deferred Interest, such previously accrued Deferred Interest will not be due and payable on such Payment Date, but will be deferred and added to the principal balance of such Class for all purposes (including, for purposes of the Overcollateralization Ratio Tests) and, thereafter, such Deferred Interest shall accrue interest at the Interest Rate for such Class until paid as provided herein, and any failure to pay such previously accrued Deferred Interest on such Payment Date will not be an Event of Default. Interest will cease to accrue on the Secured Debt, or in the case of a partial repayment, on such repaid part, from the date of repayment. To the extent lawful and enforceable, interest on any interest that is not paid when due on any Class A-1A Notes, Class A-1 Loans, Class A-1AL Notes, Class A-1B Notes or Class A-2 Notes or, if there are no Class A-1A Notes, Class A-1 Loans, Class A-1AL Notes, Class A-1B Notes or Class A-2 Notes Outstanding, any Class B Notes, or if no Class B Notes are Outstanding, any Class C Notes shall accrue at the Interest Rate for such Class until paid as provided herein. 
 (b) The principal of the Secured Debt of each Class matures at par and is due and payable on the date of the applicable Stated Maturity for such Class, unless such principal has been previously repaid or unless the unpaid principal of such Secured Debt becomes due and payable at an earlier date by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the payment of principal of each Class of Secured Debt (and payments of Principal Proceeds to the Holders of the Subordinated Notes) may only occur in accordance with the Priority of Payments. Payments of principal on any Class of Secured Debt, and distributions of Principal Proceeds to Holders of Subordinated Notes, which are not paid, in accordance with the Priority of Payments, on any Payment Date (other than the Payment Date which is the Stated Maturity of such Class of Debt or any Redemption Date), because of insufficient funds therefor shall not be considered due and payable for purposes of Section 5.1(a) (Events of Default) until the Payment Date on which such principal may be paid in accordance with the Priority of Payments or all Priority Classes with respect to such Class have been paid in full. 
 108 

(c) Principal payments on the Debt will be made in accordance with the Priority of Payments and Article IX . 
 (d) The Paying Agent shall require the previous delivery of properly completed and signed applicable tax certifications (generally, in the case of U.S. federal income tax, an IRS Form W-9 (or applicable successor form) in the case of a United States person (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) or the applicable IRS Form W-8 (or applicable successor form) in the case of a Person that is not a United States person (for U.S. federal income tax purposes)) or other certification acceptable to it to enable the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Collateral Trustee and any Paying Agent to determine their duties and liabilities with respect to any taxes or other charges that they may be required to pay, deduct or withhold from payments in respect of such Debt or the Holder or beneficial owner of such Debt under any present or future law or regulation of Bermuda, the United States, any other jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority therein or to comply with any reporting or other requirements under any such law or regulation and the delivery of any information requested by the Issuer in order for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and or the Bermuda FATCA Legislation. The Issuers shall not be obligated to pay any additional amounts to the Holders or beneficial owners of the Debt as a result of deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges with respect to the Debt. Nothing herein shall be construed to obligate the Paying Agent to determine the duties or liabilities of the Issuer or any other paying agent with respect to any tax certification or withholding requirements, or any tax certification or withholding requirements of any jurisdiction, political subdivision or taxing authority outside the United States. 
 (e) Payments in respect of interest on and principal of any Secured Debt and any payment with respect to any Subordinated Note shall be made by the Collateral Trustee in Dollars to DTC or its designee with respect to a Global Note and to the Holder or its nominee with respect to a Certificated Note, by wire transfer, as directed by the Holder, in immediately available funds to a Dollar account maintained by DTC or its nominee with respect to a Global Note, and to the Holder or its nominee with respect to a Certificated Note provided that (1) in the case of a Certificated Note, the Holder thereof shall have provided written wiring instructions to the Collateral Trustee on or before the related Record Date and (2) if appropriate instructions for any such wire transfer are not received by the related Record Date, then such payment shall be made by check drawn on a U.S. bank mailed to the address of the Holder specified in the Register. Upon final payment due on the Maturity of a Note, the Holder thereof shall present and surrender such Note at the Corporate Trust Office of the Collateral Trustee or at the office of any Paying Agent on or prior to such Maturity provided that if the Collateral Trustee and the Applicable Issuers shall have been furnished such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless and an undertaking thereafter to surrender such certificate, then, in the absence of notice to the Applicable Issuers or the Collateral Trustee that the applicable Note has been acquired by a protected purchaser, such final payment shall be made without presentation or surrender. Neither the Issuers, the Collateral Trustee, the Collateral Manager, nor any Paying Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspects of the records maintained by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any of the Agent Members relating to or for payments made thereby on account of beneficial interests in a Global Note. In the case where 
 109

All payments on the Class A-1 Loans shall be made by the Collateral Trustee or the applicable Paying Agent to the Loan Agent for disbursement in accordance with the Class A-1 Credit Agreements. 
 (f) Payments of principal to Holders of the Secured Debt of each Class shall be made in the proportion that the Aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Secured Debt of such Class registered in the name of each such Holder on the applicable Record Date bears to the Aggregate Outstanding Amount of all Secured Debt of such Class on such Record Date. Payments to the Holders of the Subordinated Notes from Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds shall be made in the proportion that the Aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Subordinated Notes registered in the name of each such Holder on the applicable Record Date bears to the Aggregate Outstanding Amount of all Subordinated Notes on such Record Date. All payments on the Class A-1 Loans will be made by the Collateral Trustee to the Loan Agent and the Loan Agent will disburse such payments to the Class A-1 Lenders in accordance with the Class A-1 Credit Agreements. 
 (g) Interest accrued with respect to any Floating Rate Debt shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the applicable Interest Accrual Period divided by 360. Interest on the Fixed Rate Debt will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. 
 (h) All reductions in the principal amount of Debt (or one or more predecessor Debt effected by payments of installments of principal made on any Payment Date or Redemption Date shall be binding upon all future Holders of such Debt and of any Debt issued or incurred, as applicable, upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, whether or not such payment is noted on such Debt. 
 (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the obligations of the Issuer under the Debt, this Indenture and the Class A-1 Credit Agreements are from time to time and at any time limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and the Co-Issued Debt are non-recourse obligations of the Co-Issuer payable solely from the Assets available at such time and following realization of the Assets, and application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with this Indenture, all obligations of and any remaining claims against the Issuers hereunder or in connection herewith after such realization shall be extinguished and shall not thereafter revive. No recourse shall be had against any Officer, director, employee, shareholder, authorized person or incorporator of the Issuers, the Collateral Manager or any Affiliates of the foregoing Person, successors or assigns for any amounts payable under the Debt or this Indenture or the Class A-1 
 110

It is further understood that the foregoing provisions of this clause (i) shall not limit the right of any Person to name the Issuer or the Co-Issuer as a party defendant in any Proceeding or in the exercise of any other remedy under the Debt, this Indenture or the Class A-1 Credit Agreements, so long as no judgment in the nature of a deficiency judgment or seeking personal liability shall be asked for or (if obtained) enforced against any such Person or entity.

Such Holder acknowledges that, in the event such Holder fails to provide such information or documentation for the purposes of FATCA, or to the extent that its ownership of Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to any tax under FATCA, (A) the Issuer (and any agent acting on its behalf) is authorized to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the investor as compensation for any amounts withheld from payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer as a result of such failure or such ownership, and (B) to the extent necessary to avoid an adverse effect on the Issuer as a result of such failure or such ownership, the Issuer will have the right to compel the investor to sell its Notes and, if such person does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer or its agents, the Issuer will have the right to sell such Notes at a public or private sale called and conducted in any manner permitted by law, and to remit the net proceeds of such sale (taking into account, in addition to other related costs and charges, any taxes incurred by the Issuer in connection with such sale) to such person as payment in full for such Notes. The Issuer may also assign each such Note a separate securities identifier in the Issuer's sole discretion. Each Holder agrees that the Issuer, the Collateral Trustee and or their agents or representatives may (1) provide any information and documentation concerning its investment in its Notes to the Bermuda Monetary Authority in Bermuda, the IRS and any other relevant governmental, tax or regulatory authority and (2) take such other steps as they deem necessary or helpful to ensure that the Issuer complies with FATCA and the Bermuda FATCA Legislation.

 135 

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3 (Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Collateral Trustee) to the contrary, the Collateral Trustee may not sell or liquidate the Assets or institute Proceedings in furtherance thereof pursuant to this Section 5.3 (Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Collateral Trustee) except according to the provisions specified in Section 5.5(a) (Optional Preservation of Assets) .

 137 

Issuer or the Co-Issuer, as the case may be, adjudicated as bankrupt or insolvent or (ii) the filing of any petition seeking relief, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition or in respect of the Issuer or the Co-Issuer, as the case may be, under applicable Bankruptcy Law or any other applicable law).

The terms described in the immediately preceding sentence are referred to herein as the Bankruptcy Subordination Agreement . The Bankruptcy Subordination Agreement will constitute a subordination agreement within the meaning of Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Collateral Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon an Issuer Order with respect to the payment of any amounts payable to Holders, which amounts are subordinated pursuant to this Section 5.4(d)(ii) (Remedies) . 
 (iii) Nothing in this Section 5.4 (Remedies) shall preclude, or be deemed to stop, the Collateral Trustee (i) from taking any action prior to the expiration of the aforementioned period in (A) any case or Proceeding voluntarily filed or commenced by the Issuer or the Co-Issuer or (B) any involuntary insolvency Proceeding filed or commenced by a Person other than the Collateral Trustee, or (ii) from commencing against the Issuer or the Co-Issuer or any of their respective properties any legal action which is not a bankruptcy, winding-up, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, moratorium or liquidation Proceeding. 
 (iv) The parties hereto agree that the restrictions and the Bankruptcy Subordination Agreement provisions described in clause (ii) of this Section 5.4(d) (Remedies) are a material inducement for each Holder and beneficial owner of the Debt to acquire or make such Debt, and for the Issuer, the Co-Issuer and the Collateral Manager to enter into this Indenture (in the case of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer) and the other applicable Transaction Documents and are an essential term of this Indenture.

 Section 5.5 Optional Preservation of Assets . (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Trustee shall retain the Assets intact (except that, until a direction to commence a liquidation of the Assets following an Enforcement Event is delivered in accordance with this Indenture, Unsalable Assets and certain other types of Collateral Obligations may continue to be sold by the Issuer in accordance with Article XII while an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), collect and cause the collection of the proceeds thereof and make and apply all payments and deposits and maintain all accounts in respect of the Assets and the Debt in accordance with the Priority of Payments and the provisions of Article X , Article XII and Article XIII unless 
 (i) the Collateral Trustee, pursuant to Section 5.5(c) (Optional Preservation of Assets) , determines that the anticipated proceeds of a sale or liquidation of the Assets (after deducting the reasonable expenses of such sale or liquidation) would be sufficient to discharge in full the amounts then due (or, in the case of interest, accrued) and unpaid on the Secured Debt for principal and interest (including accrued and unpaid Deferred Interest), and all other amounts that, pursuant to the Priority of Payments, are required to be paid prior to such payments on such Secured Debt (including any amounts due and owing as Administrative Expenses (without regard to the Administrative Expense Cap), any amounts payable to any Hedge Counterparty pursuant to an early termination (or partial early termination) of the related Hedge Agreement as a result of a Priority Termination Event and any due and unpaid Collateral Management Fees) and a Majority of the Class A-1 Debt or, if there are no Class A-1 Debt Outstanding, a Supermajority of the Controlling Class agrees with such determination 
 (ii) if the Class A-1A Notes are Outstanding and an Event of Default specified in clauses (a), (e), (f) or (g) of Section 5.1 (Events of Default) has occurred and is continuing (without regard to whether another Event of Default has occurred prior, contemporaneously or subsequent to such Event of Default), a Majority of the Class A-1 Debt or, if there are no Class A-1 Debt Outstanding, a Supermajority of the Controlling Class directs the sale and liquidation of the Assets provided that this clause (ii) shall not apply in the case of an Event of Default pursuant to clause (a)(i) of the definition of Event of Default relating to the failure to pay interest on any Secured Debt (other than the Class A-1 Debt) while the Class A-1 Debt is the Controlling Class that arises solely from the application of monies in accordance with the order of priorities set forth in Section 11.1(a)(iv) (Disbursements of Monies from Payment Account) due to the acceleration of the Secured Debt resulting from an Event of Default arising pursuant to clauses (b), (c) or (d) of the definition of Event of Default or 
 (iii) in the case of an Event of Default other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.5(a)(ii) (Optional Preservation of Assets) , a Supermajority of each Class of Secured Debt (each voting separately by Class) directs the sale and liquidation of the Assets. 
 139 

So long as such Event of Default is continuing, any such retention pursuant to this Section 5.5(a) (Optional Preservation of Assets) may be rescinded at any time when the conditions specified in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) exist. 
 (b) Nothing contained in Section 5.5(a) (Optional Preservation of Assets) shall be construed to require the Collateral Trustee to sell the Assets securing the Secured Debt if the conditions set forth in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 5.5(a) (Optional Preservation of Assets) are not satisfied. Nothing contained in Section 5.5(a) (Optional Preservation of Assets) shall be construed to require the Collateral Trustee to preserve the Assets securing the Debt if prohibited by applicable law. 
 (c) In determining whether the condition specified in Section 5.5(a)(i) (Optional Preservation of Assets) exists, the Collateral Trustee shall use reasonable efforts to obtain, with the cooperation of the Collateral Manager, bid prices with respect to each Collateral Obligation and Equity Security contained in the Assets from two nationally recognized dealers (as specified by the Collateral Manager in writing) at the time making a market in such securities and shall compute the anticipated proceeds of sale or liquidation on the basis of the lower of such bid prices for each such security. In the event that the Collateral Trustee, with the cooperation of the Collateral Manager, is only able to obtain bid prices with respect to a Collateral Obligation or Equity Security contained in the Assets from one nationally recognized dealer at the time making a market in such securities, the Collateral Trustee shall compute the anticipated proceeds of sale or liquidation on the basis of such one bid price for such security. In addition, for the purposes of determining issues relating to the execution of a sale or liquidation of the Assets and the execution of a sale or other liquidation thereof in connection with a determination whether the condition specified in Section 5.5(a)(i) (Optional Preservation of Assets) exists, the Collateral Trustee may retain and rely on an opinion of an Independent investment banking firm of national reputation (the cost of which shall be payable as an Administrative Expense).

The Calculation Agent shall, in respect of the calculations it is required to make on any Interest Determination Date, have no liability for the use of Term SOFR as determined on the previous Interest Determination Date if so required under the definition of Term SOFR.

 (l) After giving effect to Section 7.17(m) and Section 7.17(n) , all Issuer items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the Holders of Subordinated Notes in a manner such that, after the allocation, each such Holder's capital account is equal (as nearly as possible) to the amount that such Holder would receive from the Issuer if the Issuer (i) sold all of its assets for their Book Values (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)), (ii) applied the proceeds to discharge Issuer liabilities at face amount (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the Book Values of the assets securing such liability), and (iii) distributed the remaining proceeds in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture (other than this Section 7.17 ), minus the sum of such Holder's share of partnership minimum gain (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(b)(2)) and partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(3)).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an allocation pursuant to this Section 7.17(m)(ii) will be made only if and to the extent that such Holder would have a deficit capital account in excess of such amount after all other allocations provided for in this Section 7.17 have been tentatively made as if this Section 7.17 did not include this Section 7.17(m)(ii) or the qualified income offset requirement of Section 7.17(m)(i) . 
 (iii) Nonrecourse deductions (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(b)(1)) will be specially allocated to the Holders of Subordinated Notes in the same manner as if they were not nonrecourse deductions. 
 (iv) No Holder of Subordinated Notes will be allocated items of loss or deduction under Section 7.17(l) or Section 7.17(n) if such allocation would cause or increase a deficit balance in such Holder's capital account as of the end of the Issuer taxable year to which such allocation relates, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). 
 (n) It is the intent of the Issuer that, to the extent possible, all special allocations made pursuant to Section 7.17(m) be offset either with other special allocations made pursuant to Section 7.17(m) or with special allocations made pursuant to this Section 7.17(n) . Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 7.17 (other than Section 7.17(m) ), offsetting special allocations of Issuer items of income, gain, loss and deduction will be made so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, the capital account balance of each Holder is, to the extent possible, equal to the capital account balance such Holder would have had if the special allocations made pursuant to Section 7.17(l) were not part of this Section 7.17 and all Issuer items of income, gain, loss and deduction were allocated pursuant to Section 7.17(l) .

 177 

(p) The Partnership Representative is authorized to amend the allocations described in this Section 7.17 as necessary to ensure that all allocations made pursuant to this Section 7.17 are treated as having substantial economic effect within the meaning of Section 704 of the Code.

 B. S&P EQUIVALENT DIVERSITY SCORE CALCULATION 
 The S&P Equivalent Diversity Score is calculated as follows 
 (a) An Issuer Par Amount is calculated for each issuer of a Collateral Obligation, and is equal to the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations issued by that issuer and all affiliates. 
 (b) An Average Par Amount is calculated by summing the Issuer Par Amounts for all issuers, and dividing by the number of issuers. 
 (c) An Equivalent Unit Score is calculated for each issuer, and is equal to the lesser of (x) one and (y) the Issuer Par Amount for such issuer divided by the Average Par Amount. 
 (d) An Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score is then calculated for each of the S&P Industry Classification groups, shown on Schedule 1(A), and is equal to the sum of the Equivalent Unit Scores for each issuer in such industry classification group. 
 (e) An Industry Diversity Score is then established for each S&P Industry Classification group, shown on Schedule 1(A), by reference to the following table for the related Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score provided that if any Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores, the applicable Industry Diversity Score will be the lower of the two Industry Diversity Scores

 2 Solely for the purpose of determining the S&P Recovery Rate for such debt obligation, no debt obligation will constitute a Senior Secured Loan or a senior secured bond unless such debt obligation (a) is secured by a valid first priority security interest in collateral, (b) in the Collateral Manager's commercially reasonable judgment (with such determination being made in good faith by the Collateral Manager at the time of such debt obligation's purchase and based upon information reasonably available to the Collateral Manager at such time and without any requirement of additional investigation beyond the Collateral Manager's customary credit review procedures), is secured by specified collateral that has a value not less than an amount equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate principal balance of all debt obligations senior or pari passu to such debt obligations and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of such debt obligation, which value may be derived from, among other things, the enterprise value (including equity and goodwill) of the issuer of such debt obligation provided , that the terms of this footnote may be amended or revised at any time by a written notice from the Issuer and the Collateral Manager to the Collateral Trustee and the Collateral Administrator (without the consent of any holder 

of any Debt), subject to the satisfaction of the S&P Rating Condition, in order to conform to S&P then-current criteria for such debt obligations and (c) is not subordinate to any other debt obligation provided , further , that if 100 of the value of such debt obligation is derived from the enterprise value of the issuer of such debt obligation, such debt obligation will have either (1) the S&P Recovery Rate specified for Unsecured Loans in the table above, or (2) the S&P Recovery Rate determined by S&P on a case by case basis. 
 3 For the avoidance of doubt, each Cov-Lite Loan that is a Senior Secured Loan will constitute a senior secured cov-lite loan . 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining the S&P Recovery Rate of a Collateral Obligation that is a Senior Secured Loan (including any Cov-Lite Loan) secured solely or primarily by common stock or other equity interests, such Collateral Obligation shall be deemed to be an Unsecured Loan.

Nothing in this Section 3.6(b) shall affect the obligation of the Co-Borrowers to pay the Lenders hereunder. 
 (c) Loan Agent Entitled to Assume Payment Not Prohibited in Absence of Notice . The Loan Agent shall not at any time be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Loan Agent unless and until a Trust Officer of the Loan Agent responsible for the administration of this Agreement has actual knowledge thereof or unless and until the Loan Agent shall have received (in its role as Loan Agent) written notice thereof from the Co-Borrowers (in the form of an Officer's certificate reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Agent), the Collateral Trustee, or persons representing themselves to be other Lenders and, prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Loan Agent, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, shall be entitled in all respects conclusively to assume that no such fact exists, and the Loan Agent shall have no liability hereunder for any payment made, or action taken, by it without such knowledge or notice.

Such Lender acknowledges that, in the event such Lender fails to provide such information or documentation for the purposes of FATCA, or to the extent that its ownership of Debt would otherwise cause the Borrower to be subject to any tax under FATCA, (A) the Borrower (and any agent acting on its behalf) is authorized to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the investor as compensation for any amounts withheld from payments to or for the benefit of the Borrower as a result of such failure or such ownership, and (B) to the extent necessary to avoid an adverse effect on the Borrower as a result of such failure or such ownership, the Borrower will have the right to compel the investor to sell its Debt and, if such person does not sell its Debt within 10 Business Days after notice from the Borrower or its agents, the Borrower will have the right to sell such Debt at a public or private sale called and conducted in any manner permitted by law, and to remit the net proceeds of such sale (taking into account, in addition to other related costs and charges, any taxes incurred by the Borrower in connection with such sale) to such person as payment in full for such Debt. The Borrower may also assign each such Debt a separate securities identifier in the Borrower s sole discretion. Each Lender agrees that the Borrower, the Collateral Trustee and or their agents or representatives may (1) provide any information and documentation concerning its investment in its Debt to the Bermuda Monetary Authority in Bermuda, the IRS and any other relevant governmental, tax or regulatory authority and (2) take such other steps as they deem necessary or helpful to ensure that the Borrower complies with FATCA and the Bermuda FATCA Legislation.

Such decisions and evaluations shall be made solely by the Collateral Manager. In response to a specific request regarding a proposed Restricted Transaction, the Independent Review Party shall determine whether the price of such Restricted Transaction is comparable to that which would be obtained in an arm s-length transaction, and if it makes such a determination, it will approve of such Restricted Transaction. 
 Each Restricted Transaction must be approved in writing by the Independent Review Party. The Independent Review Party is under no obligation to consent to a Restricted Transaction. If the Independent Review Party approves a Restricted Transaction in writing, the Issuer will effect it at the option of the Collateral Manager (subject to any other applicable restriction in the Indenture or this Agreement). If the Independent Review Party notifies the Collateral Manager that it will not approve the Restricted Transaction, the Issuer will not affect the Restricted Transaction. 
 Any Independent Review Party (i) shall either (A) be the Issuer s board of directors, (B) be an established financial institution or other financial company with experience in assessing the merits of transactions similar to the Restricted Transactions or (C) be a review board comprised of one or more individuals selected by the Issuer (or at the request of the Issuer, selected by the Collateral Manager), (ii) shall be required to assess the merits of the Restricted Transaction and either grant or withhold consent to such transaction in its sole judgment and (iii) shall not be (A) affiliated with the Collateral Manager (other than as a Holder, as a beneficial owner of Debt or as a passive investor in the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer) or (B) (other than in the case of the Issuer s Board of Directors) involved in the daily management and control of the Issuer. The initial Independent Review Party shall be the Issuer s board of directors. 
 The initial holders of the Debt, by acquisition of their Debt (or by making the Class A-1 Loans), are deemed to have (i) consented to the acquisition of the initial Collateral Obligations by the Issuer and (ii) approved the Issuer s and or the Co-Issuer s consent to the transactions and procedures described in this Section 5 relating to Restricted Transactions. 
 BUSINESS.31747005.5

 The Issuer (i) shall be responsible for any fees relating to the services provided by any Independent Review Party and shall reimburse members of any Independent Review Party for their out-of-pocket expenses and (ii) may indemnify members of such Independent Review Party to the maximum extent permitted by law, subject to terms and conditions satisfactory to the Collateral Manager.

The Collateral Manager will be required to act hereunder with respect to any information within its possession only if such information was known to those employees of the Collateral Manager responsible for performing the obligations of the Collateral Manager hereunder and only if such information is not deemed by the Collateral Manager to be confidential or non-public or subject to other limitations on its use. The Collateral Manager is not otherwise obligated to share such information. 
 It is understood that the Collateral Manager and any of its Affiliates may engage in any other business and furnish investment management and advisory services to others, including Persons which may have investment policies similar to those followed by the Collateral Manager with respect to the Assets and which may own obligations of the same class, or of the same type, as the Collateral Obligations, Eligible Investments or Equity Securities or other securities of the issuers of Collateral Obligations, Eligible Investments or Equity Securities. The Collateral Manager will be free, in its sole discretion, to make recommendations to others, or effect transactions on behalf of itself or for others, which may be the same as or different from those it recommends that the Collateral Trustee effect with respect to the Assets.

Under the terms of the 17(d) Order, if MassMutual and its Affiliates, including the external advisor to the Collateral Manager, are required to offer to the Registered Funds an opportunity to co-invest in certain Private Placements, such co-investments must meet the conditions of the 17(d) Order. Because of the Collateral Manager s and its Affiliates relationship with the Issuer, any Private Placements proposed to be purchased by the Issuer and the Registered Funds will be subject to this requirement. The Issuer may only co-invest with the Registered Funds in such Private Placements pursuant to the 17(d) Order. 
 The 17(d) Order provides that, among other things, if MassMutual or any other client of the Collateral Manager proposes to purchase a Private Placement that is consistent with the investment objectives and policies of one or more of the Registered Funds and is determined to be appropriate for such Registered Funds, such opportunity to purchase must be offered to the Registered Funds on identical terms and conditions. Additionally, if the aggregate amount of a Private Placement opportunity that has 
 BUSINESS.31747005.5 

been recommended to be invested by the Registered Funds, MassMutual and any other client of the Collateral Manager exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity available, such opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participant s capital available for investment in such asset class, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each. Accordingly, in the event that any Registered Fund elects to accept an opportunity to invest in a Private Placement, the Issuer may only be able to acquire a smaller portion of the proposed Private Placement and, in certain circumstances, may be unable to purchase other securities of the same obligor or its Affiliates. 
 The 17(d) Order also provides that if any party to the 17(d) Order proposes to sell all or dispose of any portion of a Private Placement that is also owned by a Registered Fund, such Registered Fund must be offered the opportunity to dispose of a proportionate amount of such Private Placement securities on identical terms and conditions. A similar condition applies with respect to the exercise of warrants, conversion privileges and other rights in respect of Private Placements having equity features held by a Registered Fund. A Registered Fund has five business days from the date of notification within which to make an election to participate in such disposition or exercise. 
 The Issuer agrees to comply fully with the 17(d) Order and to take all steps necessary or desirable to permit the Collateral Manager and the other parties to the 17(d) Order to comply fully with the 17(d) Order, including causing any successor investment manager to manage the Assets in a manner that will enable the Collateral Manager and other parties subject to the 17(d) Order to comply fully therewith.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the Collateral Manager shall not take any discretionary action that, in the reasonable belief of the Collateral Manager, would reasonably be expected to cause an Event of Default under the Indenture. If the Collateral Manager is ordered by the Board of Directors or the requisite Holders to take any action which would have any such consequences, the Collateral Manager shall promptly notify the Issuer, the Rating Agency and the Collateral Trustee of the Collateral Manager s judgment that such action would have one or more of the consequences set forth above and need not take such action unless the Board of Directors then requests the Collateral Manager to do so. Notwithstanding any such request, the Collateral Manager need not take such action unless arrangements satisfactory to it are made to insure or indemnify the Collateral Manager, Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and members, managers, officers, agents or employees of the Collateral Manager or such Affiliates from any liability and expense it may incur as a result of such action.
