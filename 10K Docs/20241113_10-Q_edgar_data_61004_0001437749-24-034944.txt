 Overview 
 
 The Company is a holding company engaged in services, merchant investment, and manufacturing business activities. The Company, through its manufacturing business subsidiary, is engaged in the designing, manufacturing, and marketing of high-performance Frequency and Time Reference Standards that form the basis for timing and synchronization in various applications. The Company's primary markets are communications, networking, aerospace, defense, instrumentation, and industrial markets. 
 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The LGL Group, Inc., its majority-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary. 
 
 We provide our products and services through our Electronic Instruments and Merchant Investment businesses. Activities not related to our business segments, such as our corporate operations and corporate-level assets and financial obligations, are included in Corporate. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, LGL Group had investments (classified within Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable securities) with a fair value of approximately 41.2 million, of which 24.3 million was held within the Merchant Investment business. The Company accounts for its Marketable securities under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 321, Investments - Equity Securities ("ASC 321") and as such, its Marketable securities are reported at fair value on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Electronic Instruments Business 
 
 We operate our manufacturing business currently through our subsidiary, Precise Time and Frequency, LLC ("PTF"), a globally positioned producer of industrial Electronic Instruments and commercial products and services. Founded in 2002, PTF operates from our design and manufacturing facility in Wakefield, Massachusetts. 
 
 Merchant Investment Business 
 
 The LGL investment business is comprised of various investment vehicles in which LGL is either shareholder, partner, or has general partner interests, and through which LGL invests its capital. The Company seeks to invest available cash and cash equivalents in liquid investments with a view to enhancing returns as we continue to assess further acquisitions of, or investments in, operating businesses broadly. LGL core strengths include identifying and acquiring undervalued assets and businesses, often through the purchase of securities, increasing value through management, financial or other operational changes, and managing complex legal, regulatory or financial issues, which may include technical, engineering, environmental, zoning, permitting and licensing issues among others. 
 
 Market Conditions and Search Process 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, mergers and acquisitions continued to be impacted by macroeconomic conditions such as higher borrowing costs, increased regulatory scrutiny, political uncertainty, and higher valuation expectations. The initial public offering ("IPO") market has been relatively weak with continued pressure on private equity sponsors to monetize their portfolio companies, which has improved the pace and quality of deal flow to our team. 
 
 Our search process leverages our professional networks and relationships, participation in industry events and conferences, monitoring of industry trends and news, and interactions with our shareholders, investment banks, and other intermediaries. We continue to seek small- to mid-sized opportunities with strong cash flow generating capacity that trade at reasonable multiples with competitive products or services and with defensible market positions or intellectual property. 
 
 Trends and Uncertainties 
 
 We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than global macroeconomic conditions affecting our industry generally that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on our revenues or income other than those listed below and those listed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.

Changing Interest Rates 
 
 The U.S. Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate a total of four times throughout 2023, resulting in a range from 5.25 to 5.50 as of December 31, 2023. Through the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the U.S. Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds rate twice totaling 75 basis points to a range of 4.50 to 4.75 . It is expected that the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to decrease the federal funds rate during 2024 and 2025 to, among other things, control inflation; however, the timing of any future decreases remains unclear. If interest rates continue to decline, the returns generated by our investments in U.S. Treasuries could be adversely impacted.

 Cash provided by investing activities was 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 18,816 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 18,816, primarily due to sales of IronNet, Inc. during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months from the date of this filing and for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Our Board has adhered to a practice of not paying cash dividends. This policy takes into account our long-term growth objectives, including our anticipated investments for organic growth, potential acquisitions and stockholders' desire for capital appreciation of their holdings. No cash dividends have been paid to the Company's stockholders since January 30, 1989, and none are expected to be paid for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations from December 31, 2023, a description of which may be found in Part II, Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations in the 2023 Annual Report.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying footnotes. These estimates are made and evaluated on an on-going basis using information that is currently available as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, perhaps in material adverse ways, and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions. For a discussion of the Company s critical accounting estimates, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of September 30, 2024 was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
