PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Item 2. Management s Discussion Analysis of Financial Condition Results of Operations 

Introduction 
 
 This section reviews the financial condition and results of operations of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. Some tables may include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth. When you read this discussion, you should also refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report. The page locations of specific sections and notes that we refer to are presented in the Table of Contents. 
 
 References to our 2023 Form 10-K refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which has been filed with the SEC and is available on its website www.sec.gov and on our website www.key.com/ir ). 

Terminology 
 
 Throughout this discussion, references to Key, we, our, us, and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries. KeyCorp refers solely to the parent holding company, and KeyBank refers solely to KeyCorp s subsidiary bank, KeyBank National Association. KeyBank (consolidated) refers to the consolidated entity consisting of KeyBank and its subsidiaries. 
 
 We want to explain some industry-specific terms at the outset so you can better understand the discussion that follows. 
 We use the phrase continuing operations in this document to mean all of our businesses other than our government-guaranteed and private education lending business, which are accounted for as discontinued operations . 
 We engage in capital markets activities primarily through business conducted by our Commercial Bank segment . These activities encompass a variety of products and services. Among other things, we trade securities as a dealer, enter into derivative contracts (both to accommodate clients financing needs and to mitigate certain risks), and conduct transactions in foreign currencies (to accommodate clients needs). 
 For regulatory purposes, capital is divided into two classes. Federal regulations currently prescribe that at least one-half of a bank or BHC s total risk-based capital must qualify as Tier 1 capital . Both total and Tier 1 capital serve as bases for several measures of capital adequacy, which is an important indicator of financial stability and condition. Banking regulators evaluate a component of Tier 1 capital, known as Common Equity Tier 1 , under the Regulatory Capital Rules . The Capital section of this report under the heading Capital adequacy provides more information on total capital, Tier 1 capital, and the Regulatory Capital Rules, including Common Equity Tier 1, and describes how these measures are calculated.

Strategic developments 
 
 Our actions and results during the third quarter of 2024 support our long-term targets and corporate strategy described in the Introduction section under the Corporate strategy heading on page 50 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Our relationship-based business model and our long-term strategic commitment to primacy, that is, serving as our client's primary bank, continues to serve us well, highlighted by a 4 year-over-year increase in client deposits and 3.5 net new relationship household growth annualized year-to-date. 
 Since the launch of Key Private Client last year, serving mass affluent prospects, we have continued to see growth. In the third quarter, we had over five thousand new enrollments and approximately 620 million in assets added to the platform. Overall, our Assets Under Management have now reached 61.1 billion. 
 Our continuous focus on maintaining our risk discipline has and will continue to position us to perform well through all business cycles. Net charge-offs remain at the low-end of our long-term target range of 40 to 60 basis points and have been below range the past few years. 
 Expenses remained well-controlled, down approximately 1 compared to the prior year. This implies about 400 basis points of positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis, excluding the securities portfolio repositioning. 
 We ended the quarter with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.8 (a) , up approximately 100 basis points from a year ago, including the impact of our balance sheet repositioning and the strategic minority investment by Scotiabank. 
 (a) September 30, 2024 capital ratios are estimates 
 
 In addition to the actions and results described above, we executed the following strategic actions during the third quarter of 2024: 
 
 Strategic Minority Investment by Scotiabank 
 
 On August 12, 2024, we entered into an Investment Agreement with Scotiabank pursuant to which Scotiabank agreed to make a strategic minority investment in KeyCorp of approximately 2.8 billion, representing approximately 14.9 pro forma common stock ownership of KeyCorp, for a fixed price of 17.17 per share. On August 30, 2024, Scotiabank completed the initial purchase of KeyCorp s Common Shares with an investment of approximately 821 million in gross proceeds. With this investment, Scotiabank owns approximately 4.9 of KeyCorp s common stock. The parties expect to complete the final purchase of approximately 2.0 billion of KeyCorp s common stock in the first quarter of 2025, subject to Federal Reserve approval. Refer to Note 19 Shareholders Equity for additional information on this transaction. 
 
 Securities Repositioning 
 
 On September 6, 2024, we initiated a strategic repositioning of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio by selling approximately 7.0 billion in market value of low-yielding mortgage-backed securities. The mortgage-backed securities that were sold had a weighted average book yield of approximately 2.3 and an average duration of approximately six years. Reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale was completed in October, with the new securities having an average book yield of approximately 4.95 and an average duration of approximately four years. During the third quarter of 2024, along with our customary sale of short-dated U.S. Treasuries set to mature within the quarter, we also sold approximately 3 billion in U.S. Treasuries yielding 50 basis points that were set to mature in the fourth quarter of 2024. The total pre-tax loss on sale of securities available for sale for the third quarter was 935 million of which 918 million was associated with the strategic repositioning.

Business outlook 
 
 Consistent with the forward guidance we provided on October 18, 2024, we expect these current year results, that is full year 2024 vs. full year 2023: 
 Category Expectations Average loans down 7 to 8 (a) 
 Average deposits up 1 to 2 , with client deposits up 3 to 4 Net interest income (TE) down 2 to 5 (a) 
 Noninterest income up 6 + (b) 
 Noninterest expense up ~2 (c) 
 Net charge-offs to average loans 35 to 40 basis points (FY2024) Effective tax rate ~13 (FY2024) (d) 
 
 (a) Additional Guidance: End of period loans: down 5 to 6 vs. year-end 2023 balances; Net interest income (TE): Up low-single digits vs 4Q23 annualized exit rate, 10 + 4Q24 vs 4Q23. 
 (b) Excludes the 918 million loss on sale of securities incurred from the repositioning of our available for sale investment securities portfolio in the third quarter of 2024. 
 (c) Noninterest expense guidance excludes the FDIC special assessment of 190 million, efficiency related expenses of 131 million, a pension settlement charge of 18 million recorded in 2023 and the FDIC special assessment of 28 million in 2024. 
 (d) Effective tax rate excluding the 918 million loss on sale of securities from the repositioning of our securities available for sale investment portfolio in the third quarter of 2024 would have been ~20 .

Supervision and regulation 
 
 The following discussion provides a summary of recent regulatory developments and should be read in conjunction with the disclosure included in our 2023 Form 10-K under the heading Supervision and Regulation in Item 1. Business and under the heading II. Compliance Risk in Item 1A. Risk Factors as well as the disclosure included in Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this report. 
 
 Regulatory capital requirements 
 
 KeyCorp and KeyBank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the Basel III international capital framework Basel III ). The Basel III capital framework and the U.S. implementation of the Basel III capital framework Regulatory Capital Rules are discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business of our 2023 Form 10-K under the heading Supervision and Regulation Regulatory capital requirements. 
 
 Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, standardized approach banking organizations, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank, are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in Figure 1 below. At September 30, 2024, KeyCorp s ratios under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules were as set forth in Figure 1.

 (b) As of October 1, 2024, KeyCorp s stress capital buffer is 3.1 . Stress capital buffer must consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5 imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the Regulatory Capital Rules. 
 (c) September 30, 2024 ratios are estimated and reflect the five-year transition of CECL impacts on regulatory ratios. 

Revised prompt corrective action framework 
 
 The federal prompt corrective action PCA framework under the FDIA groups FDIC-insured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. In addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States, the Regulatory Capital Rules also revised the PCA capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank, with an effective date of January 1, 2015. The revised PCA framework table in Figure 2 identifies the capital category thresholds for a well capitalized and an adequately capitalized institution under the PCA Framework.

 (b) As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyBank is not subject to the 3 supplementary leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January 1, 2018. However, KeyCorp will be subject to the supplementary leverage ratio if proposed revisions to the Regulatory Capital Rules discussed below are adopted. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, KeyBank (consolidated) satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered well capitalized for purposes of the PCA framework. However, investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyBank because the PCA framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function. Moreover, it is important to note that the PCA framework does not apply to BHCs, like KeyCorp. 

Capital planning and stress testing 
 
 KeyCorp is a Category IV banking organization subject to a supervisory stress test every other year. On June 26, 2024, the Federal Reserve announced the results of the supervisory stress test that it conducted of 31 BHCs having more than 100 billion in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). The Federal Reserve indicated that all BHCs subject to the stress test maintained capital ratios above the minimum required levels under the severely adverse scenario. The stress test results for individual BHCs (including KeyCorp) were used by the Federal Reserve to determine a BHC s updated stress capital buffer requirement. The Federal Reserve published the updated stress capital buffer requirements on August 28, 2024. KeyCorp s updated stress capital buffer is 3.1 . This stress capital buffer became effective on October 1, 2024 and will remain in effect until September 30, 2025, unless KeyCorp later receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the Federal Reserve.

Deposit insurance and assessments 
 
 On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule, applicable to all insured depository institutions (including KeyBank), to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by two basis points consistent with the Amended Restoration Plan approved by the FDIC on June 21, 2022. The FDIC indicated that it was taking this action in order to restore the DIF reserve ratio to the required statutory minimum of 1.35 by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. Under the final rule, the increase in rates began with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023 and will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds 2 in order to support growth in the DIF in progressing toward the FDIC s long-term goal of a 2 reserve ratio. On March 10, 2023, and March 12, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank SVB and Signature Bank Signature were closed by the state banking authorities in California and New York, respectively, and the FDIC was appointed as receiver of SVB and Signature. All deposits of SVB and Signature were transferred to bridge banks established by the FDIC under the systemic risk exception to the least cost test in the FDIA so that the uninsured deposits as well as the insured deposits of both banks were protected by the FDIC. Under the FDIA, the loss to the DIF arising from the use of the systemic risk exception must be recovered through one or more special assessments. 
 
 On November 16, 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to impose a special assessment on IDIs to recover the loss to the DIF resulting from the use of the systemic risk exception to protect the uninsured depositors of SVB and Signature. Under the final rule, the FDIC would collect a special assessment from IDIs at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods, starting with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024. The assessment base for the proposed special assessment is equal to an IDI s estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first 5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits held by the IDI. Because the estimated loss to the DIF from the use of the systemic risk exception will be periodically adjusted and because the total assessments collected may change due to corrective amendments filed by covered IDIs regarding the reported amount of uninsured deposits for the December 31, 2022 reporting period, the FDIC may cease collection of the special assessment early, extend the special assessment collection period, or impose a final shortfall special assessment. 
 
 In the final rule, the FDIC indicated that the special assessment is a tax-deductible operating expense for IDIs, and that it assumed that the effect on income of the entire amount of the special assessment would occur in one quarter for the IDIs subject to the assessment. The initial impact of the special assessment to Key was approximately 190 million in pre-tax expense, which was recognized upon issuance of the final rule in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 The FDIC has indicated that the loss estimates to be recovered by the special assessment will be periodically adjusted as the FDIC (as receiver of the failed banks) sells assets, satisfies liabilities, and incurs receivership expenses. The FDIC said that it will provide any updates regarding the amount and collection period for the special assessment when it sends the quarterly deposit insurance assessment invoices to the IDIs subject to the special assessment. In the first quarter of 2024, the FDIC announced an increase in its estimate of losses from protecting the uninsured depositors of SVB and Signature and, therefore, increased the amount that it would collect through the special assessment. Because of this updated estimate, Key incurred an incremental pre-tax expense of 29 million in the first quarter of 2024. Based on the quarterly invoices Key received from the FDIC in June 2024 and September 2024, Key recorded an incremental pre-tax expense of 5 million in the second quarter of 2024 and a reversal of pre-tax expense of 6 million in the third quarter of 2024 to true-up initial estimates to invoiced amounts. 
 
 The FDIC s final rule for a special assessment discussed above was not intended to recover the loss to the DIF from the failure of First Republic Bank in May 2023 (initially estimated as a 13 billion loss) or to the DIF from the failures of SVB and Signature that was not related to the protection of uninsured depositors (initially estimated as a 2.7 billion loss). The FDIC indicated that no further adjustments to assessments are contemplated at this time to recover those losses but that it will re-evaluate this issue in the future when it updates projections for the DIF balance and the reserve ratio in connection with its periodic review of the DIF Restoration Plan that was adopted in 2022. The FDIC updates these projections at least semiannually.

Resolution and recovery plans 
 
 On June 20, 2024, the FDIC adopted a final rule to amend and restate its current resolution plan rule in order to clarify and strengthen resolution plan submission requirements and reflect lessons learned since the adoption of the FDIC s current resolution plan rule in 2012. Among other things, the final rule (i) requires IDIs with more than 100 billion in total assets that are affiliated with a U.S. G-SIB to submit full resolution plans every two years, (ii) requires IDIs with more than 100 billion in total assets that are not affiliated with a U.S. G-SIB (including KeyBank) to submit full resolution plans every three years, (iii) requires IDIs with total assets between 50 billion and 100 billion to submit informational filings every three years, (iv) requires triennial filers to submit more limited supplements in the off years, (v) enhances and clarifies the requirements for the content of resolution submissions, (vi) codifies certain aspects of guidance and feedback provided to filers subject to the current rule, (vii) expands expectations regarding engagement and capabilities testing, and (viii) establishes an enhanced credibility standard for the evaluation of resolution submissions. The final rule was effective on October 1, 2024. KeyBank is required to file its next resolution plan by July 1, 2025, which will be its initial filing under the final rule. 
 
 On October 21, 2024, the OCC adopted revisions to its recovery planning guidelines. The OCC s recovery planning guidelines require large OCC-regulated banks to develop and maintain a recovery plan that identifies triggers and options for responding to a wide range of severe internal and external stress scenarios so that the bank can be restored to financial strength and viability in a timely manner if it were to experience such stress situations. The OCC revised these guidelines to (i) expand the applicability of the guidelines to banks with at least 100 billion in average total consolidated assets, (ii) add a requirement for covered banks to test their recovery plans to ensure that their plans will be effective during periods of severe stress, and (iii) clarify that recovery plans should consider non-financial risks (including operational and strategic risks) as well as financial risks. KeyBank will be subject to the OCC s revised recovery planning guidelines. KeyBank is required to be in compliance with these guidelines by January 1, 2026 except that KeyBank s compliance with the testing requirement is delayed until January 1, 2027.

 Personal Financial Data Rights 
 
 On October 22, 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule to implement Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which gives individuals the right to obtain data regarding consumer financial products and services they have obtained. The final rule requires financial institutions (including KeyBank) and other financial service providers (collectively data providers to make available to consumers and authorized third parties, upon request, data in the data provider s possession or control concerning covered consumer financial products or services (including credit cards, deposit accounts, and other accounts that facilitate payments) in an electronic form usable by the consumer and authorized third parties. The data that must be provided includes account balance information, at least 24 months of transaction history, pricing information, information on upcoming third-party bill payments, and account verification information. The data providers are required to create and maintain consumer and developer interfaces that will be able to transfer the data. A data provider will not be allowed to charge any fees or other charges for making the covered data available or for maintaining the required interfaces. The CFPB indicated that it adopted this rule in order to foster competition and consumer choice and said that this rule is a step towards bringing about an open banking system in the United States. Compliance with the rule will be phased in over several years with KeyBank required to be compliance by April 1, 2027. Following the issuance of this rule, two trade associations and a national bank headquartered in Kentucky filed a lawsuit challenging the rule in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. In this lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged that the CFPB exceeded its statutory authority in adopting the rule. Key is monitoring developments in this case.

Results of Operations 

Earnings overview 
 
 The following chart provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to the three months ended September 30, 2024 (dollars in millions): 

Net interest income 
 
 One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including: 
 
 the volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; 
 the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital; 
 the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk; 
 interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; 
 asset quality; and 
 fair value accounting of acquired earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 
 
 To make it easier to compare both the results across several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a TE basis (i.e., as if all income were taxable and at the same rate). For example, 100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as 126, an amount that, if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 , would yield 100.

Table of contents 

Net interest income (TE) was 964 million for the third quarter of 2024 and the net interest margin was 2.17 . Compared to the third quarter of 2023, net interest income (TE) increased 41 million and net interest margin increased by 16 basis points. Both net interest income and the net interest margin benefited from the reinvestment of proceeds from maturing investment securities into higher yielding investments, the maturity of lower-yielding interest rate swaps with negative carry, and a shift in funding mix from higher-cost wholesale borrowings to lower-cost interest-bearing deposits. In addition, during the third quarter of 2024, Key began the repositioning of the available-for-sale portfolio, which involved the sale of approximately 7.0 billion in market value of lower-yielding mortgaged-backed securities and reinvestment of the proceeds into higher-yielding investments. These benefits were partially offset by a decline in loan balances and higher deposit costs relative to a year ago. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income (TE) was 2.7 billion, and the net interest margin was 2.08 . Compared to the same period in the prior year, net interest income (TE) decreased 266 million and the net interest margin decreased by 12 basis points. The decline in net interest income (TE) and the net interest margin reflects lower loan balances, in part due to Key s balance sheet optimization efforts during the second half of 2023, and higher deposit costs, partly due to a shift in funding mix from noninterest-bearing deposits to higher-cost deposits. Net interest income (TE) and the net interest margin benefited from higher earning asset yields as a result of the higher interest rate environment, maturing interest rate swaps, and the reinvestment of proceeds from maturing investment securities into higher-yielding investments. 
 
 Average loans were 106.2 billion for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 11.4 billion compared to the third quarter of 2023, reflective of Key's planned balance sheet optimization efforts in 2023, and continued tepid client loan demand. The decline in average loans was mostly driven by a 8.5 billion decline in average commercial loans, due to lower commercial and industrial loans and commercial mortgage real estate loans. Additionally, average consumer loans declined by 2.9 billion, reflective of broad-based declines across all consumer loan categories. 
 
 Average deposits totaled 147.8 billion for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 2.9 billion compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting growth in both consumer and commercial deposits. 
 
 Figure 3 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates for the current periods and comparative year ago periods. This figure also presents a

reconciliation of TE net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding, is calculated by dividing annualized TE net interest income by average earning assets.

Provision for credit losses 
 
 Key s provision for credit losses was 95 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 81 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase from the year-ago period reflects continuing but slowing credit portfolio migration, higher net charge-offs and changes in economic outlook, partly offset by balance sheet optimization efforts. The provision for credit losses was 296 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 387 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Noninterest income 
 
 As shown in Figure 4, noninterest income was a net loss of 269 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income of 643 million, for the year-ago quarter. The net loss was driven by the 918 million loss on sale incurred from the strategic repositioning of our securities available for sale portfolio. Noninterest income was 1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change.

Figure 4. Noninterest Income 

Trust and investment services income 
 
 Trust and investment services income consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management fees, and insurance income. The assets under management that primarily generate certain trust and asset management fees are shown in Figure 5. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, trust and investment services income was up 10 million, or 7.7 , compared to the same period one year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, trust and investment services income was up 31 million, or 8.1 , compared to the same period one year ago. This increase for both periods was driven primarily by brokerage fee income and investment management fees associated with higher assets under management. 
 
 A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. As shown in Figure 5, at September 30, 2024, our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of 61.1 billion, up 16.4 compared to September 30, 2023 . The increase was driven by new business and market impacts on portfolios offset slightly by run-off.

 Investment banking and debt placement fees 
 
 Investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees, debt and equity securities underwriting fees, merger and acquisition and financial advisory fees, gains on sales of commercial mortgages, and agency origination fees. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, investment banking and debt placement fees were up 30 million, or 21.3 , compared to the same period one year ago, driven by debt and equity underwriting and syndication fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investment banking and debt placement fees increased 61 million, or 15.0 , compared to the same period one year ago. These increases were driven by debt and equity underwriting, mergers and acquisition, and syndication fees. 
 
 Service charges on deposit accounts 
 
 Service charges on deposit accounts decreased 2 million, or 2.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period one year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, service charges on deposit accounts decreased by 9 million, or 4.4 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The declines were driven primarily by decreased maintenance and overdraft fees slightly offset by increased account analysis fees. 
 
 Cards and payments income 
 
 Cards and payments income, which consists of debit card, prepaid card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, decreased 6 million, or 6.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period one year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in debit interchange fees and merchant services income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cards and payment income decreased 10 million, or 3.9 , from the same period one year ago, primarily as a result of lower debit interchange fees and credit card fee income. 
 
 Other noninterest income 
 
 Other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains, corporate services income, 
 corporate-owned life insurance income, consumer mortgage income, commercial mortgage servicing fees, and other income. Other noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 9 million, or 4.2 , from the year-ago quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other noninterest income increased 13 million, or 2.1 , from the same period one year ago. These decreases were primarily due to the 918 million loss reflected in other income as a result of the securities repositioning activity undertaken in the third quarter of 2024, as well as decreases in corporate services income, with a slight offset from an increase in commercial mortgage servicing fees. 

Noninterest expense 
 
 As shown in Figure 6, noninterest expense was 1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2023. Noninterest expense was 3.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.

Figure 6. Noninterest Expense 
 
 (a) Other noninterest expense includes equipment, operating lease expense, marketing, and other expense. See the "Consolidated Statements of Income" in Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 

Personnel 
 
 Personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by 7 million, or 1.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period one year ago. The increase reflects higher incentive and stock-based compensation from strong capital markets activity as well the impact of a higher stock price on stock-based compensation compared to one year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, personnel expense decreased by 6 million, or 0.3 , compared to the same period one year ago, driven primarily by a decrease in salaries expense from a reduction in head count from the prior period. 
 
 Nonpersonnel expense 
 
 Nonpersonnel expense includes net occupancy, computer processing, business services and professional fees, equipment, operating lease expense, marketing, and other miscellaneous expense categories. Nonpersonnel expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 23 million, or 5.1 , from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a decrease in marketing expense and other miscellaneous expenses, offset slightly by an increase in computer processing expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other nonpersonnel expense including the impact of the additional FDIC special assessment of 28 million, decreased 40 million, or 2.9 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreases across most other expense categories, offset slightly by an increase in computer processing expense.

Income taxes 
 
 We recorded a tax benefit of 95 million for the third quarter of 2024 and tax expense of 65 million for the third quarter of 2023. The tax benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2024 resulted primarily from the 918 million loss on the sale of securities incurred as part of a strategic repositioning of our securities portfolio. We recorded tax expense of 26 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 204 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our federal tax expense and effective tax rate differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate; primarily due to investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, tax credits associated with low-income housing investments, and periodic adjustments to our tax reserves. 
 
 Additional information pertaining to how our tax expense (benefit) and the resulting effective tax rates were derived is included in Note 14 Income Taxes beginning on page 157 of our 2023 Form 10-K.

Commercial and industrial. Commercial and industrial loans are the largest component of our loan portfolio, representin g 50 of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2024, and 50 at December 31, 2023. This portfolio is approxim a tely 89 variable rate and co nsists of loans originated primarily to large corporate, middle market, and small business clients. 
 
 Commercial and industrial loans totaled 52.8 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 3.0 billion, or 5.4 , compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease was broad-based across most industry categories and reflects the residual impact of our balance sheet optimization efforts. 
 
 Commercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate portfolio includes project loans primarily focused in market-rate and affordable multi-family housing loans, owner-occupied commercial and industrial operating company buildings, and community center grocer-anchored retail centers. These three commercial real estate segments make up 76 of our commercial real estate portfolio. Our non-owner-occupied portfolio is focused on operators of commercial real estate who not only utilize our loan products, but also utilize our broader industry-focused products and services and provide consistent pipelines into our agency, CMBS, and other long-term market take out products. This focus ensures our relationship clients foster and build portfolios with stable, recurring cash flows, with adequate, balanced cash reserves to support our balance sheet exposures through the economic cycle. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, commercial real estate loans totaled 16.7 billion, which includes 13.6 billion of mortgage loans and 3.1 billion of construction loans. Compared to December 31, 2023, this portfolio decreased 1.5 billion, or 8.3 , driven by decreases in nonowner-occupied. Nonowner-occupied properties, generally properties for which

Table of contents 

at least 50 of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties, represented 80 of total commercial real estate loans outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Since the global financial crisis in 2008, we have limited our construction business and reduced our overall construction loans from 42 to 18 of commercial real estate loans as of September 30, 2024. Construction loans provide a stream of funding for properties not fully leased at origination to support debt service payments over the term of the contract or project. As of September 30, 2024, 81 of our construction portfolio are multi-family project loans. Our office exposure only represents 5 of commercial real estate loans at period end. 

As shown in Figure 9, our commercial real estate loan portfolio includes various property types and geographic locations of the underlying collateral. These loans include commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank.

Consumer loan portfolio 
 
 Consumer loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024, totaled 32.9 billion, a decrease of 2.1 billion, or 6.0 , from December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by declines across all consumer loan categories and reflect the higher interest rate environment and our focus on originating salable loans. 
 
 The residential mortgage portfolio is comprised of loans originated by our Consumer Bank and is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024, represen ting 61 of con sumer loans outstanding. This is followed by our home equity portfolio representing 20 of consumer loans outstanding at September 30, 2024.

We held the first lien position for approxim ately 65 of the home equity portfolio at September 30, 2024, and 64 at December 31, 2023. For loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. Regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent FICO scores as well as updated loan-to-value ratios. This information is used in establishing the ALLL. Our methodology is described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under the heading Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses of our 2023 Form 10-K.

 In the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approx imately 7.7 billion of the 572.1 billion of loans administered or serviced at September 30, 2024. Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 17 Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees under the heading Recourse agreement with FNMA. 
 
 We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as Consumer mortgage income and Commercial mortgage servicing fees from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing loans. Additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in Note 8 Mortgage Servicing Assets ). 

Securities 
 
 Our securities portfolio is constructed to help manage overall interest rate risk and provide a source of liquidity, including holding securities used to accommodate pledging requirements. Our securities portfolio totaled 41.9 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 45.8 billion at December 31, 2023. Available-for-sale securities were 34.2 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 37.2 billion at December 31, 2023. Held-to-maturity securities were 7.7 billion at September 30, 2024, and 8.6 billion at December 31, 2023. 

As shown in Figure 13, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at amortized cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. For more information about these securities, refer to our 2023 Form 10-K within Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under the heading Securities and Note 6 Fair Value Measurements under the heading Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques.

Securities available for sale 
 
 The majority of our securities available for sale portfolio consists of Federal Agency CMOs and mortgage-backed securities. CMOs are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. In September 2024, we initiated a strategic repositioning of our securities available for sale portfolio by selling approximately 7.0 billion in market value of low-yielding mortgage-backed securities. The investment securities that were sold had a weighted average book yield of approximately 2.3 and an average duration of approximately six years. Reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale was completed in October of 2024, with the new securities having an average book yield of approximately 4.95 and an average duration of approximately four years. During the third quarter of 2024, along with our customary sale of short-dated U.S. Treasuries set to mature within the quarter, we also sold approximately 3 billion in U.S. Treasuries yielding 50 basis points that were set to mature in the fourth quarter of 2024. We contemplate executing a similar repositioning upon the second closing of the strategic minority investment from Scotiabank, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2025 and is subject to Federal Reserve approval. Any contemplated securities repositioning is subject to market conditions and satisfaction of all regulatory requirements. Figure 14 shows the composition, yields, and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale. For more information about these securities, including gross unrealized gains and losses by type of security and securities pledged, see Note 6 Securities ).

Our highly diversified deposit base is our primary source of funding. At September 30, 2024, our deposits totaled 150.4 billion, an increase of 4.8 billion, compared to December 31, 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, we replaced approximately 4.5 billion of FHLB advances with lower-cost client deposits. 
 
 Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit or similar state deposit insurance regimes and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit accounts that are classified as deposits and not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes. Figure 17 presents estimated uninsured deposits for the noted periods which reflect amounts disclosed in KeyBank s Call Report adjusted for intercompany deposits, which are not customer facing and are eliminated in consolidation, and accrued interest.

 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 14.8 billion of uninsured deposits were collateralized by government-backed securities compared to 13.1 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Wholesale funds, consisting of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, totaled 18.1 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 22.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease of 4.5 billion reflects a reduction of FHLB funding that was replaced with lower-cost client deposits. Wholesale funding supplements client deposit funding and may rise or fall with seasonal or other funding needs. For more information regarding our wholesale funds, see Part II, Item 2. Management s Discussion Analysis of Financial Condition Results of Operations under the heading Risk Management - Liquidity risk management of this report. 

Capital 
 
 The objective of capital management is to maintain capital levels consistent with our risk appetite and of a sufficient amount to operate under a wide range of economic conditions. Our current capital levels position us well to execute against our capital priorities including supporting organic growth and paying dividends. 
 
 The following sections discuss certain ways we have deployed our capital. For further information, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and Note 19 Shareholders' Equity ).

Table of contents 

Dividends 
 
 Consistent with our capital plan, we paid a quarterly dividend of .205 per Common Share for the third quarter of 2024. Further information regarding the capital planning process and CCAR is included under the heading Capital planning and stress testing beginning on page 16 in the Supervision and Regulation section of our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Common shares outstanding 
 
 Our Common Shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol KEY with 27,470 holders of record at September 30, 2024. Our book value per Common Share was 14.53 based on 991.3 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2024, compared to 13.02 per Common Share based on 936.6 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, our tangible book value per Common Share was 11.72, compared to 10.02 per Common Share at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Figure 18 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding Common Shares over the past five quarters.

As shown above, Common Shares outstanding increased by 48.1 million shares during the third quarter of 2024, primarily attributable to shares in connection with the strategic minority investment by Scotiabank. We did not complete any open market share repurchases in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 265.5 million treasury shares, compared to 320.1 million treasury shares at December 31, 2023. The decrease in treasury shares during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to the issuance of 47.8 million shares to Scotiabank in connection with the first closing of the strategic minority investment. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes. 
 
 Information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds of this report. 
 
 Capital adequacy 
 
 Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at September 30, 2024. Our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse operating environment while continuing to serve our clients needs, as well as to meet the Regulatory Capital Rules described in Item 1. Business of our 2023 Form 10-K under the heading Supervision and Regulation. Our shareholders equity to assets ratio was 8.9 and 7.8 at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.2 and 5.1 at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. See the section entitled GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations, which presents the computations of certain financial measures related to tangible common equity. The minimum capital and leverage ratios under the Regulatory Capital Rules together with the ratios of KeyCorp at September 30, 2024, are set forth in the Supervision and regulation Regulatory capital requirements section in Part I, Item 2 of this report.

Risk Management 

Overview 
 
 Like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. The most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, operational, liquidity, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring that we properly identify, measure, and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness, and to maximize profitability. Our definition, philosophy, and approach to risk management have not materially changed from the discussion presented under the heading Risk Management beginning on page 74 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Market risk management 
 
 Market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities, will reduce Key s income and the value of its portfolios. These factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. We are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. Information regarding our fair value policies, procedures, and methodologies is provided in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under the heading Fair Value Measurements on page 111 of our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 5 Fair Value Measurements in this report. 
 
 Trading market risk 
 
 Key incurs market risk as a result of trading activities that are used in support of client facilitation and hedging activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses. Key has exposures to a wide range of risk factors including interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. Our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets, including securitization exposures. At September 30, 2024, we did not have any re-securitization positions. We maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk. The risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the Market Risk policies. The majority of our positions are traded in active markets. 
 
 Market risk management is an integral part of Key s risk culture. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of trading market risks. The ERM Committee and the Market Risk Committee regularly review and discuss market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities. Market risk policies and procedures have been defined and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment. For more information regarding monitoring of trading positions and the activities related to Market Risk Rule compliance, see Market Risk Management beginnin g on page 76 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 VaR and stressed VaR. VaR is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. Stressed VaR is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. The MRM calculates VaR and stressed VaR at various confidence levels daily, and the results are closely monitored. VaR and stressed VaR results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations. 
 
 We use a historical simulation VaR model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other non-covered positions. Historical moves in risk factors across various asset classes are incorporated in VaR metrics. Additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancellable provisions. VaR is calculated using daily observations over a one-year lookback period and approximates a 95 confidence level. Statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than VaR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. For more information regarding our VaR model, its governance, and assumptions, see Market Risk Management on page 76 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Actual losses for the total covered portfolios did not exceed aggregate daily VaR for any day during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and did not exceed aggregate daily VaR for any day during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The MRM backtests our VaR model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. The test 
 35 

Table of contents 

compares VaR model results at the 99 confidence level to daily held profit and loss. Results of backtesting are provided to the Market Risk Committee. Backtesting exceptions occur when daily held profit and loss exceed VaR. We do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. Our net VaR approach incorporates diversification, but our VaR calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives. 
 
 The aggregate VaR at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for all covered positions was 1.3 million at September 30, 2024, and 1.7 million at September 30, 2023. Figure 20 summarizes our VaR at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023.

Stressed VaR is calculated by running the portfolios through a predetermined stress period which is approved by the Market Risk Committee and is calculated at the 99 confidence level using the same model and assumptions used for general VaR. The aggregate stressed VaR for all covered positions was 2.9 million at September 30, 2024, and 4.3 million at September 30, 2023. Figure 21 summarizes our stressed VaR at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. The decrease in stressed VaR was primarily due to a change in the size and composition of our fixed income inventory.

Market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. Our risk-weighted assets include a market risk-equivalent asset amount, which consists of a VaR component, stressed VaR component, a de minimis exposure amount, and a specific risk add-on including the securitization positions. The aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the Market Risk Rule was 21 million at September 30, 2024, all of which were mortgage-backed security positions. Specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. Market risk weighted assets, including the specific risk calculations, are run quarterly by the MRM in accordance with the Market Risk Rule, and approved by the Chief Market Risk Officer. 
 
 Nontrading market risk 
 
 Most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the Board approved ERM policy. 
 
 Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors, including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, changes in market interest rates that affect client activity, and our hedging, investing, funding, and 
 36 

Table of contents 

capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, and option risk. 
 
 Reprice risk is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (e.g., deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time. 
 Basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes. 
 Yield curve risk is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve. 
 Option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterparty s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities, or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. Option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation. 
 
 The management of nontrading market risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of nontrading market risk. The ERM Committee, the ALCO, and the Treasury Risk Oversight Committee TROC review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above. In addition, the ALCO reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk. These committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. The A/LM policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the ALCO. The MRM, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight. 
 
 Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a view of macroeconomic conditions and scenarios. The modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with management's desired interest rate risk positioning. The simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease from current levels over the next 12 months (subject to a floor on market interest rates at zero). 
 
 Figure 22 presents the results of the simulation analysis at September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was relatively neutral. The exposure to declining rates has changed from 0.89 as of September 30, 2023 to (0.06) as of September 30, 2024, as a result of the change in balance sheet mix and positioning. Tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual, parallel 200 basis point increase or 200 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 5.5 . Current modeled exposure is within Board approved tolerances. If a tolerance level is breached and determined inconsistent with risk appetite, the development of a remediation plan is required to reduce exposure back to within tolerance.

Simulation analyses produce an estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumption inputs within the model. Assumptions are tailored to the specific interest rate environment and validated on a regular basis. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analyses due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, changes in management s desired interest rate risk positioning, investment, funding and hedging activities or repercussions from exogenous events .

Table of contents 

Regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses are performed on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. Assessments are performed using different yield curve shapes, including steepening or flattening of the curve, immediate changes in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions: loan and deposit balances, the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies. 
 
 The results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in Figure 22. Net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate changes and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. If fixed rate assets increase by 1 billion, or fixed rate liabilities decrease by 1 billion, then the potential benefit to declining rates would increase by approximately 25 basis points. A five percentage point increase or decrease in the interest-bearing deposit beta assumption changes the current simulation results by approximately 110 basis points. 
 
 The current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. Corporate Treasury discretionary activities related to funding, investing, and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in management s desired interest rate risk positioning. As changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change the interest rate risk profile. 
 
 Simulations are also conducted that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a similar manner to those based on a 12-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, changes in the EVE are calculated as discussed in the following section. 
 
 Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12-, 24-, and 36-month horizons. EVE modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment. As of September 30, 2024, EVE policy limits are measured against a +/-200 basis point scenario. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as forward expectations. Remediation plans are similarly developed if the analysis indicates that the EVE will decrease by 15 or more in response to an instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates. The position is within these guidelines as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Management of interest rate exposure. The results of the various interest rate risk analyses are used to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, risk positions are managed by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives. Interest rate swaps and options are predominantly used, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities. 

Figure 23 shows all swap positions held for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swap. The volume, maturity, and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently to reflect broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk profile, see Note 7 Derivatives and Hedging Activities ).

Liquidity risk management 
 
 Liquidity risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in cash flows of assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions. 
 
 Governance structure 
 We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on a consolidated basis. This approach considers the funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. The approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding. 
 
 The management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. Oversight and governance is provided by the Board, the ERM Committee, the ALCO, the TROC, and the Chief Risk Officer. The Asset Liability Management Policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the ALCO. The Corporate Treasury Oversight group within the MRM, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight. Our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the Federal Reserve Board s Enhanced Prudential Standards. 
 
 These committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, internal liquidity stress tests, and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends, and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. When liquidity pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more frequent. 
 
 Factors affecting liquidity 
 
 Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, global pandemics, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund, or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources. For a discussion of certain risks which may impact our liquidity, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" on pages 25-41 of our 2023 Form 10-K. For more information on recent liquidity activity, see the header "Our liquidity position and recent activity" in this report below. 
 
 Our credit ratings and rating agency outlooks at September 30, 2024, are shown in Figure 24. While we believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable KeyCorp or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors, downgrades in our credit ratings could increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us. On August 14, 2024, Moody s improved its outlook from negative to stable for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. On October 3, 2024 Fitch updated KeyCorp s and KeyBank s outlooks from stable to positive.

Managing liquidity risk 
 
 Most of our liquidity risk is derived from our business model, which involves taking in deposits, many of which can be withdrawn at any time, and lending them out in the form of illiquid loan assets. The assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under stressed environments. We manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite, and within Board-approved policy limits. 
 
 We regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of internal liquidity stress test scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly internal stress test for KeyCorp. When we sense or detect emerging conditions that may strain liquidity, we may conduct internal liquidity stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment. Our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. Internal liquidity stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed. 
 
 Our primary source of funding for KeyBank are customer deposits resulting in a consolidated loan-to-deposit ratio of 71 as of September 30, 2024. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or on-balance sheet liquid reserves. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing, and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. As part of the plan, we maintain on-balance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio, which consists of high quality liquid assets. During a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. Figure 25 shows our available contingent liquidity at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, our secured term borrowings were 4.8 billion, a decrease of 4.5 billion from the prior quarter, reflecting a reduction of FHLB funding that was replaced with lower-cost client deposits.

 Liquidity programs 
 
 We have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 20 Long-term Debt beginning on page 169 of our 2023 Form 10-K, that are designed to enable KeyCorp and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. These liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the Board and are renewed and replaced as necessary. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs. 
 
 Liquidity for KeyCorp 
 
 The primary source of liquidity for KeyCorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from KeyBank. KeyCorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions); support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences; and fund capital distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks. 
 
 We use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity. The parent cash coverage months metric measures the number of months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current quantity of liquidity. We generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from KeyBank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels. KeyCorp, the parent company, generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months. At September 30, 2024, KeyCorp held 4.5 billion in cas h and short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance. 
 
 Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. KeyCorp did not issue any debt during the third quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, KeyBank paid 270 million cash dividends to KeyCorp. As of September 30, 2024, KeyBank had regulatory capacity to pay 1.8 billion in dividends to KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval. 
 
 Our liquidity position and recent activity 
 
 Over the past quarter, our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has increased primarily due to an increase in Key's cash position. The liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution. On August 12, 2024, we entered into an Investment Agreement with Scotiabank pursuant to which Scotiabank agreed to make a strategic minority investment in KeyCorp of approximately 2.8 billion, representing approximately 14.9 pro forma common stock ownership of KeyCorp. On August 30, 2024, Scotiabank completed the initial purchase of KeyCorp s Common Shares with an investment of approximately 821 million in gross proceeds. With this investment, Scotiabank owns approximately 4.9 of KeyCorp s Common Shares. The parties expect to complete the final purchase of approximately 2.0 billion of KeyCorp s Common Shares in the first quarter of 2025, subject to Federal Reserve approval. Refer to Note 19 Shareholders Equity for additional information on this transaction. 
 
 From time to time, KeyCorp or KeyBank may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares, or Common Shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Additional information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 5. Market

Risk Factors of this report. 

Credit risk management 
 
 Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, distribute credit risk, purchase securities, provide financial and payments products, and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk. 
 
 Credit policy, approval, and evaluation 
 
 We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee approves management credit policies and recommends significant credit policies to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, the KeyBank Board, and the Risk Committee of the KeyCorp Board for approval. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit . 
 
 Our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business, to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority, are responsible for credit approval. Individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies. It is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, however, a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations. 
 
 Our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. These models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. The scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. We periodically validate the loan scoring processes. 
 
 We maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios. For individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower. 
 
 Allowance for loan and lease losses 
 
 We estimate the appropriate level of the ALLL on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under the heading Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses beginning on page 109 of our 2023 Form 10-K. Briefly, the ALLL estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on our historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other relevant factors. The ALLL at September 30, 2024, represents our best estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date. 
 
 As shown in Figure 26, our ALLL from continuing operations decreased by 14 million, or 0.9 , from December 31, 2023. The commercial ALLL increased by 50 million, or 4.7 , from December 31, 2023, through September 30, 2024. Our consumer ALLL decreased by 64 million, or 14.3 , from December 31, 2023, through September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 4 Asset Quality within this report for further discussion of changes in the ALLL.

 Figure 27 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 29. Figure 28 shows the ratios of net charge-offs by loan category as a percentage of the respective average loan balance. 
 
 Net loan charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 83 million compared to the year-ago quarter. Approximately 80 million of charge offs recognized in the third quarter of 2024 consisted of three large credits, two consumer goods companies and one equipment manufacturing company. These three obligations were collateral dependent and had approximately 60 million in specifically allocated reserves which were in place prior to the third quarter of 2024.

Operational and compliance risk management 
 
 Like all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. These events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities. Operational risk intersects with compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation. This heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk. While operational and compliance risk are separate risk disciplines in KeyCorp s ERM framework, losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs are included in operational loss reporting and could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, or harm to our reputation. 
 45 

Table of contents 

We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board. 
 
 The Operational Risk Management Program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the content, to manage operational risk for Key. The Compliance Risk Management Program serves the same function in managing compliance risk for Key. The Operational Risk Committee and the Compliance Risk Committee support the ERM Committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks, and discussing forward-looking assessments. Both the Operational Risk Committee and the Compliance Risk Committee include attendees from each of the Three Lines of Defense. Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. The Operational Risk Committee and Compliance Risk Committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities. These committees and the Operational Risk Management and Compliance Risk Management functions are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management and Compliance Risk Management Programs and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee and updates the Risk Committee, as appropriate, on matters related to the oversight of these controls.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not 
 audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, 
 they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, nor as a substitute for analyses 
 of results as reported under GAAP. 
 
 The tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases.

 The cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures, adjusted noninterest expense and total taxable-equivalent revenue. Accordingly, there is no directly comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. We believe this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. Additionally, this ratio is used by analysts and investors to evaluate how effectively management is controlling noninterest expenses in generating revenue, as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies beginning on page 107 of our 2023 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies of this report should also be reviewed for more information on accounting standards that have been adopted during the period. 
 
 In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them. 
 47 

Table of contents 

We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions, and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the ALLL; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. In addition, we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities. A brief discussion of each of these areas appe ars on pages 90 through 95 of our 2023 Form 10-K. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 Effective in the first quarter of 2024, we realigned our real estate capital business from our Commercial Bank reporting unit to our Institutional Bank reporting unit. The move was done to align product-based teams to the client-facing businesses they serve with the goal of reducing overhead and complexity and creating a better client experience. This realignment was identified as a triggering event for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. As a result, interim goodwill impairment tests were performed during the first quarter of 2024 reflecting the reporting units both immediately before and immediately after the realignment, neither of which resulted in impairment. Additionally, goodwill was reallocated from our Commercial Bank reporting unit to our Institutional Bank reporting unit related to the realignment based on the relative fair value of the transferred business. The results of the impairment test reflecting the realignment indicated the fair value of each of the three reporting units, Consumer, Commercial, and Institutional, exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 10 . Additionally, we monitored events and circumstances through September 30, 2024, including macroeconomic factors, industry and banking sector events, Key specific performance indicators, and the sensitivity of the interim quantitative test results to changes in assumptions through September 30, 2024. At the conclusion of this assessment of all reporting units, we determined that as of September 30, 2024, it was more likely than not that the fair value of all reporting units exceeded the respective carrying value of such reporting units. 
 
 Refer to Key s 2023 Form 10-K for more information on valuation methodologies utilized for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Note 10 Goodwill of this report for additional information on the realignment and reallocated goodwill amounts.

 As described in Note 1 ("Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"), under the heading Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses beginning on page 109 of our 2023 Form 10-K, we estimate the ALLL using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current economic and portfolio conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In our estimation of expected credit losses, we use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products. Following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated, for all modeled loan portfolios, we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables (model inputs) to their long run average. We revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios. A 20-year fixed length look back period is used to calculate the long run average of the macroeconomic variables. A four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period. 
 
 We develop our reasonable and supportable forecasts using relevant data including, but not limited to, changes in economic output, unemployment rates, property values, and other factors associated with the credit losses on financial assets. Some macroeconomic variables apply to all portfolio segments, while others are more portfolio specific.

Table of contents 

In addition to macroeconomic drivers, portfolio attributes such as remaining term, outstanding balance, risk ratings, utilization, FICO, LTV, and delinquency also drive ALLL changes. Our ALLL models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes. As such, evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance. 
 
 Economic Outlook 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the unemployment rate remained at a relatively low level, although job growth has moderated. Inflation has eased, largely due to restrictive monetary policy and a higher interest rate environment. Commercial real estate values continue to be under pressure, with the office class showing the most vulnerability. Economic uncertainty remains elevated, primarily due to geopolitical tensions and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming U.S. presidential election. We used the Moody s August 2024 Consensus forecast as the baseline forecast to estimate expected credit losses as of September 30, 2024. We determined this forecast to be a reasonable view of the economic outlook, based on all available information at quarter end. 
 
 The baseline scenario reflects continued economic resiliency, but slower growth for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025 as higher rates continue to take their toll. U.S. GDP is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 2.6 and 1.8 for 2024 and 2025, respectively, compared to 2.5 in 2023. The National Unemployment Rate was 4.2 in the third quarter of 2024, will remain steady into late-2025 according to the forecast. The forecast also assumes the Federal Funds rate begins to ease in the third quarter 2024, while the U.S. Consumer Price Index is forecasted at 3.0 for all of 2024. The outlook for the National Home Price Index has improved, now reflecting 3.3 growth through 2024, while the Commercial Real Estate Price Index is forecasted to drop 4 by the end of 2024. 
 
 To the extent we identified credit risk considerations that were not captured by the third-party economic forecast, we addressed the risk through management s qualitative adjustments to the ALLL. As a result of the current economic uncertainty, our future loss estimates may vary considerably from our September 30, 2024 assumptions. 
 
 Commercial Loan Portfolio 
 
 The ALLL from continuing operations for the commercial segment decreased by million, or , from June 30, 2024. The overall decrease in the commercial allowance was driven by changes in portfolio activity, including the effects of continuing balance sheet optimization efforts, partly offset by economic changes. 
 
 The reserve decrease reflects strategic and ongoing loan attrition mostly within the C I portfolio. The reserve decrease is offset by credit portfolio migration as well as impacts from the extended period of higher interest rates and the current inflationary environment. 
 
 Consumer Loan Portfolio 
 
 The ALLL from continuing operations for the consumer segment decreased by million, or , from June 30, 2024 . The overall decrease in the consumer allowance was driven by the impact of balance sheet optimization efforts, partly offset by credit quality normalization post-pandemic.

 Loan Modifications Made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 
 The ALLL for loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is determined based on Key s ALLL policy as described within Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Modifications for Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 
 Our strategy in working with commercial borrowers is to allow them time to improve their financial position through loan modification. Commercial borrowers that are rated substandard or worse in accordance with the regulatory definition, or that cannot otherwise restructure at market terms and conditions, are considered to be experiencing financial difficulty. A modification of a loan is subject to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions, both new and existing. The modified loan is evaluated to determine if it is a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan. 
 
 Consumer loans in which a borrower requires a modification as a result of negative changes to their financial condition or to avoid default, generally indicate the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The primary modifications made to consumer loans are amortization, maturity date and interest rate changes. Consumer borrowers identified as experiencing financial difficulty are generally unable to refinance their loans through our normal origination channel or through other independent sources. 
 
 loans totaling million in a trial modification period. As of September 30, 2023, there were loans totaling million in a trial modification period. 
 
 Commitments outstanding to lend additional funds to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans were modified were million and million at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

An investment in any one of these funds typically can be sold only with the approval of the fund s general partners. At September 30, 2024, no significant liquidation of the underlying investments has been communicated to Key. The purpose of funding our capital commitments to these investments is to allow the funds to make additional follow-on investments and pay fund expenses until the fund dissolves.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to fair value generally result from the application of accounting guidance that requires assets and liabilities to be recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, or assessed for impairment. For more information on the valuation techniques used to measure classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements in our 2023 Form 10-K. There were liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Accrued income and other assets Total assets on a nonrecurring basis at fair value 
 
 We have other investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values and do not qualify for the practical expedient to measure the investment using a net asset value per share. We have elected to measure these securities at cost less impairment plus or minus adjustments due to observable orderly transactions. Impairment is recorded when there is evidence that the expected fair value of the investment has declined to below the recorded cost. At each reporting period, we assess if these investments continue to qualify for this measurement alternative. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of equity investments under this method was million and million, respectively. adjustments or impairments were recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Based on our evaluation at September 30, 2024, an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded nor have unrealized losses been recognized into income. The issuers of the securities are of high credit quality and have a history of no credit losses, management does not intend to sell, and it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely attributed to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments.

 (a) We take into account bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts held with a single counterparty on a net basis, and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral when recognizing derivative assets and liabilities. As a result, we could have derivative contracts with negative fair values included in derivative assets and contracts with positive fair values included in derivative liabilities. 
 (b) Other derivatives include interest rate lock commitments related to our residential and commercial banking activities, forward sale commitments related to our residential mortgage banking activities, forward purchase and sales contracts consisting of contractual commitments associated with to be announced securities and when-issued securities, and other customized derivative contracts. 
 (c) Netting adjustments represent the amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. As of September 30, 2024, excess collateral that has not been offset against net derivative instrument positions totaled million of cash collateral and million of securities collateral posted as well as million of cash collateral and million of securities collateral held. As of December 31, 2023, excess collateral that has not been offset against net derivative instrument positions totaled million of cash collateral and million of securities collateral posted as well as million of cash collateral and million of securities collateral held. 
 (d) Other collateral represents the amount that cannot be used to offset our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The other collateral consists of securities and is exchanged under bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to offset the net derivative position with the related collateral. The application of the other collateral cannot reduce the net derivative position below zero. Therefore, excess other collateral, if any, is not reflected above.

 (c) Certain amounts are designed as fair value hedges under the portfolio layer method. The carrying amount represents the amortized costs basis of the prepayable financial assets used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is the l ast layer expected to be remaining at the end of the relationship. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the amortized costs of the closed portfolios in these hedging relationships was billion and billion, respectively, of which billion were designated in a portfolio layer hedging relationship for both period ends. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the cumulative basis adjustments associated with these amounts totaled million and million, respectively. 
 
 Cash flow hedges. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we did not exclude any portion of cash flow hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
 
 Considering the interest rates, yield curves, and notional amounts as of September 30, 2024, we expect to reclassify an estimated million of after-tax net losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges from AOCI to income during the next 12 months. In addition, we expect to reclassify approximately million of net losses related to terminated cash flow hedges from AOCI to income during the next 12 months. These reclassified amounts could differ from actual amounts recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations and the addition of other hedges subsequent to September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum length of time over which we hedge forecasted transactions is years.

 We enter into derivative transactions with primary groups: broker-dealers and banks, and clients. Given that these groups have different economic characteristics, we have different methods for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk. 
 
 We enter into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for various risk management purposes. These types of 
 transactions are primarily high dollar volume. We enter into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with 
 these counterparties. We clear certain types of derivative transactions with these counterparties, whereby central 
 clearing organizations become the counterparties to our derivative contracts. In addition, we enter into derivative 
 contracts through swa p execution facilities. Swap clearing and swap execution facilities reduce our exposure to 
 counterparty credit risk. At September 30, 2024, we had gross exposure of million to broker-dealers and banks. We had net exposure of million after the application of master netting agreements and cash collateral, where such qualifying agreements exist. We held no additional collateral in the form of securities against this net exposure. 
 
 We enter into transactions using master netting agreements with clients to accommodate their business needs. In 
 most cases, we mitigate our credit exposure by cross-collateralizing these transactions to the underlying loan collateral. We mitigate our market risk by buying and selling U.S. Treasuries and SOFR futures or entering into offsetting positions. Due to the cross-collateralization to the underlying loan, we typically do not exchange cash or marketable securities collateral in connection with these transactions. To address the risk of default associated with these contracts, we have established a CVA reserve (included in accrued income and other assets in the amount of million at September 30, 2024. The CVA is calculated from potential future exposures, expected recovery rates, and market-implied probabilities of default. At September 30, 2024, we had gross exposure of million to client counterparties and other entities that are not broker-dealers or banks for derivatives that have associated master netting agreements. We had net exposure of million o n our derivatives with these counterparties after the application of master netting agreements, collateral, an d the related reserve. 
 
 Credit Derivatives 
 
 We are a buyer and, under limited circumstances, may be a seller of credit protection through the credit derivative market. We purchase credit derivatives to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending and swap obligations as well as exposures to debt securities. Our credit derivative portfolio was in a net liability position o f million a s of September 30, 2024, and million as of December 31, 2023. Our credit derivative portfolio consists of traded credit default swap indices and risk participation agreements. Additional descriptions of our credit derivatives are provided in Note 8 Derivatives and Hedging Activities beginning on page 142 of our 2023 Form 10-K under the heading Credit Derivatives.

 Credit Risk Contingent Features 
 
 We have entered into certain derivative contracts that require us to post collateral to the counterparties when these contracts are in a net liability position. The amount of collateral to be posted is based on the amount of the net liability and thresholds generally related to our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings with Moody s and S P. Collateral requirements also are based on minimum transfer amounts, which are specific to each Credit Support Annex (a component of the ISDA Master Agreement) that we have signed with the counterparties. In a limited number of instances, counterparties have the right to terminate their ISDA Master Agreements with us if our ratings fall below a certain lev el, usually investment-grade level (i.e., Baa3 for Moody s and BBB- for S P). At September 30, 2024, KeyBank s rating was Baa1 with Moody s and BBB+ with S P, and KeyCorp s rating was Baa2 with Moody s and BBB with S P. ) Collateral posted

 The fair value of commercial mortgage servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows associated with servicing the loans. This calculation uses a number of assumptions that are based on current market conditions.

Residual cash flows discount rate Escrow earn rate Loan assumption rate 
 
 If these economic assumptions change or prove incorrect, the fair value of commercial mortgage servicing assets may also change. Expected credit losses, escrow earning rates, and discount rates are critical to the valuation of commercial mortgage servicing assets. Estimates of these assumptions are based on how a market participant would view the respective rates, and reflect historical data associated with the commercial mortgage loans, industry trends, and other considerations. Actual rates may differ from those estimated due to changes in a variety of economic factors. A decrease in the value assigned to the escrow earning rates would cause a decrease in the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. An increase in the assumed default rates of commercial mortgage loans or an increase in the assigned discount rates would cause a decrease in the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. Prepayment activity on commercial serviced loans does not significantly affect the valuation of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. Unlike residential mortgages, commercial mortgages experience significantly lower prepayments due to certain contractual restrictions affecting the borrower s ability to prepay the mortgage. 
 
 The amortization of commercial servicing assets is determined in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated net servicing income. The amortization of commercial servicing assets for each period, as shown in the table at the beginning of this note, is recorded as a reduction to contractual fee income. The contractual fee income from servicing commercial mortgage loans totaled million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, and million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This fee income was offset by million of amortization for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, and million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Both the contractual fee income and the amortization are recorded, net, in commercial mortgage servicing fees on the income statement.

 We monitored events and circumstances through September 30, 2024, including macroeconomic factors, industry and banking sector events, Key specific performance indicators, and the sensitivity of the interim quantitative test results to changes in assumptions through September 30, 2024. At the conclusion of this assessment of all reporting units, we determined that as of September 30, 2024, it was more likely than not that the fair value of all reporting units exceeded the respective carrying value of such reporting units. 
 
 The reporting units at which goodwill is tested for impairment are the Consumer Bank, Commercial Bank and Institutional Bank reporting units. As the Commercial Bank and Institutional Bank reporting units are aggregated within Key s overall Commercial Bank reporting segment, the realignment of real estate capital did not have an impact on our reportable segments, however, goodwill was reallocated from the Commercial Bank reporting unit to the Institutional Bank reporting unit. During the first quarter of 2024, the Commercial Bank and Institutional Bank reporting units were allocated goodwill of million and million, respectively. There were no changes to goodwill balances in the third quarter of 2024.

These investments are recorded in accrued income and other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any loss reserves recorded related to these investments because we believe the likelihood of any loss to be remote. For all legally binding, unfunded equity commitments, we increase our recognized investment and recognize a liability. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had liabilities of billion and billion, respectively, related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects, which are recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

These investments are recorded in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 December 31, 2023 Indirect investments 
 
 Through our principal investing entities, we have formed and funded operating entities that provide management and other related services to our investment company funds, which directly invest in portfolio companies. These entities had assets at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, that can be used to settle the entities obligations. The entities had liabilities at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, and other equity investors have no recourse to our general credit.

 Other unconsolidated VIEs. We are involved with other various entities in the normal course of business which we have determined to be VIEs. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance or hold a variable interest that could potentially be significant. The table below shows our assets and liabilities associated with these unconsolidated VIEs at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. These assets are recorded in accrued income and other assets, other investments, securities available for sale, held-to-maturity securities, and loans, net of unearned income on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Deferred Taxes 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had a net deferred tax asset of billion, compared to a net deferred tax asset of billion at December 31, 2023, which are included in accrued income and other assets on the balance sheet. The deferred tax asset is primarily related to market fluctuations in the investment security portfolio accounted for in other comprehensive income. 
 
 To determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, and therefore recorded, we conduct a quarterly assessment of all available evidence. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, taxable income in prior periods, projected future taxable income, and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. These assessments involve a degree of subjectivity and may undergo change. Based on these criteria, we had a valuation allowance of million at September 30, 2024, and million at December 31, 2023. The valuation allowance is associated with federal and state capital loss carryforwards. 
 
 Unrecognized Tax Benefits 
 
 At September 30, 2024, Key s unrecognized tax benefits were million. As permitted under the applicable accounting guidance for income taxes, it is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. 
 
 Pre-1988 Bank Reserves Acquired in a Business Combination 
 
 Retained earnings of KeyBank included approximately million of allocated bad debt deductions for which no income taxes have been recorded. Under current federal law, these reserves are subject to recapture into taxable income if KeyBank, or any successor, fails to maintain its bank status under the Internal Revenue Code or makes non-dividend distributions or distributions greater than its accumulated earnings and profits. No deferred tax liability has been established as these events are not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.

Assets pledged as collateral are reported in securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At September 30, 2024, the liabilities associated with collateral pledged were solely comprised of customer sweep financing activity and had a carrying value of million. The collateral pledged under customer sweep repurchase agreements is posted to a third-party custodian and cannot be sold or repledged by the secured party. The risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral pledged is minimal given the collateral's high credit quality and the overnight duration of the repurchase agreements.

 (a) The maximum potential undiscounted future payments represent notional amounts of derivatives qualifying as guarantees. 
 
 We determine the payment/performance risk associated with each type of guarantee described below based on the probability that we could be required to make the maximum potential undiscounted future payments shown in the preceding table. We use a scale of low to probability of payment), moderate (greater than to probability of payment), or high (greater than probability of payment) to assess the payment/performance risk, and have determined that the payment/performance risk associated with each type of guarantee outstanding at September 30, 2024, is low. Information pertaining to the nature of each of the guarantees listed below is included in Note 22 Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees under the heading Guarantees beginning on page 172 of our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Recourse agreement with FNMA. At September 30, 2024, the outstanding commercial mortgage loans in this program had a weighted-average remaining term of years, and the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold by us as a participant was billion. The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that we could be required to make under this program, as shown in the preceding table, is equal to approximately of the principal balance of loans outstanding at September 30, 2024. FNMA delegates responsibility for originating, underwriting, and servicing mortgages, and we assume a limited portion of the risk of loss during the remaining term on each commercial mortgage loan that we sell to FNMA. We maintain a reserve for such potential losses of million that we believe approximates the fair value of our liability for the guarantee as described in Note 4 Asset Quality ). 
 
 Residential Mortgage Banking. At September 30, 2024, the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold by us in this program was billion. The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that we could be required to make under this program, as shown in the preceding table, is equal to approximately of the principal balance of loans outstanding at September 30, 2024.

 Written put options. In the ordinary course of business, we write put options for clients that wish to mitigate their exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices. At September 30, 2024, our written put options had an average life of years. These written put options are accounted for as derivatives at fair value, as further discussed in Note 7 Derivatives and Hedging Activities ). 
 
 Written put options where the counterparty is a broker-dealer or bank are accounted for as derivatives at fair value but are not considered guarantees since these counterparties typically do not hold the underlying instruments. In addition, we are a purchaser and seller of credit derivatives, which are further discussed in Note 7 Derivatives and Hedging Activities ). 
 
 Other Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
 
 Other off-balance sheet risk stems from financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee as specified in the applicable accounting guidance, and from other relationships.

 Consistent with our capital plan, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of per Common Share for the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Scotiabank Investment 
 
 On August 12, 2024, we entered into an Investment Agreement with Scotiabank pursuant to which Scotiabank agreed to make a strategic minority investment in KeyCorp of approximately billion, representing approximately pro forma common stock ownership of KeyCorp, for a fixed price of per share. On August 30, 2024, Scotiabank completed the initial purchase of of KeyCorp s Common Shares with an investment of approximately million in gross proceeds. With this investment, Scotiabank owns approximately of KeyCorp s Common Shares. The parties expect to complete the final purchase of approximately billion of KeyCorp s Common Shares in the first quarter of 2025, subject to Federal Reserve approval. The exact number of shares to be issued in connection with the final purchase is dependent on the total shares outstanding at the time of final purchase which precludes equity classification of the Investment Agreement. As such the Investment Agreement is accounted for as a financial instrument at fair value with changes recorded through earnings. As of September 30, 2024, the value of the financial instrument did not have a material impact to our results of operations or financial condition.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of KeyCorp 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of KeyCorp as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated interim financial statements ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of KeyCorp as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 22, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of KeyCorp's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to KeyCorp in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 
 
 The information presented in the Market risk management section of the Management s Discussion Analysis of Financial Condition Results of Operations is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )), to ensure that information required to be disclosed by KeyCorp in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to KeyCorp s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report. No changes were made to KeyCorp s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the last quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, KeyCorp s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 The information presented in the Legal Proceedings section of Note 17 Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 On at least a quarterly basis, we assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. Where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, we have not accrued legal reserves, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. Based on information currently available to us, advice of counsel, and available insurance coverage, we believe that our established reserves are adequate and the liabilities arising from the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 For a discussion of certain risk factors affecting us, see the section titled Supervision and Regulation in Part I, Item 1. Business, on pages 11-24 of our 2023 Form 10-K; Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, on pages 25-41 of our 2023 Form 10-K; the sections titled Supervision and regulation and Strategic developments in this report; and our disclosure regarding forward-looking statements in this report. The additional risk factor set forth below represents a new risk that has become applicable since the filing of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Following the final purchase under the Investment Agreement, Scotiabank will hold a significant equity interest in our business and may exercise influence over us, including through its ability to designate up to two directors to KeyCorp s Board of Directors. In addition, the Investment Agreement is accounted for as a financial instrument at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through earnings, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 

In August 2024, KeyCorp entered into an Investment Agreement with Scotiabank, pursuant to which Scotiabank agreed to purchase, in two closings, such number of KeyCorp s Common Shares that, taken together with all other Common Shares then owned by Scotiabank and its affiliates, would represent approximately 14.9 of the issued 
 96 

Table of contents 

and outstanding Common Shares of KeyCorp on a post-transaction basis. The first closing occurred in August 2024 and Scotiabank currently holds approximately 4.9 of KeyCorp s outstanding Common Shares. We cannot provide any assurance that the second closing under the Investment Agreement will occur in a timely manner, or at all. Following the second closing, Scotiabank is expected to hold approximately 14.9 of KeyCorp s issued and outstanding Common Shares. In addition, under the Investment Agreement, following the second closing, Scotiabank will be entitled to designate up to two directors to KeyCorp s Board of Directors, subject to specified minimum ownership requirements. As a result of the amount of Common Shares that will be held by Scotiabank, together with its director designation rights, Scotiabank may be able to influence our policies and operations and impact matters requiring shareholder approval. In addition, the existence of a large shareholder may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company. The interests of Scotiabank with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and our other shareholders, such as future acquisitions, financings, and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. 
 
 In addition, because the exact number of shares to be issued by us to Scotiabank at the second closing is dependent on the total shares outstanding at the time of final purchase, equity classification of the Investment Agreement is precluded and, therefore, the Investment Agreement is accounted for as a financial instrument at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through earnings. As of September 30, 2024, the value of the financial instrument did not have a material impact to our results of operations or financial condition. As a result of the potential future volatility in the market price of our Common Shares used in the fair value estimation of the financial instrument, our financial statements and results of operations may fluctuate in future periods, based on various factors, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we may recognize non-cash gains or losses on the financial instrument for each reporting period and the amount of such gains or losses could be material. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 From time to time, KeyCorp or its principal subsidiary, KeyBank, may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange outstanding debt of KeyCorp or KeyBank, and capital securities or preferred stock of KeyCorp, through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 
 We did not complete any open market share repurchases in the third quarter of 2024, and have no Board-approved repurchase authorizations outstanding. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, Key repurchased less than 1 million of shares related to equity compensation programs. 
 
 On August 30, 2024, KeyCorp issued 47,829,359 Common Shares for approximately 821 million in gross proceeds to Scotiabank pursuant to the first closing under the Investment Agreement, which was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by virtue of the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
 
 The following table summarizes our repurchases of our Common Shares for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 19 Shareholders' Equity for more information regarding share repurchases made during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.
