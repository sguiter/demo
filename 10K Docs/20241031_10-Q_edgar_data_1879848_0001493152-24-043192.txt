of the membership interests of PCL and

On
September 26, 2023, the Group s ultimate parent company, SPI s wholly - owned subsidiary,
EdisonFuture, Inc., sold shares of the Company s common stock owned by it, representing of the outstanding shares of the
Company, to Palo Alto Clean Tech Holding Limited Palo Alto ), an entity owned and controlled by Mr. Xiaofeng Peng, the
Company s Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO. After this transaction, SPI was no longer the Group s ultimate parent
company but still considered as a related party of the Group as SPI owns over of the Company s outstanding shares through EdisonFuture,
Inc, and it is an affiliated company controlled by Mr. Xiaofeng Peng. 

In
November 2023, the Group participated in two of court auctions and emerged as the highest bidder for two asset packages, one for Proterra
transit business unit and one for the Proterra battery lease contracts, with total consideration of in cash. As part of the acquisition,
the Group assumed estimated warranty liability of . On January 11, 2024, the Group completed the acquisition of the Proterra transit
business unit and on February 7, 2024, the Group completed the acquisition of Proterra battery lease contracts. After the acquisition,
the Group engages in the business that designs, develops and sells electric transit buses as an original equipment manufacturer for North
American public transit agencies, airports, universities and other commercial transit fleets and the Group was assigned with the right
to collect certain leasing receivables which Proterra was a party as the lessor thereunder, used in connection with deployed Proterra
electric transit buses. In March 2024, the Group declared its plan to sell all the Battery Lease Agreements acquired from Proterra acquisition.
On June 24, 2024, the Group entered into an asset purchase agreement with Zenobe Americas EV Assotco LLC (Zenobe). In the agreement,
the Group sells the battery lease receivables to Zenobe in two batches while retains the warranty liability associated with leased batteries.

A
contract liability is the Group s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received
consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. The Group records contract liabilities as advance from
customers and deferred income. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balances of contract liabilities were 
and ,
respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Group recognized 
as revenue that was included in the balance of advance from customers at January 1, 2024. 

as of June 30, 2024, in which current portion of was included in prepaid expenses and other current
assets, net on the balance sheet. During the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, there was no gain or loss on sales-type leases.
During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, gain on sales-type leases was nil and , respectively. 

According
to Business Combination (Topic 805) the Group performs a screen test to evaluate whether a transaction should be accounted for as an
acquisition and/or disposal of a business versus assets. In order for a purchase to be considered an acquisition of a business, and receive
business combination accounting treatment, the set of transferred assets and activities must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive
process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross
assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, then the set of transferred
assets and activities is not a business. 

Warranty
expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The balance of warranty reserves
was and as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

based on the difference between fair value and the carrying amount of the reporting unit. 

during the six months ended June 30, 2024, mainly due to the bargain purchase gain from the acquisition of Proterra transit business
unit. Excluding the one-time bargain purchase gain, the Group incurred a net loss of during the six months ended June 30,
2024 and has incurred significant recurring losses before 2024. In addition, the cash flow used in operating activities was 
and the Group needs to raise additional funds to sustain its operations. Furthermore, the Group assumes the responsibility to
provide Proterra transit business unit employees job offers at closing date and keep those employees for at least one year, which
costs are estimated to be over .
These factors raise substantial doubt as to the Group s ability to continue as a going concern. 

For
the next 12 months from the issuance date of the condensed consolidated quarterly financial statements, the Group plans to continue pursuing
strategies to improve liquidity and raise additional funds while implementing various measures to control costs and improve efficiency.
Such strategies and measures include the following: 1) continue to drive for operation integration and efficiency under ONE Phoenix,
re-alignment operating units under ONE Goal, right sizing workforce under ONE Team; 2) re-establish the cost structure and cost base
to increase operation efficiency with the new integrated ERP and other operating systems; 3) expand and strengthen strategic partnership
to outsource a significant portion of design and engineering work for the next generation product to third party vendors and suppliers
to control overall development and supply chain costs; 4) implement working capital initiatives and negotiate better payment terms with
customers and for some of the new orders, require down payments; 5) implement cash saving initiatives and tighter cash control, and calibrate
capital allocation to manage liquidity; and 6) continue to proactively implement a robust capital market strategy to provide financing
for the Group s operations through proceeds from private stock offering, debt financings including but not limited to term loans,
revolving line of credit and equity linked instruments, and potentially federal and state incentive funding programs. 

There
is no assurance that the plans will be successfully implemented. If the Group fails to achieve these goals, the Group may need additional
financing to repay debt obligations and execute its business plan, and the Group may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital
on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that financing sources are not available, or that the Group is unsuccessful
in increasing its gross profit margin and reducing operating losses, the Group may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion,
repay debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on the Group s business,
financial condition and results of operations and may materially adversely affect its ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification
of recorded assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should the Group
be unable to continue as a going concern. 

in cash. The transaction costs were and the Group assumed estimated warranty liability of . In addition, the Group
also assumed the responsibility to provide Proterra transit business unit employees job offers at closing date and keep those employees
for at least one year. The cash consideration has been fully paid as of June 30, 2024. 

The
acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, the acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair
value at the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation was based on a valuation analysis that utilized and considered generally
accepted valuation methodologies such as the market and cost approach. The Group determines the fair value of the assets acquired and
the liabilities assumed in this business combination with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm. The determination and allocation
of fair values to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies
requiring considerable judgment from management. The amount of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration
transferred and the allocation of negative goodwill to reduce the tax bases of acquired net assets causes the book bases to exceed their
respective tax bases, resulting in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities. The Group measures the bargain purchase gain from Proterra
acquisition as follows: 

Right-of-use assets 

Property and equipment 

Battery lease receivable 

Lease liabilities 

Warranty liabilities 

Deferred tax liabilities 

Identifiable net assets acquired (a) 

Less: Fair value of the consideration transferred (b) 

Gain on bargain purchase (b-a) 

During
the six months ended June 30, 2024 measurement period since the acquisition date, the Group adjusted the fair value of the inventories
acquired for an amount of , with the offset recorded as a decrease to bargain purchase gain and decrease to deferred
tax liabilities. These adjustments were made as the Group obtained new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the
acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. 

The
gain on bargain purchase from the Proterra acquisition was generated from the acquisition of a bankrupt company and the Group was the
only bidder who would continue to run the transit business and keep all transit business employees for at least a one-year period. Other
bidders would liquidate the transit assets and terminate the transit business employees. The Group s bidding was accepted by the
Bankruptcy Court. 

Due
to the fact that the acquisition occurred in the current interim period, the Group s fair value estimates for the purchase price
allocation are preliminary and may change during the allowable measurement period, which is up to the point the Group obtains and analyzes
the information that existed as of the date of the acquisition necessary to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, but in no case to exceed more than one year from the date of acquisition. As of October 30, 2024, the Group had not finalized
the determination of fair values allocated to various assets and liabilities, including, but not limited to, property and equipment,
inventories, tax uncertainties and liabilities assumed. Any changes in the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
during the measurement period may result in material adjustments to gain on bargain purchase. 

The
pro forma information that presents the Group s pro forma results of operations assuming the acquisition of Proterra transit buses
and battery lease receivables took place on January 1, 2023 is not available due to the following reasons: (i) Proterra had three business
groups and the three Proterra business groups were integrated and worked together to fulfill customers orders, and Proterra does
not have standalone data for any of its three business groups, including employee data; and (ii) Proterra did not grant access to the
Group of Proterra s prior years consolidated financial data due to the integrated nature of this data. Furthermore, due
to significant personnel turnover in the accounting and finance departments of Proterra, the Group lacks the historical knowledge and
data to recreate the standalone financial statements for each business group for prior periods 

Net income 

(Note

In
March 2024, the Group has committed to a plan to sell the battery lease receivables and this group of asset to be sold is ready for sale
and can be clearly distinguished and valued at its reasonable current fair value. The transaction is probable to close in the second
half of 2024 and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made. Thus, the leased assets were recorded as assets held-for-sale
and recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. 

On
June 24, 2024, the Group entered into an asset purchase agreement with Zenobe. In the agreement, the Group sells the battery lease receivables
to Zenobe in two batches while retains the warranty liability associated with leased batteries. On July 5, 2024, the Group closed the first batch of the sale and received net proceeds
of from the sale. The Group is expected to close the second batch of the sale in 2024. 

The
Group recorded the carrying amount of lease receivable at as of June 30, 2024, which represents the best estimate of the current
fair value.

aggregate principal amount
of the Company s unsecured senior convertible promissory notes (the June 2023 Notes ). The June 2023 Notes
are subject to an original issue discount of , and each June 2023 Note matures on the date that is after the date of issuance
at each applicable closing. The June 2023 Notes accrue interest at the Prime Rate (as defined in the June 2023 Notes) plus per
annum in cash, or the Prime Rate plus per annum if interest is paid in shares of common stock. The Company may, from time to time,
prepay the principal amount owing under the June 2023 Notes, subject to a prepayment premium, so long as the Company provides at
least business days prior written notice to the holder of such prepayment. 

The
June 2023 Notes are convertible into shares of common stock of the Company, at a conversion price equal to the greater of (x) (the
 Floor Price and (y) of the lowest daily VWAP (as defined in the SPA) in the seven trading days prior
to the applicable conversion date (the Variable Price ), subject to certain adjustments including full ratchet anti-dilution
price protection, as set forth in the June 2023 Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, automatically following an Event of Default (as
defined in the June 2023 Notes), without the requirement of the holder to provide notice to the Company, and subject to the provisions
relating to the stockholder approval requirements under Nasdaq rules for the issuance of shares in a private placement at a price above
the market price (the Nasdaq 19.99 Cap ), the conversion price is equal to the lesser of the (x) Floor Price and (y) the
Variable Price. In respect of any conversion where the Variable Price is less than the Floor Price (the Alternative Conversion ),
the Company will pay to the holder either in cash, or subject to the Nasdaq 19.99 Cap, in shares of common stock equal to such conversion
amount or interests, divided by the applicable Variable Price. So in essence, there is no floor price for the conversion and Alternative
Conversion together. 

Thus,
the Group determined that the conversion feature and the alternative conversion features embedded within the June 2023 Notes met the
definition of embedded derivatives and the Group estimated a fair value of the derivative liability using the Monte Carlo Simulation
Model at the date of issuance. As the fair value of the derivative liability is less than the face value of the June 2023 Notes, the
fair value of the derivative liability of was recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which
offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The original issue discount of the June 2023 Notes of was recorded as a debt discount as
well. 120 of the principal amount of the June 2023 Notes were converted during the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

On
October 26, 2023, the Company entered into the First Amendment (the Amendment to the Original SPA, with the same accredited

in a private placement, an additional of principal amount (the October 2023 Notes of the Company s unsecured
senior convertible promissory note. 

In
connection with the Amendment, the Company issued a warrant (the October Warrant to the investor to purchase up to 
shares of the Company s common stock, with an exercise price equal to per share, subject to full ratchet anti-dilution protection
and other adjustments as stated in the warrant, which warrant is exercisable for six years on a cash basis or, if the shares of common
stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant are not registered within 12 months after the closing, on a cashless basis. The Group determined
that the October Warrant met the definition of equity instrument and estimated a fair value of the October Warrant using the Black Scholes
pricing model at the date of issuance. 

The
October 2023 Notes are convertible into shares of common stock of the Company, at a conversion price equal to the greater of (x) 
(the Fixed Price and (y) of the lowest daily VWAP (as defined in the SPA) in the seven trading days prior to
the applicable conversion date (the Variable Price ), subject to certain adjustments including full ratchet anti-dilution
price protection, as set forth in the October 2023 Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, automatically following an Event of Default
(as defined in the October 2023 Notes), without the requirement of the holder to provide notice to the Company, and subject to the provisions
relating to the Nasdaq 19.99 Cap, the conversion price is equal to the lesser of the (x) Fixed Price and (y) the Variable Price. In
respect of any conversion where the Variable Price is less than the Fixed Price (the Alternative Conversion ), the Company
will pay to the holder either in cash, or subject to the Nasdaq 19.99 Cap, in shares of common stock equal to such conversion amount
or interests, divided by the applicable Variable Price. So in essence, there is no floor price for the conversion and Alternative Conversion
together. 

The
Group determined that the conversion feature and alternate conversion feature within the October 2023 Notes met the definition of embedded
derivatives and the Group estimated a fair value of the derivative liability using the Binominal Tree Model at the date of issuance.
In addition, the Group considered that the October Warrants were issued in a bundled transaction with the October 2023 Notes, and the
proceeds received from the transaction should be allocated based on the relative fair values of the base instrument and the warrants.
Accordingly, the Group recorded the relative fair value of the October Warrant of , the fair value of derivative liability of 
and the original issue discount and related issuance fee of the October 2023 Notes of as debt discounts, which offset the carrying
amount of the October 2023 Notes. of the principal amount of the October 2023 Notes were converted during the six months ended June
30, 2024.

investor, which the Company agreed to issue and sell, in a private placement, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions,

conditions have not been met and Company has not issued any convertible notes pursuant to the Second SPA. Upon execution of the Second
SPA, the Company also issued a warrant (the Execution Warrant to the investor to purchase up to shares of the
Company s common stock, with an exercise price equal to per share, subject to full ratchet anti-dilution protection and other
adjustments as stated in the warrant, which warrant is exercisable for six years on a cash basis or, if the shares of common stock issuable
upon exercise of the warrant are not registered within 12 months after the closing, on a cashless basis. Although the Second SPA has
not been closed yet, the Execution Warrant was issued during the year ended December 31, 2023, and the Execution Warrants can be exercisable
no matter whether the Second SPA would be closed or not in the future. 

The
Group determined that the Execution Warrant met the definition of equity instrument, and the Group estimated a fair value of Execution
Warrant using the Black Scholes pricing model at the date of issuance. The Group considered that the Execution Warrant was issued in
a bundled transaction with a future convertible note offering, and the Execution Warrant was considered as issuance costs associated
with the future convertible note offering and should be deferred and charged against the gross proceeds of the future offering as debt
discount based on the relative fair values of the base instrument and the warrants. However, this future convertible note offering (Second
SPA) is to be closed subject to certain closing conditions. The Group considered that it is less likely that the closing conditions could
be achieved in the future and recorded the deferred costs as expenses during the year ended December 31, 2023. On April 5, 2024, the
Group entered into a waiver letter by and between the Company and the above investor to which the investor waived its right to require
the Company to sell principal amount of the Company s secured senior convertible promissory note as previously agreed under
Second SPA. 

. In addition, the Group is obligated to pay to the holder of the June 2023 Note and October

occurred and that the notes are due and payable. As a result of the default, the carrying amount of both June 2023 Note and October 2023
Note were classified as convertible notes, current and all the remaining unamortized debt discounts were amortized into interest expense
immediately.

shares of common stock of the Company to the investor to convert a total principal amount of 
under the June 2023 Notes and 
under the October 2023 Notes, respectively, and accrued interest of

under the October 2023 Notes, respectively. The total fair value of the common stock issued for conversion was .
As a result of the conversion, the Group reclassified 
derivative liability into equity upon each conversion of the corresponding convertible notes. 

The
Group recorded interest expenses from debt discount amortization in interest expense, net in the statements of operations of and
 nil for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Among which, of the debt discount were amortized directly

Overview 

Phoenix
Motor Inc., doing business as Phoenix Motorcars through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Phoenix Cars LLC (PCL), Phoenix
Motorcars Leasing LLC (PML), and EdisonFuture Motor, Inc. (EdisonFuture), currently designs, assembles, and integrates electric drive
systems and light and medium duty electric vehicles EVs and transit buses and markets and sells electric vehicle chargers
for the commercial and residential markets. PCL also sells a range of material handling products including all-electric lithium-ion forklifts
and pallet jacks. 

The
Group operates two primary brands: Phoenix Motorcars, which is focused on commercial products, including medium duty electric
vehicles, chargers and electric forklifts; and EdisonFuture, which intends to offer light-duty electric vehicles. As an
EV pioneer, we delivered our first commercial EV in 2014. We develop and integrate our proprietary electric drivetrain into the Ford
Econoline Chassis (E-Series), specifically on the Ford E-450. The Ford E-Series is the dominant chassis in the medium duty Class 4 market
in the U.S. in terms of market share and the range of configurations varying from shuttle buses, Type A school buses, utility trucks,
service trucks, flatbed trucks, walk-in vans, and cargo trucks. Since our inception, we have been developing light and medium duty commercial
electric vehicles for various service and government fleet markets, including city fleets, campuses, municipalities, and transit agencies
and serve a broad spectrum of commercial fleet customers, such as airport shuttle operators, hotel chains, transit fleet operators, seaports,
last-mile delivery fleets, and large corporations. 

On
January 11, 2024, the Group completed the acquisition of the Proterra Transit Business Unit for a purchase price of 3.5 million.
The Group also assumed warranty obligations associated with the purchased Proterra Transit Business Unit. After the acquisition, the
Group engages in the business that designs, develops and sells electric transit buses as an original equipment manufacturer for North
American public transit agencies, airports, universities and other commercial transit fleets. On February 7, 2024, the Group completed
the acquisition of the Proterra Battery Lease Agreements for a purchase price of 6.5 million, by which the Group was assigned with the right
to collect certain leasing receivables which Proterra was a party as the lessor thereunder, used in connection with deployed Proterra
electric transit buses. The Group also assumed warranty obligations associated with the purchased Proterra Battery Lease Agreements.
In March 2024, the Group declared its plan to sell all the Battery Lease Agreements acquired from Proterra acquisition. On June 24, 2024,
the Group entered into an asset purchase agreement with Zenobe. In the agreement, the Group sells the battery lease receivables to Zenobe
in two batches while retains the warranty liability associated with leased batteries. The aggregate purchase price for Batch 1 transferred
assets is made of: (i) 3.6 million, minus (ii) any payments received by the Group from March 1, 2024 to the Batch 1 closing date, plus (iii)
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities incurred after the applicable Closing Date related to the Batch 1 Transferred Assets. The aggregate
purchase price for Batch 2 transferred assets is made of: (i) 2.2 million, minus (ii) any payments received by the Group from March 1, 2024
to the Batch 2 closing date, plus (iii) assumption of the Assumed Liabilities incurred after the applicable Closing Date related to the
Batch 2 Transferred Assets. On July 5, 2024, the Group closed the first batch of the sale and received net proceeds of 2.4 million from the
sale. The Group is expected to close the second batch of the sale in 2024.

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of our company, and all of our subsidiaries. We prepare
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the financial reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the
most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ
from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. In order to
understand the significant accounting policies that we adopted for the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements;
readers should refer to the information set forth in Note 3 Summary of significant accounting policies to our audited financial
statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024. 

Principal
Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 

We
believe that the following factors have had, and we expect that they will continue to have, a significant effect on the development of
our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

BOM
 and Supply Chain Challenges. Purchased materials represent the largest component of cost of goods sold in our products and
 we continue to explore ways to improve cost structure of our products through better design, strategic alliances for sourcing, supply
 chain optimization, and, in some cases vertical integration. We believe that an increase in volume and additional experience as well
 as long term and strengthened supply chain partnerships will allow us to continue to reduce our Bill of Materials BOM ),
 labor and overhead costs, as a percentage of total revenue. By reducing material costs, driving improvement in battery performance,
 increasing facility utilization rates and achieving better economies of scale, we can reduce prices while maintaining or growing
 gross margins of our products to further lower customers total cost of ownership TCO and help accelerate commercial
 electric vehicle adoption. Because we rely on third party suppliers for the development, manufacture, and development of many of
 the key components and materials used in our vehicles, we have been affected by industry-wide challenges such as significant delivery
 delays and supply shortages of certain BOM components. While we continue to focus on mitigating risks to our operations and supply
 chain in the current industry environment, we expect that these industry-wide trends will continue to affect our ability and the
 ability of our suppliers to obtain parts and components on a timely basis for the foreseeable future, having a significant impact
 on our business and results of operations in 2023 and possibly thereafter. 

A
 long sales and production cycle. We have a long sales and production cycle given our customers structured procurement
 processes and vehicle customization requirements. For out transit buses, public transit agencies typically conduct a request for
 proposal process before awards are made and purchase orders are issued. Proposals are evaluated on various criteria, including but
 not limited to technical requirements, reliability, reputation of the manufacturer, and price. This initial sales process from first
 engagement to award typically ranges from 6 to 18 months. Once a proposal has been awarded, a pre-production process is completed
 where customer specific options are mutually agreed upon. A final purchase order follows the pre-production process. Procurement
 of parts and production typically follow the purchase order. Once a bus is fully manufactured, the customer performs a final inspection
 before accepting delivery, allowing us to recognize revenue. The length of time between a customer award and vehicle acceptance typically
 varies between 12 and 24 months, depending on product availability and production capacity. 

Availability
 of Funding to Develop Products and Scale Production. Our results are impacted by our ability to sell our electrification
 solutions and services to new and existing customers. We have had initial success with selling to our fleet customers. In order to
 sell additional products to new and existing customers, we will require substantial additional capital to develop our products and
 services, ramp up production and support expansion. Although we pursue an asset light strategy, we expect that both our capital and
 operating expenditures will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we continue to invest in our technology,
 research and development efforts, obtain, maintain and improve our operational, financial and management information systems, hire
 additional personnel, obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio. Until we can generate sufficient
 revenue from vehicle sales, we expect to primarily finance our operations through proceeds from public or private stock offering,
 debt financings including but not limited to term loans, revolving line of credit and equity linked instruments, and potentially
 federal and state incentive funding programs. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements, will depend on many factors,
 including the pace and results of our research and development efforts , the lead time for various components in our supply chain,
 and our ability to successfully manage and control costs and scale our operations. 

4 

Ability
 to improve profit margins and scale our business . We intend to continue investing in initiatives to improve our operating
 leverage and significantly ramp production. We believe continued reduction in costs and an increase in production volumes will enable
 commercial vehicle manufacturers to electrify faster. Purchased materials represent the largest component of cost of goods sold in
 all products and we continue to explore ways to reduce these costs through improved design for cost, strategic sourcing and long-term
 contracts. We believe that an increase in volume and additional experience will allow us to leverage those investments and reduce
 our labor and overhead costs, as well as our freight costs, as a percentage of total revenue. As we grow into our current capacity,
 execute on cost-reduction initiatives, and improve production efficiency, we expect our product cost of goods sold as a percentage
 of revenue to decrease in the longer term. We anticipate that by increasing facility utilization rates and improving overall economies
 of scale, we can positively impact gross margins of our products, bring value to our customers and help accelerate commercial electric
 vehicle adoption. Our ability to achieve cost-saving and production-efficiency objectives can be negatively impacted by a variety
 of factors including, among other things, labor cost inflation, lower-than-expected facility utilization rates, rising real estate
 costs, manufacturing and production cost overruns, increased purchased material costs, and unexpected supply-chain quality issues
 or interruptions, and delays in our ability to hire, train, and retain employees needed to scale production to meet demand. 

Government
 Subsidies and Incentive Policies. With growing emphasis on improving air quality around our communities, large states like
 California are mandating key end user segments to switch to zero emission transportation options. Some of the key regulations driving
 growth in our addressable market include: 

requiring
 all transit buses in California to be zero emissions by 2040; 

requiring
 all airport shuttles in California to be all electric by 2035; and 

requiring
 at least 50 of all medium-duty trucks sold in California to electric by 2030, requiring specific end user segments like drayage
 and yard trucks to go electric. 

Other
states like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts are also expected to bring in regulatory requirements for key end user segments like,
transit agencies and school buses to switch to all electric transportation options. Fifteen other states including Connecticut, Colorado,
Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington
have committed to follow California s Advanced Clean Trucks Regulation. Primarily driven by the urgent need to meet carbon and
greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, various state and federal agencies are also supporting the switch to zero emission transportation,
providing a host of funding and incentive support to develop, demonstrate and deploy zero emission transportation solutions. Some of
the key funding / incentives driving adoption of electric medium duty vehicles include: 

the
 California Hybrid and Zero- Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project, which offers a minimum of 60,000 per vehicle as incentive
 for Class 4 electric vehicles registered and operating in the state; 

the
 New York Truck Voucher Incentive Program offering up to 100,000 per Class 4 electric vehicle; and 

funding
 from federal agencies like the Federal Transit Administration, covering up to 80 of the cost of procuring electric transit buses
 and various funding options covering up to 100 of the cost of procuring all electric school buses across key states. 

Federal
 and various state agencies have established incentives for setting up both public and private charging infrastructure. Notably, the
 California Energy Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission have approved funding up to 100 of the cost of setting
 up chargers and related infrastructure. Large utilities like Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas Electric and San Diego
 Gas Electric have Charge Ready programs that cover the entire cost of setting up charging infrastructure. Other
 states like New York, Chicago, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Ohio have also introduced programs to support fleets with their
 charging infrastructure requirements.

Net
Revenues 

For
the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, our revenues were 12.0 million and 1.2 million, respectively. Our total revenue increased
by 10.8 million, or 9 00 , primarily due to the acquisition of Proterra transit business unit. The transit business unit contributed
 11.7 million of revenue to the Group for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was partially offset by the decline in our
sales of EVs. We delivered 5 EVs during the three months ended June 30, 2023 while we delivered only 1 EV during the three months ended
June 30, 2024. Such decrease was mainly because we incurred cash shortage issues starting from late 2023 which caused us to suspend most
of the production of EVs since the last quarter of 2023 and also due to a shift in our operation focus to more on transit business. 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, our revenues were 21.5 million and 2.9 million, respectively. Our total revenue increased
by 18.6 million, or 6 41 , primarily due to the acquisition of Proterra transit business unit. The transit business unit contributed
 20.7 million of revenue to the Group for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was partially offset by the decline in our
sales of EVs. We delivered 9 EVs during the six months ended June 30, 2023 while we delivered only 2 EV during the six months ended June
30, 2024. Such decrease was mainly because we incurred cash shortage issues starting from late 2023 and also due to a shift in our operation
focus to more on transit business.

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues for transit buses sales and EV sales includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overheads, and shipping
and logistics costs. Cost of revenues for EV leasing primarily includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles over the lease term
and other leasing related charges including vehicle insurance and batteries service cost. Cost of other revenue includes direct parts,
material and labor costs, as well as shipping and delivery and other costs. 

For
the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, our costs of revenues were 10.2 million and 1.2 million, respectively. The increase
in costs of revenues was primarily due to the increase in costs of transit buses due to increase in transit bus sales. 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, our costs of revenues were 17.1 million and 2.8 million, respectively. The increase in
costs of revenues was primarily due to the increase in costs of transit buses due to increase in transit bus sales. 

Gross Margin 

Gross
profit is defined as revenues minus cost of revenues. Gross margin, stated as a percentage, is defined as gross profit divided by revenues. 

For
the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, our combined gross margin was 15.2 and (5.3) , respectively. The increase of gross margin
was primarily due to higher margins for both EV sales and transit buses sales. The Group received gain on bargain purchase of Proterra
transit business unit and was able to quickly sell the inventories acquired from the acquisition with relatively higher margin. The increase
in margin for EV sales was mainly because there was only one EV sold during the three months ended June 30, 2024 with a relatively high
selling price. 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, our combined gross margin was 20.2 and 3.8 , respectively. The increase of gross margin
was primarily due to higher margins for both EV sales and transit buses sales. The Group received gain on bargain purchase of Proterra
transit business unit and was able to quickly sell the inventories acquired from the acquisition with relatively higher margin. The increase
in margin for EV sales was mainly because there was only two EV sold during the six months ended June 30, 2024 with a relatively high
selling price. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses consist of selling, general, and administrative expenses as well as impairment on goodwill. 

Our
selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, research and development, professional service fees, rent
expense, and office supplies expenses. 

For
the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.9 million and 3.1 million, respectively.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was largely due to an increase in salary expenses as a result of acquisition
of Proterra transit business unit with increased heads-count. 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 17.6 million and 6.9 million, respectively.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was largely due to an increase in salary expenses as a result of acquisition
of Proterra transit business unit with increased heads-count. 

During
the six months ended June 30, 2024, we identified impairment indicator resulted from the Company s continuous decreasing
stock price since January 2024 and performed interim goodwill impairment testing. We recorded an impairment on goodwill of 4.3 million
based on the difference between fair value and the carrying amount of the reporting unit. 

Other
Income (expense), net 

Other
income (expense), net includes gain on bargain purchase, interest expense, gain on sales-type leases and other income. 

Our
other expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was 0.8 million, primarily due to an adjustment on gain on bargain purchase
of Proterra transit business unit of 0.8 million and interest expense of 0.6 million, from short-term loan and debt discount
amortization of convertible note , partially offset
by change in fair value of derivative liability of 0.6 million. 

Our
other income for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was 29.3 million, primarily due to gain on bargain purchase of Proterra transit
business unit of 32.1 million and gain of change in fair value of derivative liability of 0.6 million, partially offset by the interest
expense of 3.3 million resulted from short-term loan and debt discount amortization of convertible note. Our other income for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was 0.9 million, primarily
due to refund of employee retention credit ERC from the IRS. 

On
March 29, 2024, the Group noted that an event of default has occurred under the June 2023 Notes and October 2023 Notes, and the default
was not fully cured within five (5) business days of such failure. As a result, the interest rate of the June 2023 Notes and October
2023 Notes was automatically increased to 18 per annum, starting from the date of occurrence of the event of default. 

7 

Net Income (loss) 

As
a result of the above factors, the net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, was 2.3 million and 3.2 million, respectively. 

As
a result of the above factors, the net income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 12.5 million, and the net loss for the six
months ended June 30, 2023 was 6.0 million. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Products
Warranties on transit buses and batteries 

The
Group provides a limited warranty to customers on vehicles, battery systems and components. The limited warranty ranges from one to 12
years depending on the components. Pursuant to these warranties, the Group will repair, replace, or adjust the parts on the products
that are defective in factory supplied materials or workmanship. The Group records a warranty reserve for the products sold at the point
of revenue recognition, which includes the best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under the limited warranty.
These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These
estimates are inherently uncertain given the relatively short history of sales. Changes to the historical or projected warranty experience
may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within
the next 12 months is included within warranty reserve - short term liabilities while the remaining balance is included within warranty
reservice - long term liabilities on the balance sheets. 

Warranty
expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The balance of warranty reserves
was 14,698 and 289 as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

See
Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in our Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024 for a description of recently issued or adopted accounting
pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Accounting
Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted 

ASU
2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures updates required disclosures of significant reportable
segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of a segment s profit
or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how
the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate
resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2024, though early adoption is permitted. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods
presented in the financial statements. The ASU will result in additional segment information disclosures within the Group s
financial statements but is not expected to impact the Group s financial results or financial position. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, that addresses
requests for improved income tax disclosures from investors that use the financial statements to make capital allocation decisions. Public
entities must adopt the new guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments in this ASU must be applied on
a retrospective basis to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and early adoption is permitted. The ASU will result
in additional income tax disclosures within the Group s financial statements but is not expected to impact the Group s financial
results or financial position. 

The
Group does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on the consolidated financial position, statements of operations and cash flows. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
had net income of 12.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, mainly due to acquisition of Proterra transit business
unit. Excluding the one-time bargain purchase gain from acquisition of Proterra transit business unit, we incurred a net loss of
 19.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and has incurred significant recurring losses before 2024. In addition, the
cash flow used in operating activities was 1.6 million and we need to raise additional funds to sustain our operations.
Furthermore, we assume the responsibility to provide Proterra transit business unit employees job offers at closing date and keep
those employees for at least one year, which costs are estimated to be over 20.0 million. These factors raise substantial doubt as
to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

8 

We
plan to continue pursuing strategies to improve liquidity and raise additional funds while implementing various measures to cut costs.
Such strategies and measures include the following: 1) continue to drive for operation integration under ONE Phoenix, re-alignment operating
units under ONE Goal, right sizing workforce under ONE Team; 2) re-establish the cost structure and cost base with the new integrated
ERP and other operating systems; 3) expand and strengthen strategic partnership to outsource a significant portion of design and engineering
work for the next generation product to third party vendors and suppliers to control overall development and supply chain costs; 4) implement
working capital initiatives and negotiate better payment terms with customers and for some of the new orders, require down payments;
5) implement cash saving initiatives and tighter cash control, and calibrate capital allocation to manage liquidity; and 6) continue
to proactively implement a robust capital market strategy to provide financing for the Group s operations through proceeds from
public or private stock offering, debt financings including but not limited to term loans, revolving line of credit and equity linked
instruments, and potentially federal and state incentive funding programs. There is no assurance that the plans will be successfully
implemented. If we fail to achieve these goals, we may need additional financing to execute our business plan, and we may not be able
to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that financing sources are
not available, or that we are unsuccessful in increasing our gross profit margin and reducing operating losses, we may be unable to implement
our current plans for expansion, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations and may materially adversely affect our ability to continue as a going concern. Our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

A

As
of June 30, 2024, we had 1.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of liquidity were from equity financing (through
public or private offerings) as well as various types of debt financings. 

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 1.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily as a result of (i) a net income
of 12.5 million, adjusted by non-cash items of bargain purchase gain of 32.1 million from acquisition of Proterra, impairment loss
of goodwill of 4.3 million, depreciation and amortization of 0.8 million, amortization of debt discount of convertible notes of 1.5
million, deferred tax liability reversal of 3.0 million, loss on change in market value of derivative liability, an accrual on warranty
reserve of 0.6 million and amortization of right of use of assets of 0.5 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities including
(i) increase in accounts receivable of 3.2 million due to uncollected accounts receivable from sales of transit buses, (ii) decrease
in inventories of 12.9 million due to certain inventories purchase from Proterra have been sold; (iii) increase in accrued liabilities
of 0.5 million due to interest accrued for Nations Bus loans, (iv) increase in accounts payable of 1.1million mainly due to additional
inventories purchased for upcoming manufacturing of transit buses, (v) increase in income tax payable of 2.3 million due to taxable
bargain purchase gain from acquisition of Proterra and (vi) increase in advance from customers of 2.3 million due to collection of downpayments
from transit bus sales. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 1.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily as a result of (i) a net loss of
 6.0 million, adjusted by non-cash items of depreciation and amortization of 0.8 million and amortization of right of use of assets
of 0.5 million, partially offset by (ii) a decrease in inventories of 2 million, (iii) a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets
of 0.4 million, and (iv) an increase in account payable of 0.7 million. 

Investing Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 10.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily because of acquisition of Proterra
for a total consideration of 10 million and 0.8 million of loan lent to a related party. 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily as a result of purchase of property
and equipment. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash generated from financing activities was 10.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily as a result of (i) net proceeds
from private placements of 11.1 million, (ii) proceeds from borrowing of 2.4 million, and (iii) proceeds of borrowings from a related
party of 1.4 million. The increase was partially offset by repayment to borrowings of 2.0 million and repayment of borrowings to a
related party of 2.3 million. 

Net
cash generated from financing activities was 2.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily as a result of net proceeds
from tapping the SEPA and convertible notes. 

9 

Capital Expenditures 

We
incurred capital expenditures of 10.1 million and 0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Our capital
expenditures have historically been comprised of purchase of Proterra assets, equipment for our offices and production infrastructure.
Our capital expenditures may increase in the future as we continue to invest in production and technology infrastructure. 

Trend Information 

Our
operating results substantially depend on revenues derived from our sales and leasing of EVs. Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this
report, the following trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments, or events for 2023 are reasonably likely to have a material effect
on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported consolidated financial information
not necessarily to be indicative of future operating results or financial conditions: 

Inflation
 Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2023, or IRA, was signed into law on August 16, 2023. The 370 billion allocated to
 climate and clean energy investments dramatically expands tax credits and incentives to deploy more clean vehicles, including commercial
 vehicles, while supporting a domestic EV supply chain and charging infrastructure buildout. IRA transportation sector provisions
 will accelerate the shift to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by combining consumer and manufacturing policies. The IRA extends the
 existing tax credit for electric vehicles and establishes a new tax credit for used electric vehicles, as well as establishes a new
 tax credit for commercial ZEVs. Under the IRA, commercial ZEVs will be eligible for a federal tax credit of up to the lesser of 30 
 of the sales price or the incremental cost of a comparable ICE-engine vehicle, capped at 7,500 for vehicles under 14,000 pounds
 and 40,000 for all others. In addition, governmental entities may also be eligible to claim these credits. Vehicles final
 assembly must be in North America to be eligible for the federal tax credit, but commercial vehicles are exempt from the battery
 or mineral sourcing requirements that apply to consumer electric vehicles. The federal tax credit on charging equipment has been
 extended through 2032. For commercial uses, the tax credit is 6 with a maximum credit of 100,000 per unit. The equipment must be
 placed in a low-income community or non-urban area. The IRS has yet to release further guidance on specific aspects of the aforementioned
 credits. The announcement of the IRA and the delay in receiving IRS guidance as to the roll-out of the new tax credits has reduced
 the number of customer orders during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, as many existing or potential customers
 are waiting to place orders until they are certain of the amount of tax credits available per ZEV. In addition, many customers are
 evaluating the size and type of ZEV they intend to purchase because the amount of the tax credit depends on the weight of the vehicle,
 among other factors. Furthermore, other government programs, such as the FTA s Low- and No-Emission Vehicle Program or certain
 state programs, recently announced new funding and are in the process of making these funds available for eligible purchases. Until
 these processes are established, we believe customer orders may be delayed. 

Supply-chain
 challenges. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we started to experience chassis and raw material shortages from suppliers.
 The challenge continues with the current development of our new generation electric vehicles. We need to source new components from
 various vendors which lead to longer lead times. In addition, because of the generation advancement, large capital spending is necessary
 to fund the project. Lack of cash flow on hand will also trigger the supply-chain challenges. As a result of these challenges, we
 have engaged with vendors to negotiate better terms and lower down-payment alternatives. We contracted with new suppliers to optimize
 costs, minimize supply chain issues, and prepare for an increase in future production. However, adding new suppliers, especially
 for chassis, increases requirements for working capital and places us at the mercy of price volatility. We expect supply chain challenges
 will continue for the foreseeable future. 

Inflation
 and interest rates. We are experiencing cost increases due to inflation resulting from various supply chain disruptions and other
 disruptions caused by the general global economic conditions. The cost of raw materials, manufacturing equipment, labor and shipping
 and transportation has increased considerably. We expect higher than recent years levels of inflation to persist for the foreseeable
 future. If we are unable to fully offset higher costs through price increases or other measures, we could experience an adverse impact
 to our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Interest rates have also increased considerably.
 The increase in inflation and interest rates impacts the demand for our EVs, as customers may delay purchasing and/or have difficulty
 financing their purchases.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

On
March 6, 2024, our related party, SPI Energy Co., Ltd. SPI entered into a Deed of Settlement with its creditor, Streeterville
Capital, LLC Streeterville to settle the unpaid balances of certain convertible notes via installment payments as agreed
in the Deed of Settlement. As of part of this Deed of Settlement, the Company, as the guarantor, covenants to Streeterville to pay and
satisfy on demand all liabilities due from SPI to Streeterville with a total amount of approximately 15 million. On September 6, 2024,
the guarantee was released and cancelled. 

As
of June 30, 2024, we had no other off-balance sheet arrangements that are or have been reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures,
or capital resources that are material to investors. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our own shares
and classified as shareholder s equity, or that are not reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity
or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity,
market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. 

For
more information on our contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies, see Note 16 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not
applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter
ended June 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our
principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report,
our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial and accounting officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

In
connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified following material
weaknesses, in the design or operation of internal controls. 

(1) 
 Failure
 to maintain an effective control environment of internal control over financial reporting; 

(2) 
 Failure
 to develop an effective risk assessment process to identify and evaluate at a sufficient level of detail all relevant risks of material
 misstatement, including business, operational, and fraud risks; 

(3) 
 Ineffective
 monitoring activities to assess the operation of internal control over financial reporting; 

(4) 
 Lack
 of sufficient controls designed and implemented for financial information processing and reporting and lacked resources with requisite
 skills for the financial reporting under U.S. GAAP. 

(5) 
 Failure
 to establish adequate governance procedures, including proper authorization and communication between key executives and the Board,
 a well-defined approval process with sufficient documentation for significant transactions, and effective monitoring and control
 measures for key personnel transitions, such as the revocation of access for departed executives. 

We
intend to implement measures designed to improve the Company s internal control over financial reporting to address the underlying
causes of these material weaknesses, including (1) hiring more qualified staff and increasing resources with sufficient knowledge and
experience to strengthen financial reporting; (2) setting up a financial and system control framework to ensure proper segregation of
duty and review procedures, with formal documentation of polices and controls in place; (3) forming a task force to design and improve
processes and controls to monitor operations and record financial data; (4) devoting proper time by senior management to perform comprehensive
review of procedures to assess risks and enforce effective accountability; and (5) enhancing governance practices by implementing a formal
approval process for significant transactions, improving communication between key executives and the Board, establishing strict controls
for related party transactions, and improving access management for key personnel transitions. 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. While we cannot predict the occurrence
or outcome of these proceedings with certainty, we do not believe that an adverse result in any pending legal proceeding, individually
or in aggregate, would be material to our financial condition. 

For
more information on our legal proceedings, see Note 16 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Risk
factors that may affect our business and financial results are discussed within Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024, and our subsequent filings with the SEC.
In addition to the those in our prior filings, the following are more risk factors to consider: 

Holders
of our Notes are entitled to certain payments that may be paid in cash or in shares of our common stock depending on the circumstances.
If we make these payments in cash, we may be required to expend a substantial portion of our cash resources. If we make these payments
in common stock, it may result in substantial dilution to the holders of our common stock. 

On
June 23, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Original SPA with a certain accredited investor
named therein, to issue and sell, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, up to 5.1 million aggregate principal amount
of the Company s unsecured senior convertible promissory notes (the June 2023 Notes ). The June 2023 Notes are subject
to an original issue discount of 8.5 , and each June 2023 Note matures on the date that is 18 months after the date of issuance at each
applicable closing. The June 2023 Notes accrue interest at the Prime Rate (as defined in the June 2023 Notes) plus 4.75 per annum in
cash, or the Prime Rate plus 7.75 per annum if interest is paid in shares of common stock. The Company may, from time to time, prepay
the principal amount owing under the June 2023 Notes, subject to a 30 prepayment premium, so long as the Company provides at least 30
business days prior written notice to the holder of such prepayment. 

The
June 2023 Notes are convertible into shares of common stock of the Company, at a conversion price equal to the greater of (x) 0.60 (the
 Floor Price and (y) 87.5 of the lowest daily VWAP (as defined in the SPA) in the seven (7) trading days prior to the
applicable conversion date (the Variable Price ), subject to certain adjustments including full ratchet anti-dilution price
protection, as set forth in the June 2023 Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, automatically following an Event of Default (as defined
in the June 2023 Notes), without the requirement of the holder to provide notice to the Company, and subject to the provisions relating
to the stockholder approval requirements under Nasdaq rules for the issuance of shares in a private placement at a price above the market
price (the Nasdaq 19.99 Cap ), the conversion price is equal to the lesser of the (x) Floor Price and (y) the Variable
Price. In respect of any conversion where the Variable Price is less than the Floor Price (the Alternative Conversion ),
the Company will pay to the holder either in cash, or subject to the Nasdaq 19.99 Cap, in shares of common stock equal to such conversion
amount or interests, divided by the applicable Variable Price. So in essence, there is no floor price for the conversion and Alternative
Conversion together. 

On
October 26, 2023, the Company entered into that certain First Amendment (the Amendment to the Original SPA together with
the Amendment, the SPA ), with the same accredited investor. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Funding Amount 
under the Original SPA was increased to an aggregate principal amount equal to no greater than 9.667 million while other terms remain
unchanged. On October 26, 2023, the Company agreed to issue and sell, in a private placement, subject to the satisfaction of certain
closing conditions, an additional unsecured senior convertible promissory note in the principal amount of 1.75 million (the October
2023 Notes and together with the June 2023 Notes, the Notes ), which resulted in 2,550,000 of the Notes outstanding
as of June 30, 2024. 

Under
the Notes, we are required to pay interest on the last trading day of each quarter. Interest accrues on the principal amount of the Notes
at the interest rate, which resets daily and accrue, as follows: (a) for payments made in cash, at a rate equal to the Prime Rate plus
4.75 per annum, and (b) for payments made in shares of common stock, at a rate equal to the Prime Rate plus 7.75 per annum. 

12 

Our
ability to make payments due to the holders of the Notes using shares of common stock is subject to certain limitations set forth in
the Notes, including a limit on the number of shares that may be issued until our receipt of stockholder approval to issue 20 or more
of our outstanding shares of common stock to the holders of the Notes . If we are unable to make payments in shares of common stock,
we may be forced to make such payments in cash. If we do not have sufficient cash resources to make these payments, we may need to raise
additional equity or debt capital, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in doing so. If are unable to raise
sufficient capital to meet our payment obligations, we may need to delay, reduce or eliminate certain of our operations, sell some or
all of our assets or merge with another entity. 

Our
ability to make payments due to the holders of the Notes using cash is also limited by the amount of cash we have on hand at the time
such payments are due, as well as certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Further, we intend to make the installment
payments due to holders of Notes in the form of common stock to the extent allowed under the Notes and applicable law in order to preserve
our cash resources. The issuance of shares of common stock to the holders of our Notes will increase the number of shares of common stock
outstanding and could result in substantial dilution to the existing holders of our common stock. 

On
March 29, 2024, the Group noted that an Event of Default has occurred under the June 2023 Notes and October 2023 Notes, due to the Group s
failure to observe or perform in a material respect a material covenant, condition or agreement contained in the notes or a transaction
document and that such default was not fully cured within five (5) business days of such failure. As a result, the interest rate of the
June 2023 Notes and October 2023 Notes was automatically increased to 18 per annum, starting from the date of occurrence of the Event
of Default. In addition, the Group is obligated to pay to the holder of the June 2023 Note and October 2023 Note all of the outstanding
principal amount and accrued interest on the date of occurrence of the Event of Default. As of the date of issuance of the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements, the noteholder has not declared that an Event of Default has occurred and that the notes
are due and payable. As a result of the default, the carrying amounts of both June 2023 Note and October 2023 Note were classified as
convertible notes, current and all the remaining unamortized debt discounts were amortized into interest expense immediately. 

The
Notes contain anti-dilution provisions that may result in the reduction of the conversion price of the Notes in the future. These features
may increase the number of shares of common stock being issuable upon conversion of the Notes. 

The
Notes contain anti-dilution provisions, which provisions require the lowering of the applicable conversion price or exercise, as then
in effect, to the purchase price of equity or equity-linked securities issued in any subsequent offerings. If in the future, while any
of the Notes are outstanding, we issue securities for a consideration per share of common stock (the New Issuance Price that is less than the conversion price of the Notes, as then in effect, we will be required, subject to certain limitations and adjustments
as provided in the Notes, to reduce the conversion price to be equal to the New Issuance Price, which will result in a greater number
of shares of common stock being issuable upon conversion of the Notes, which in turn will increase the dilutive effect of such conversions
or exercises on existing holders of our common stock. The potential for such additional issuances may depress the price of our common
stock regardless of our business performance and may make it difficult for us to raise additional equity capital while any of the Notes
are outstanding. 

Under
the SPA, we are subject to certain restrictive covenants that may make it difficult to procure additional financing. 

The
SPA contains the following restrictive covenants: until thirty (30) days after such time as 80 of Notes have been repaid in full and/or
have been converted into common stock, we agreed not to enter into: 

(a) 
 any
 debt, equity or equity linked securities (including options or warrants) that are convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for,
 or include the right to receive shares of common stock: (i) at a conversion, repayment, exercise or exchange rate or other
 price that varies over time based upon a discount to the future trading prices of, or quotations for, shares of common stock; or
 (ii) at a conversion, repayment, exercise or exchange rate or other price that is subject to being reset at some future date
 after the initial issuance of such debt, equity or equity linked security or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events
 (other than warrants that may be repriced by the Company); or 

(b) 
 any
 securities in a capital or debt raising transaction or series of related transactions which grant to an investor the right to receive
 additional securities based upon future transactions of the Company on terms more favorable than those granted to such investor in
 such first transaction or series of related transactions; 

13 

If
we require additional funding while these restrictive covenants remain in effect, we may be unable to effect a financing transaction
while remaining in compliance with the terms of the SPA , or we may be forced to seek a waiver from the investors party to the SPA. 

If
we do not receive approval from our stockholders, we will be unable to pay amounts due to the holders of the Notes in shares of common
stock and we will be required to pay such amounts in cash, which may force us to divert cash from other uses. 

Under
the SPA, we are required to hold a meeting of our stockholders to seek approval under Rule 5635(d) of the Nasdaq Stock Market for the
sale, issuance or potential issuance by us of our common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock) in
excess of 4,256,256 shares, which is 19.99 of the shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the SPA.
If our stockholders do not approve this proposal, we will not be able to issue 20 or more of our outstanding shares of common stock
to the Notes holders in connection with the SPA. As a result, we may be unable to make some of the interest payments due to the holders
of the Notes in shares of our common stock or issue sufficient shares upon conversion of the Notes, which will, in lieu of those shares,
require that we pay substantial cash amounts to the Notes holders. If we do not have sufficient cash resources to make these payments,
we may need to delay, reduce or eliminate certain of our operations, sell some or all of our assets or merge with another entity.
