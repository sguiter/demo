or dissolution; or the common stock ceases to be listed on the market upon which it currently trades. 

The holders of the Series C Redeemable Preferred
Stock are entitled to vote on any matter submitted to the stockholders of the Company for a vote. share of Series C Redeemable Preferred
Stock carries the same voting rights as share of common stock. 

A redeemable equity security is to be classified
as temporary equity if it is conditionally redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer.
Upon the determination that such events are probable, the equity security would be classified as a liability. Given the Series C Redeemable
Preferred Stock contains a fundamental change provision, the security is considered conditionally redeemable. Therefore, the Company has
classified the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock as temporary equity in the balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023 until such time that events occur that indicate otherwise.

years expiring in August 2025. The Company has elected to account for the lease and non-lease components (insurance and property
taxes) as a single lease component for its real estate leases. Lease payments, which includes lease components and non-lease components,
are included in the measurement of the Company s lease liabilities to the extent that such payments are either fixed amounts or
variable amounts based on a rate or index (fixed in substance) as stipulated in the lease contract. Any actual costs in excess of such
amounts are expensed as incurred as variable lease cost. 

The Company s lease agreements generally
do not specify an implicit borrowing rate, and as such, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value
of the future lease payments. The discount rate represents a risk-adjusted rate on a secured basis and is the rate at which the Company
would borrow funds to satisfy the scheduled lease liability payment streams. The Company entered into a new five -year lease agreement
in June 2020 for new warehouse space located in Louisville, Kentucky. The Right of Use ROU asset value added as a result
of this new lease agreement was million. The Company s ROU asset and lease liability accounts reflect the inclusion of this
lease in the Company s balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The current monthly rent of thousand
increased from the commencement amount of thousand in September 2024 in accordance with the lease agreement, which requires that
the rent increase annually. 

The Company s lease agreements include options
for the Company to either renew or early terminate the lease. Renewal options are reviewed at lease commencement to determine if such
options are reasonably certain of being exercised, which could impact the lease term. When determining if a renewal option is reasonably
certain of being exercised, the Company considers several factors, including significance of leasehold improvements on the property, whether
the asset is difficult to replace, or specific characteristics unique to the lease that would make it reasonably certain that the Company
would exercise the option. In most cases, the Company has concluded that renewal and early termination options are not reasonably certain
of being exercised by the Company and thus not included in the Company s ROU asset and lease liability. 

 For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, total operating lease cost was thousand and thousand, respectively, and was recorded in direct operating costs.
Operating lease cost for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 amounted to thousand and thousand, respectively,
and was recorded in direct operating costs and general and administrative expenses. Operating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. The following summarizes (i) the future minimum undiscounted lease payments under the non-cancelable lease
for each of the next three years and thereafter, incorporating the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components as
a single lease component for our existing real estate lease, (ii) a reconciliation of the undiscounted lease payments to the present value

and Exchange Commission (the SEC an initial Statement on Schedule 13D, a Form 3 and a Form 4 (collectively, the Winvest
Filings indicating its ownership of approximately 67 of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the
 Common Stock ), of the Company. On October 28, 2024, Winvest provided the Company with a written consent (the Winvest

Winvest Consent.

developments and unanimously determined that under the circumstances, including Winvest s attempt to rapidly accumulate shares of
Common Stock and effect significant changes to the Company Bylaws and management, the implementation of a stockholder rights plan would
be in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders by protecting against Winvest s intention to take control of
the Company without appropriately compensating the rest of the Company s stockholders, which would if consummated, trigger fundamental
transaction and similar provisions in certain of the Company s outstanding Common Stock purchase warrants, material agreements
and the Company s Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series C Non-Convertible Voting Preferred Stock, all of
which taken together would leave the Company insolvent and at significant risk of having to file for bankruptcy.

 Series G Preferred Stock ), at a price of 0.05 per one-hundredth of a share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Rights
Agreement. The Rights are not exercisable until the earlier of: (1) the first date of public announcement by the Company or by an Acquiring
Person of such acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the outstanding Common Stock without the prior approval of the Board
or such earlier date as a majority of the Board shall become aware of the existence of an Acquiring Person, or (2) the tenth business
day (subject to extension by the Board) following the commencement of, or public announcement of an intention to commence, a tender or
exchange offer which would result in the beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the outstanding Common Stock (the Distribution
Date ). The Rights will expire upon the earlier of (i) November 1, 2027, unless otherwise extended by the Company s stockholders
or and (ii) redemption or exchange by the Company.

a Certificate of Designation, Preferences, and Rights of Series G Non-Convertible Voting Preferred Stock (the Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. This Certificate of Designation authorized 1,000,000 shares of the Series G Preferred

million and a net loss of 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and
cash equivalents of 5.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of 5.1 million. 

Given our cash position as of September 30, 2024, and our projected
cash flow from operations, we believe we will have sufficient capital to sustain operations for the twelve months from the date of the
filing of our interim condensed financial statements. We may also raise funds through equity or debt offerings to accelerate the execution
of our long-term strategic plan to develop and commercialize our new products.

the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock dividends amounting to 0.2 million each
period. 

Impact of Inflation 

We believe that our business has been modestly impacted by domestic
inflationary trends during the past two fiscal years, which have been offset with selective price increases and productivity improvements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would
have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
In addition, we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt, and we have not entered into any synthetic leases. We are, therefore,
not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

There were no significant changes to our critical
accounting policies and estimates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, from those disclosed in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

We are not required to provide the information required by this Item
3 as we are a smaller reporting company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we are required to perform an evaluation
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024.
Management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were
no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024
that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting . 

Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control 

Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud.
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent
limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of a person, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur
and not be detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may become subject to legal
proceedings, claims, or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not presently a party to any other legal proceedings
that in the opinion of our management, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect
on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

As a smaller reporting company,
we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

During the three months ended September 30,
2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 65,572 fully vested stock options were granted under the Company s 2023 Stock
Incentive Plan (the 2023 Plan to four non-employee directors at an exercise price of 0.61 per share in each case in

any claims or defenses, on the part of any party hereto. This Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreements, and any other evidence of

limitation the releases set forth in this Agreement, and that it has not sold, assigned, granted, transferred or hypothecated any right,
title or interest in any such claims, counterclaims, complaints, causes of action, suits, losses, demands, debts or expenses (including,
but not limited to, attorneys fees and costs actually incurred), liens, liabilities or damages to any other person or entity. 

7. Legends . 

(a) The
shares of Preferred Stock and the Conversion Shares may only be disposed of in compliance with state and federal securities laws. In connection
with any transfer of the shares of Preferred Stock and the Conversion Shares other than pursuant to an effective registration statement
or Rule 144 to the Company or to an Affiliate (as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) of a Holder or in connection with a pledge
as contemplated in Section 7(b), the Company may require the transferor thereof to provide to the Company an opinion of counsel selected
by the transferor and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the form and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, to the effect that such transfer does not require registration of such transferred shares of Preferred Stock and the Conversion
Shares under the Securities Act. 

(b) The
Holders agree to the imprinting, so long as is required by this Section 7, of a legend on any of the shares of Preferred Stock and the
Conversion Shares in the substantially the following form, as applicable: 

7 

[NEITHER] THIS
SECURITY [NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THIS SECURITY IS CONVERTIBLE] [HAS][HAS NOT] BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED (THE SECURITIES ACT ), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS
OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THIS SECURITY [AND THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION
OF THIS SECURITY] MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT WITH A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER OR OTHER LOAN WITH A FINANCIAL
INSTITUTION THAT IS AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR AS DEFINED IN RULE 501(a) UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR OTHER LOAN SECURED BY SUCH
SECURITIES. 

The Company acknowledges
and agrees that a Holder may from time to time pledge pursuant to a bona fide margin agreement with a registered broker-dealer or grant
a security interest in some or all of the shares of Preferred Stock or the Conversion Shares to a financial institution that is an accredited
investor as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act and, if required under the terms of such arrangement, such Holder may
transfer pledged or secured shares of Preferred Stock or Conversion Shares to the pledgees or secured parties. Such a pledge or transfer
would not be subject to approval of the Company and no legal opinion of legal counsel of the pledgee, secured party or pledgor shall be
required in connection therewith. Further, no notice shall be required of such pledge. At the appropriate Holder s expense, the
Company agrees to execute and deliver such reasonable documentation as a pledgee or secured party of shares of Preferred Stock and Conversion
Shares may reasonably request in connection with a pledge or transfer of any such securities. 

(c) Any certificate
or book-entry notation evidencing the shares of Preferred Stock and the Conversion Shares shall not contain any legend (including the
legend set forth in Section 7(b) hereof): (i) while a registration statement covering the resale of such security is effective under the
Securities Act, or (ii) following any sale of such shares of Preferred Stock or Conversion Shares pursuant to Rule 144, or (iii) if such
shares of Preferred Stock or Conversion Shares are eligible for sale under Rule 144 without volume or manner-of-sale limitations, or (iv)
if such legend is not required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including judicial interpretations and pronouncements
issued by the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission )). The Company shall cause its
counsel to issue a legal opinion to the Company s transfer agent or a Holder promptly if required by the Company s transfer
agent to effect the removal of the legend hereunder, or if requested by a Holder, respectively. If all or any portion of a share of Series
H Preferred Stock is converted at a time when there is an effective registration statement to cover the resale of the Conversion Shares,
or if the shares of Preferred Stock or Conversion Shares may be sold under Rule 144 without volume or manner-of-sale limitations, or if
such legend is not otherwise required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including judicial interpretations and pronouncements
issued by the staff of the Commission) then such shares of Series H Preferred Stock and Conversion Shares shall be issued free of all
legends. The Company agrees that following such time as such legend is no longer required under this Section 7(c), the Company will, no
later than the earlier of (i) one (1) trading day and (ii) the number of trading days comprising the Standard Settlement Period following
the delivery by a Holder to the Company or the Company s transfer agent of a certificate representing shares of Preferred Stock
or Conversion Shares, as applicable, issued with a restrictive legend (such date, the Legend Removal Date ), deliver
or cause to be delivered to such Holder a certificate, if applicable, representing such shares that is free from all restrictive and other
legends. The Company may not make any notation on its records or give instructions to the Company s transfer agent that enlarge
the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section 7. Certificates or book entries for Conversion Shares subject to legend removal
hereunder shall be transmitted by the Company s transfer agent to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder s prime
broker with the Depository Trust Company System as directed by such Holder. Standard Settlement Period means the
standard settlement period, expressed in a number of trading days, on the Company s primary trading market with respect to the Common
Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of a certificate, if applicable, representing shares of Preferred Stock or Conversion Shares
issued with a restrictive legend.

23. Independent
Nature of Holders Obligations and Rights . The obligations of each Holder under any Transaction Document are several and not
joint with the obligations of any other Holder, and no Holder shall be responsible in any way for the performance or non-performance of
the obligations of any other Holder under any Transaction Document. Nothing contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, and
no action taken by any Holder pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Holder as a partnership, an association, a
joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Holders are in any way acting in concert or as a group with
respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Each Holder shall be entitled to independently
protect and enforce its rights including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction
Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Holder to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.
Each Holder has been represented by its own separate legal counsel in its review and negotiation of the applicable Transaction Documents.
For reasons of administrative convenience only, each Holder and its respective counsel have chosen to communicate with the Company through
Pryor Cashman LLP. Pryor Cashman LLP does not represent any of the Holders and only represents Roth. The Company has elected to provide
all Holders with the same terms and applicable Transaction Documents for the convenience of the Company and not because it was required
or requested to do so by any of the Holders. It is expressly understood and agreed that each provision contained in this Agreement and
in each other applicable Transaction Document is between the Company and a Holder, solely, and not between the Company and the Holders
collectively and not between and among the Holders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, each of the Holders has
been advised, and is being advised by this Agreement, to consult with an attorney before executing this Agreement, and each Holder has
consulted (or had an opportunity to consult) with counsel of such Holder s choice concerning the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the other applicable Transaction Documents for a reasonable period of time prior to the execution hereof and thereof. 

24. Equal
Treatment of Holders; Most Favored Nation . No consideration (including any modification of any Transaction Document) shall be offered
or paid to any Holder hereto to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any provision of the Transaction Documents unless the
same consideration is also offered to all of the other Holders. For clarification purposes, this provision constitutes a separate right
granted to each Holder by the Company and negotiated separately by each Holder, and is intended for the Company to treat the Holders as
a class and shall not in any way be construed as the Holders acting in concert or as a group with respect to any purchase, disposition
or voting of securities of the Company or otherwise. The Company hereby represents and warrants as of the date hereof and covenants and
agrees that for so long as a Holder holds any shares of Preferred Stock, in the event that the Company issues or sells any Common Stock
or Common Stock Equivalents, if a Holder then holding outstanding shares of Preferred Stock reasonably believes that any of the terms
and conditions appurtenant to such issuance or sale are more favorable to such investors than are the terms and conditions granted to
the Holders pursuant to the Transaction Documents, upon notice to the Company by such Holder within ten (10) trading days after disclosure
of such issuance or sale, the Company shall amend the terms of this transaction as to such Holder only so as to give such Holder the benefit
of such more favorable terms or conditions. This Section 24 shall not apply with respect to an Exempt Issuance. The Company shall provide
each Holder with notice of any such issuance or sale not later than five (5) trading days before such issuance or sale. 

25. Further
Assurances . Each of the parties hereto agree to execute and deliver such further instruments, and to take such further actions, as
may be reasonably necessary or proper to effectuate and carry the purposes of this Agreement. 

26. No
Assignment . This Agreement may not be assigned, conveyed or otherwise transferred, in whole or in part, by any party hereto (other
than by the operation of law in connection with a merger or sale) without express written consent of the other non-assigning parties. 

27. Counterparts .
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and each counterpart, when executed, shall have the efficacy of a signed original. Photographic,
emailed, imaged and facsimiled copies of such signed counterparts may be used in lieu of the originals for any purpose. 

28. Headings .
The headings of the paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted for reference only and are not part of this Agreement and are not
to be used in any way in the construction or interpretation hereof.

of the Registrable Securities that are not then registered on an effective Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a continuous
basis pursuant to Rule 415. Each Registration Statement filed hereunder shall be on Form S-3 (except if the Company is not then eligible
to register for resale the Registrable Securities on Form S-3, in which case such registration shall be on another appropriate form in
accordance herewith, subject to the provisions of Section 2(e)) and shall contain (unless otherwise directed by at least 85 in interest
of the Holders) substantially the Plan of Distribution attached hereto as Annex A and substantially the Selling
Stockholder section attached hereto as Annex B ; provided , however , that no Holder shall be required to
be named as an underwriter without such Holder s express prior written consent. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
the Company shall use its best efforts to cause a Registration Statement filed under this Agreement (including, without limitation, under
Section 3(c)) to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as possible after the filing thereof, but in any event no
later than the applicable Effectiveness Date, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep such Registration Statement continuously
effective under the Securities Act until the date that all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement (i) have been
sold, thereunder or pursuant to Rule 144, or (ii) may be sold without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144 and without
the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144, as determined by the
counsel to the Company pursuant to a written opinion letter to such effect, addressed and acceptable to the Transfer Agent and the affected
Holders (the Effectiveness Period ). The Company shall telephonically request effectiveness of a Registration Statement
as of 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on a Trading Day. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders via facsimile or by e-mail of
the effectiveness of a Registration Statement on the same Trading Day that the Company telephonically confirms effectiveness with the

City time) on the Trading Day after the effective date of such Registration Statement, file a final Prospectus with the Commission as
required by Rule 424. Failure to so notify the Holder within one (1) Trading Day of such notification of effectiveness or failure to file
a final Prospectus as foresaid shall be deemed an Event under Section 2(d). 

(b) 
Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in Section 2(a), if the Commission informs the Company that all of the Registrable
Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single registration
statement, the Company agrees to promptly inform each of the Holders thereof and use its commercially reasonable efforts to file amendments
to the Initial Registration Statement as required by the Commission, covering the maximum number of Registrable Securities permitted to
be registered by the Commission, on Form S-3 or such other form available to register for resale the Registrable Securities as a secondary
offering, subject to the provisions of Section 2(e); with respect to filing on Form S-3 or other appropriate form, and subject to the
provisions of Section 2(d) with respect to the payment of liquidated damages; provided , however , that prior to filing such
amendment, the Company shall be obligated to use diligent efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all of the Registrable
Securities in accordance with the SEC Guidance, including without limitation, Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 612.09. 

3 

(c) Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement and subject to the payment of liquidated damages pursuant to Section 2(d), if the Commission or
any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation on the number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered on a particular Registration
Statement as a secondary offering (and notwithstanding that the Company used diligent efforts to advocate with the Commission for the
registration of all or a greater portion of Registrable Securities), unless otherwise directed in writing by a Holder as to its Registrable
Securities, the number of Registrable Securities to be registered on such Registration Statement will be reduced as follows: 

a. First,
 the Company shall reduce or eliminate any securities to be included other than Registrable
 Securities; and 

b. Second, the Company shall reduce Registrable Securities
represented by Conversion Shares (applied, in the case that some Series H Preferred Stock Shares may be registered, to the Holders on
a pro rata basis based on the total number of unregistered Series H Preferred Stock Shares held by such Holders); 

In
the event of a cutback hereunder, the Company shall give the Holder at least five (5) Trading Days prior written notice along with the
calculations as to such Holder s allotment. In the event the Company amends the Initial Registration Statement in accordance with

all of the Registrable Securities is not declared effective by the Commission by the Effectiveness Date of the Initial Registration Statement,
or (v) after the effective date of a Registration Statement, such Registration Statement ceases for any reason to remain continuously

as so supplemented. 

5 

(c) If
during the Effectiveness Period, the number of Registrable Securities at any time exceeds 100 of the number of shares of Common Stock

applicable Filing Date, an additional Registration Statement covering the resale by the Holders of not less than the number of such Registrable

Statement ineligible for inclusion therein or any statement made in a Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated
or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires any revisions to a Registration Statement,
Prospectus or other documents so that, in the case of a Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, it will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (vi) of the occurrence or existence of any pending
corporate development with respect to the Company that the Company believes may be material and that, in the determination of the Company,
makes it not in the best interest of the Company to allow continued availability of a Registration Statement or Prospectus; provided ,
 however , that in no event shall any such notice contain any information which would constitute material, non-public information
regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

6 

(e) Use
its best efforts to avoid the issuance of, or, if issued, obtain the withdrawal of (i) any order stopping or suspending the effectiveness
of a Registration Statement, or (ii) any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities
for sale in any jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment. 

(f) Furnish
to each Holder, without charge, at least one conformed copy of each such Registration Statement and each amendment thereto, including
financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference to the extent requested
by such Person, and all exhibits to the extent requested by such Person (including those previously furnished or incorporated by reference)
promptly after the filing of such documents with the Commission; provided, that any such item which is available on the EDGAR system (or
successor thereto) need not be furnished in physical form. 

(g) Subject
to the terms of this Agreement, the Company hereby consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by
each of the selling Holders in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and any
amendment or supplement thereto, except after the giving of any notice pursuant to Section 3(d). 

(h) 
Prior to any resale of Registrable Securities by a Holder, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify or cooperate
with the selling Holders in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from the Registration or qualification) of
such Registrable Securities for the resale by the Holder under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United
States as any Holder reasonably requests in writing, to keep each registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during
the Effectiveness Period and to do any and all other acts or things reasonably necessary to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions
of the Registrable Securities covered by each Registration Statement, provided that the Company shall not be required to qualify generally
to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, subject the Company to any material tax in any such jurisdiction
where it is not then so subject or file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction. 

(i) If
requested by a Holder, cooperate with such Holder to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates, if applicable, representing
Registrable Securities to be delivered to a transferee pursuant to a Registration Statement, which certificates shall be free, to the
extent permitted by the Settlement Agreement, of all restrictive legends, and to enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations
and registered in such names as any such Holder may request. 

7 

(j) Upon the
occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(d), as promptly as reasonably possible under the circumstances taking into account
the Company s good faith assessment of any adverse consequences to the Company and its stockholders of the premature disclosure
of such event, prepare a supplement or amendment, including a post-effective amendment, to a Registration Statement or a supplement to
the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, and file any other required document
so that, as thereafter delivered, neither a Registration Statement nor such Prospectus will contain an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. If the Company notifies the Holders in accordance
with clauses (iii) through (vi) of Section 3(d) above to suspend the use of any Prospectus until the requisite changes to such Prospectus
have been made, then the Holders shall suspend use of such Prospectus. The Company will use its best efforts to ensure that the use of
the Prospectus may be resumed as promptly as is practicable. The Company shall be entitled to exercise its right under this Section 3(j)
to suspend the availability of a Registration Statement and Prospectus, subject to the payment of partial liquidated damages otherwise
required pursuant to Section 2(d), for a period not to exceed 60 calendar days (which need not be consecutive days) in any 12-month period . 

(k) Otherwise
use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, Rule 172 under the Securities Act, file any final Prospectus, including any supplement
or amendment thereof, with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, promptly inform the Holders in writing if, at
any time during the Effectiveness Period, the Company does not satisfy the conditions specified in Rule 172 and, as a result thereof,
the Holders are required to deliver a Prospectus in connection with any disposition of Registrable Securities and take such other actions
as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate the registration of the Registrable Securities hereunder. 

(l) The
Company shall use its best efforts to maintain eligibility for use of Form S-3 (or any successor form thereto) for the registration of
the resale of Registrable Securities. 

(m) The
Company may require each selling Holder to furnish to the Company a certified statement as to the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially
owned by such Holder and, if required by the Commission, the natural persons thereof that have voting and dispositive control over the
shares. During any periods that the Company is unable to meet its obligations hereunder with respect to the registration of the Registrable
Securities solely because any Holder fails to furnish such information within three Trading Days of the Company s request, any liquidated
damages that are accruing at such time as to such Holder only shall be tolled and any Event that may otherwise occur solely because of
such delay shall be suspended as to such Holder only, until such information is delivered to the Company.

with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles, notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title) of each
of them, each Person who controls any such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act) and the officers, directors, members, stockholders, partners, agents and employees (and any other Persons with a functionally equivalent
role of a Person holding such titles, notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title) of each such controlling Person, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys fees) and expenses (collectively, Losses ), as incurred, arising out of or
relating to (1) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement, any Prospectus or any

or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus

by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law, or any rule or regulation thereunder, in connection
with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent, but only to the extent, that (i) such untrue statements
or omissions are based solely upon information regarding such Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for
use therein, or to the extent that such information relates to such Holder or such Holder s proposed method of distribution of Registrable

(b) Indemnification

and employees, each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange
Act), and the directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling Persons, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
from and against all Losses, as incurred, to the extent arising out of or based solely upon: any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary
prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading (i) to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information
so furnished in writing by such Holder to the Company expressly for inclusion in such Registration Statement or such Prospectus or (ii)
to the extent, but only to the extent, that such information relates to such Holder s information provided in the Selling Stockholder
Questionnaire or the proposed method of distribution of Registrable Securities and was reviewed and expressly approved in writing by such
Holder expressly for use in a Registration Statement (it being understood that the Holder has approved Annex A hereto for this purpose),
such Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto. In no event shall the liability of a selling Holder be greater in amount than
the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of all expenses paid by such Holder in connection with any claim relating to this Section 5 and
the amount of any damages such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or omission) received by such
Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement giving rise to such indemnification obligation. 

(c) Conduct
of Indemnification Proceedings . If any Proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any Person entitled to indemnity hereunder
(an Indemnified Party ), such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Person from whom indemnity is sought (the
 Indemnifying Party in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, including
the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with defense thereof, provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have materially
and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. 

An Indemnified
Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in
writing to pay such fees and expenses, (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such Proceeding
and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding, or (3) the named parties to any such Proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and counsel to the Indemnified Party
shall reasonably believe that a material conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to
employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense
thereof and the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one separate counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party).
The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
effect any settlement of any pending Proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party, unless such settlement includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding. 

10 

Subject to the
terms of this Agreement, all reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable fees and expenses to the extent
incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such Proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this Section) shall
be paid to the Indemnified Party, as incurred, within ten Trading Days of written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, provided that
the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for that portion of such fees and expenses applicable to such actions
for which such Indemnified Party is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal
or further review) not to be entitled to indemnification hereunder. 

(d) Contribution .
If the indemnification under Section 5(a) or 5(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party
harmless for any Losses, then each Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party, in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions,
statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by,
or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party
as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, any reasonable attorneys 
or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any Proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified
for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section was available to such party in accordance with its terms. 

The parties hereto
agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or
by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. In no event shall the contribution obligation of a Holder of Registrable Securities be greater in amount than the dollar amount
of the proceeds (net of all expenses paid by such Holder in connection with any claim relating to this Section 5 and the amount of any
damages such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission)
received by it upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such contribution obligation. 

The indemnity and
contribution agreements contained in this Section are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the Indemnified
Parties.

6. Miscellaneous . 

(a) Remedies .

Company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this Agreement, including recovery
of damages, shall be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. Each of the Company and each Holder agrees that
monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions
of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall
not assert or shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

(b) No
Piggyback on Registrations; Prohibition on Filing Other Registration Statements . Neither the Company nor any of its security holders
(other than the Holders in such capacity pursuant hereto) may include securities of the Company in any Registration Statements other than
the Registrable Securities. The Company shall not file any other registration statements until all Registrable Securities are registered

efforts to ensure that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed as promptly as is practicable. The Company agrees and acknowledges that
any periods during which the Holder is required to discontinue the disposition of the Registrable Securities hereunder shall be subject
to the provisions of Section 2(d). 

(e) Piggy-Back
Registrations . If, at any time during the Effectiveness Period, there is not an effective Registration Statement covering all of the

offering for its own account or the account of others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities, other than on Form S-4
or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under the Securities Act) or their then equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely
in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in connection with the Company s stock
option or other employee benefit plans, then the Company shall deliver to each Holder a written notice of such determination and, if within
fifteen days after the date of the delivery of such notice, any such Holder shall so request in writing, the Company shall include in
such registration statement all or any part of such Registrable Securities such Holder requests to be registered; provided , however ,
that the Company shall not be required to register any Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 6(e) that are eligible for resale
pursuant to Rule 144 (without volume restrictions or current public information requirements) promulgated by the Commission pursuant to
the Securities Act or that are the subject of a then effective Registration Statement that is available for resales or other dispositions
by such Holder. 

(f) Amendments
and Waivers . The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented,
and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the
Company and the Holders of 50.1 or more of the then outstanding Registrable Securities (for purposes of clarification, this includes
any Registrable Securities issuable upon exercise or conversion of any Series H Preferred Stock), provided that, if any amendment, modification
or waiver disproportionately and adversely impacts a Holder (or group of Holders), the consent of such disproportionately impacted Holder
(or group of Holders) shall be required. If a Registration Statement does not register all of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a
waiver or amendment done in compliance with the previous sentence, then the number of Registrable Securities to be registered for each
Holder shall be reduced pro rata among all Holders and each Holder shall have the right to designate which of its Registrable Securities
shall be omitted from such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof
with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of a Holder or some Holders and that does not directly or indirectly affect
the rights of other Holders may be given only by such Holder or Holders of all of the Registrable Securities to which such waiver or consent
relates; provided , however , that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified, or supplemented except in
accordance with the provisions of the first sentence of this Section 6(f). No consideration shall be offered or paid to any Person to
amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any provision of this Agreement unless the same consideration also is offered to all of
the parties to this Agreement.

or by e-mail delivery of a .pdf format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party
executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or .pdf signature
page were an original thereof. 

(k) Governing
Law . All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be determined in
accordance with the provisions of the Settlement Agreement. 

(l) Cumulative
Remedies . The remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law. 

(m) Severability .
If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force
and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such term, provision,
covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have executed the remaining
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such that may be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable. 

(n) Headings .
The headings in this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of the Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or
affect any of the provisions hereof. 

(o) Independent
Nature of Holders Obligations and Rights . The obligations of each Holder hereunder are several and not joint with the obligations
of any other Holder hereunder, and no Holder shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other Holder
hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any other agreement or document delivered at any closing, and no action taken by any Holder
pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Holders as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind
of group or entity, or create a presumption that the Holders are in any way acting in concert or as a group or entity with respect to
such obligations or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other matters, and the Company acknowledges that the Holders
are not acting in concert or as a group, and the Company shall not assert any such claim, with respect to such obligations or transactions.
Each Holder shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights, including without limitation the rights arising out of this Agreement,
and it shall not be necessary for any other Holder to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. The use of
a single agreement with respect to the obligations of the Company contained was solely in the control of the Company, not the action or
decision of any Holder, and was done solely for the convenience of the Company and not because it was required or requested to do so by
any Holder. It is expressly understood and agreed that each provision contained in this Agreement is between the Company and a Holder,
solely, and not between the Company and the Holders collectively and not between and among Holders.

Annex A 

Plan of Distribution 

Each Selling Stockholder (the
 Selling Stockholders of the securities and any of their pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from
time to time, sell any or all of their securities covered hereby on the principal Trading Market or any other stock exchange, market or
trading facility on which the securities are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. A Selling
Stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling securities: 

ordinary
 brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers; 

block
 trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position
 and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; 

purchases
 by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; 

an
 exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; 

privately negotiated transactions; 

settlement of short sales; 

in transactions through broker-dealers that agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a specified number of such securities at a
stipulated price per security; 

through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise; 

a combination of any such methods of sale; or 

any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. 

The Selling Stockholders may
also sell securities under Rule 144 or any other exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
Act ), if available, rather than under this prospectus. 

Broker-dealers engaged by
the Selling Stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts
from the Selling Stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of securities, from the purchaser) in amounts
to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this Prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a
customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in
compliance with FINRA IM-2440. 

16 

In connection with the sale
of the securities or interests therein, the Selling Stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial
institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the securities in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling
Stockholders may also sell securities short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the securities
to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling Stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with
broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer
or other financial institution of securities offered by this prospectus, which securities such broker-dealer or other financial institution
may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). 

The Selling Stockholders and
any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the securities may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning
of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any
profit on the resale of the securities purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities
Act. Each Selling Stockholder has informed the Company that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly
or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities. 

The Company is required to
pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the Company incident to the registration of the securities. The Company has agreed to indemnify
the Selling Stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. 

We agreed to keep this prospectus
effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the securities may be resold by the Selling Stockholders without registration and
without regard to any volume or manner-of-sale limitations by reason of Rule 144, without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance
with the current public information under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the securities
have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale securities
will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in
certain states, the resale securities covered hereby may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable
state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with. 

Under applicable rules and
regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale securities may not simultaneously engage in market
making activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement
of the distribution. In addition, the Selling Stockholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of the common stock by the Selling
Stockholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling Stockholders and have informed them
of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule
172 under the Securities Act).

SELLING STOCKHOLDERS 

The common stock being offered
by the selling stockholders are those previously issued to the selling stockholders, and those issuable to the selling stockholders, upon
conversion of the Series H Convertible Non-Voting Preferred Stock. For additional information regarding the issuances of those shares
of common stock and Series H Convertible Preferred Stock, see [_____] above. We are registering the shares of common stock
in order to permit the selling stockholders to offer the shares for resale from time to time. Except for the ownership of the shares of
common stock, warrants to purchase common stock and the Series H Convertible Preferred Stock, the selling stockholders have not had any
material relationship with us within the past three years. 

The table below lists the
selling stockholders and other information regarding the beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock by each of the selling stockholders.
The second column lists the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by each selling shareholder, based on its ownership of
the shares of common stock and Series H Convertible Preferred Stock, as of ________, 20__, assuming conversion of the Series H Convertible
Preferred Stock held by the selling stockholders on that date, without regard to any limitations on conversions. 

The third column lists the
shares of common stock being offered by this prospectus by the selling stockholders. 

In accordance with the terms
of a registration rights agreement with the selling stockholders, this prospectus generally covers the resale of the maximum number of
shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the related Series H Convertible Preferred Stock, determined as if the outstanding
Series H Convertible Preferred Stock were converted in full as of the trading day immediately preceding the date this registration statement
was initially filed with the SEC, each as of the trading day immediately preceding the applicable date of determination and all subject
to adjustment as provided in the registration right agreement, without regard to any limitations on the exercise of the Series H Convertible
Preferred Stock. The fourth column assumes the sale of all of the shares offered by the selling stockholders pursuant to this prospectus. 

Pursuant to the Certificate
of Designation of the Series H Convertible Preferred Stock, a selling shareholder may not convert shares of the Series H Convertible Preferred
Stock to the extent such conversion would cause such selling shareholder, together with its affiliates and attribution parties, to beneficially
own a number of shares of common stock which would exceed 4.99 or 9.99 of our then outstanding common stock following such conversion,
excluding for purposes of such determination shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series H Convertible Preferred Stock
which have not been exercised. The number of shares in the second column does not reflect this limitation. The selling stockholders may
sell all, some or none of their shares in this offering. See Plan of Distribution.
