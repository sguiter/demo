Accordingly, these assets have been reclassified as assets held for sale within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented.

Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows Many of our derivatives do not qualify for, and we do not currently designate certain commodity or foreign currency derivatives to achieve, hedge accounting treatment. We reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivatives used to economically hedge anticipated commodity consumption and to mitigate foreign currency cash flow risk in earnings immediately within general corporate expense (within cost of goods sold). The gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating results in the period in which the underlying item being economically hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results immediately. The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions, under this methodology: Less: Net derivative losses allocated to reporting segments ) ) Net derivative gains (losses) recognized in general corporate expenses ) Net derivative losses allocated to Grocery Snacks ) ) Net derivative losses allocated to Refrigerated Frozen ) ) Net derivative losses allocated to International ) Net derivative losses allocated to Foodservice ) ) Net derivative losses included in segment operating profit ) ) The fair values of our derivative positions were not material as of August 25, 2024 and were Level 1 or Level 2 assets or liabilities in the fair value hierarchy (see Note 16 for further information).

In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we granted million restricted stock units at a weighted average grant date price of per share unit and million performance shares at a weighted average grant date price of per share. Performance shares are granted to selected executives and other key employees with vesting contingent upon meeting various Company-wide performance goals. The performance goals for the three -year performance periods ending in fiscal 2025 (the 2025 performance period and 2026 (the 2026 performance period are based on our net sales and diluted earnings per share EPS growth, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the defined performance period, with each year of the performance period weighted one-third. The performance goals for the three -year performance period ending in fiscal 2027 (the 2027 performance period is based on our net sales and diluted EPS on a three-year cumulative basis, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the defined performance period. For each of the 2025 performance period, 2026 performance period, and 2027 performance period, the awards actually earned will range from to two hundred percent of the targeted number of performance shares for such performance period. Dividend equivalents are paid on the portion of performance shares actually earned at our regular dividend rate in additional shares of common stock. Awards, if earned, will be paid in shares of our common stock. Subject to limited exceptions set forth in our performance share plan, any shares earned will be distributed after the end of the performance period, and generally only if the participant continues to be employed with the Company through the date of distribution. For awards where performance against the performance target has not been certified, the value of the performance shares is adjusted based upon the market price of our common stock and current forecasted performance against the performance targets at the end of each reporting period and amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period.

The effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 reflected a million deferred tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances booked against certain deferred tax assets. Recent interactions with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding certain elections that had previously been under IRS review make the realization of certain deferred tax assets likely. The realization of these deferred tax assets allows for both current and future tax deductions through 2036. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was in line with our expected effective tax rate of approximately . We have previously made the assessment that the current earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested or that we could not remit to the U.S. parent in a tax-neutral transaction. Accordingly, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of million on approximately million of cumulative earnings as of August 25, 2024. The deferred tax liability relates to local withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we paid million of withholding taxes previously accrued in connection with the restructuring of our ownership interest in Ardent Mills. million, in annual installments from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2026 (of which million had been paid as of August 25, 2024), as part of a 2019 settlement, which also included a guarantee of up to million in payments to be made in the event of default by a co-defendant, NL Industries, Inc. We had accrued million million within other accrued liabilities and million within other noncurrent liabilities) as of August 25, 2024 and million million within other accrued liabilities and million within other noncurrent liabilities) as of May 26, 2024. We are party to a number of matters asserting product liability claims against the Company related to certain Pam and other cooking spray products. For example, during fiscal 2024, a jury entered a verdict against the Company for million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages in one of these lawsuits captioned Reese v. Conagra Brands, Inc., et al. Reese . We have appealed the judgment in the Reese lawsuit. These lawsuits generally seek damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by defects in the design, manufacture, or safety warnings of our cooking spray products and we have denied liability, however, we cannot predict with certainty the results of these proceedings. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for the litigation related to the cooking spray products based on information available to us at the time of our evaluation. Additionally, we have put the applicable insurance carriers on notice of these cooking spray matters and had recognized a related insurance receivable of million million within receivables and million within other assets) as of August 25, 2024 and million million within receivables and million within other assets) as of May 26, 2024 in connection with a settlement agreement with one of these insurance carriers.

Environmental Matters Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about environmental proceedings if a governmental authority is a party to such proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe will exceed a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, the Company uses a threshold of million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. We are a party to certain environmental proceedings relating to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to our acquisition in fiscal 1991, including litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrice s possible status as a potentially responsible party at approximately 35 Superfund, proposed Superfund, or state-equivalent sites (the Beatrice sites ). The Beatrice sites consist of locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, polychlorinated biphenyls, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes, and/or other contaminants. Reserves for these Beatrice environmental proceedings have been established based on our best estimate of the undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required clean-up, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties, and its experience in remediating sites. The accrual for Beatrice-related environmental matters totaled million million within other accrued liabilities and million within other noncurrent liabilities as of August 25, 2024 and million million within other accrued liabilities and million within other noncurrent liabilities as of May 26, 2024, a majority of which relates to the Superfund and state-equivalent sites referenced above. General After taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity; however, it is reasonably possible that a change of the estimates of any of the foregoing matters may occur in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we contributed million to our pension plans and contributed million to our postretirement plans.

 Staples Other shelf-stable Refrigerated Snacks Foodservice International Total net sales To be consistent with the manner in which we present certain disaggregated net sales information to investors, we have categorized certain net sales of our segments as Staples , which includes all of our U.S. domestic retail refrigerated products and other shelf-stable grocery products. Management continues to regularly review financial results and make decisions about allocating resources based upon the reporting segments outlined above. Assets by Segment The majority of our manufacturing assets are shared across multiple reporting segments. Output from these facilities used by each reporting segment can change over time. Also, working capital balances are not tracked by reporting segment. Therefore, it is impracticable to allocate those assets to the reporting segments, as well as disclose total assets by segment. Total depreciation expense was million and million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Fiscal 2025 First Quarter Results In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, results reflected a decrease in net sales, with organic (excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange) decreases in our Grocery Snacks, Refrigerated Frozen, and Foodservice segments, offset by an increase in our

Table of Contents 
 International segment, in each case compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The overall decrease in net sales was primarily due to an increase in strategic trade investments and a decrease in volume. Overall gross profit decreased primarily as a result of lower net sales, input cost inflation, and unfavorable operating leverage, partially offset by higher productivity and lower transportation costs. Overall segment operating profit decreased in our Grocery Snacks, Refrigerated Frozen, and Foodservice segments, slightly offset by an increase in our International segment. Corporate expenses were higher primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses were higher due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense and items impacting comparability, as discussed below. We recognized lower equity method investment earnings and lower income tax expense, in each case compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding items impacting comparability, our effective tax rate was lower than the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 0.97 and 0.67, respectively. Diluted earnings per share was affected by higher net income, driven primarily by the release of valuation allowances discussed below, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Trends Impacting Our Business Our industry continues to be impacted by shifting consumer behavior, commodity cost fluctuations, exchange rate volatility, labor cost inflation, input cost inflation, supply chain disruptions, and other global macroeconomic challenges. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we experienced a moderate amount of input cost inflation and negative impacts from exchange rates, which we were able to be partially offset through our on-going productivity initiatives. We expect consumer trends to continue to evolve and our volumes to improve over time, however, economic pressures on consumers, including the challenges of high inflation, may continue to negatively impact our volumes throughout fiscal 2025. We will continue to evaluate the evolving macroeconomic environment to take action to mitigate the impact on our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition. Items Impacting Comparability Segment presentation of gains and losses from derivatives used for economic hedging of anticipated commodity input costs and foreign currency exchange rate risks of anticipated transactions is discussed in further detail in Note 8, Derivative Financial Instruments , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. We had 1.3 million of derivative losses in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 27.6 million of derivative gains in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which were included in general corporate expenses and reflected as items impacting comparability. Other items of note impacting comparability for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 included the following: an income tax benefit of 211.4 million primarily associated with the release of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets based upon interactions with the taxing authorities, a gain of 17.0 million 12.8 million after-tax) associated with insurance proceeds from the previous fire that occurred at one of our manufacturing facilities, charges totaling 4.3 million 3.2 million after-tax) in connection with our restructuring plans, and net charges totaling 3.4 million 2.6 million after-tax) related to legacy legal matters. 
 Items of note impacting comparability for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 included the following: charges totaling 24.4 million 18.1 million after-tax) in connection with our restructuring plans. 
 SEGMENT REVIEW We reflect our results of operations in four reporting segments: Grocery Snacks, Refrigerated Frozen, International, and Foodservice. Grocery Snacks The Grocery Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf-stable food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.

Table of Contents 
 Refrigerated Frozen The Refrigerated Frozen reporting segment principally includes branded, temperature-controlled food products sold in various retail channels in the United States. International The International reporting segment principally includes branded food products, in various temperature states, sold in various retail and foodservice channels outside of the United States. Foodservice The Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, sauces, and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products that are packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments primarily in the United States. Net Sales 

Net Sales in millions) Thirteen Weeks Ended Reporting Segment August 25, 2024 August 27, 2023 Inc (Dec) Grocery Snacks 1,182.7 1,202.9 (1.7) Refrigerated Frozen 1,086.4 1,151.6 (5.7) International 259.1 260.2 (0.4) Foodservice 266.7 289.3 (7.8) Total 2,794.9 2,904.0 (3.8) Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 in our Grocery Snacks segment included a decrease in volumes of 1.8 and a price/mix decrease of 0.1 , excluding the impact of acquisitions, when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The lower volumes are primarily due to the elasticity impact from inflation-driven pricing actions on certain brands within the portfolio and continued lower consumption trends. Price/mix was negatively impacted by an increase in strategic trade investments, offset by favorability in inflation-driven pricing that was implemented in the prior year. The acquisitions of Sweetwood Smoke Co. in August 2024 and an existing co-manufacturer of our cooking spray products in July 2024 contributed 2.7 million to our Grocery Snacks segment net sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 in our Refrigerated Frozen segment reflected a decrease in price/mix of 5.8 when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily attributable to an increase in strategic trade investments. Volume increased by 0.1 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Additionally, we estimate that net sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were impacted by approximately 24 million due to temporary manufacturing disruptions in our Hebrew National business during the key grilling season. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 in our International segment reflected a 3.4 decrease due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, a 2.4 increase in price/mix, and a 0.6 increase in volumes, in each case compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The unfavorable foreign exchange rates were primarily due to the devaluation of the Mexican Peso relative to the US dollar, and volume increases were driven by growth in our Global Exports business compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 in our Foodservice segment reflected a decrease in volumes of 11.1 , excluding the impact of acquisitions, when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in volumes was driven by the ongoing impact of lost business from the prior year and ongoing softness in restaurant traffic. Price/mix increased by 3.2 , compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, reflecting inflation-driven pricing and the value-over-volume strategy. Additionally, we estimate that net sales in our Foodservice segment during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were impacted by approximately 3 million due to the temporary manufacturing disruptions in our Hebrew National business. SG A Expenses (includes general corporate expenses) SG A expenses totaled 337.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 3.6 million, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. SG A expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 reflected the following: Items impacting comparability of earnings charges of 3.4 million related to legacy legal matters,

 a loss of 2.3 million on the sale of our ownership stake in Agro Tech Foods Limited , and net charges of 2.2 million in connection with our restructuring plans. 
 Other changes in expenses compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 an increase in share-based payment expense of 23.2 million primarily due to volatility between periods in our share price and a decrease in the estimated level of achievement of certain performance targets in the prior year, a decrease in short-term incentive expense of 8.5 million, a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of 8.3 million, and an increase in salary, wage, and fringe benefit expense of 3.8 million. 
 SG A expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 included the following items impacting comparability of earnings: net charges of 20.1 million in connection with our restructuring plans and a net gain of 3.3 million primarily associated with insurance proceeds expected from the previous fire that occurred at one of our manufacturing facilities. 
 Segment Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expenses, pension and postretirement non-service income (expense), interest expense, net, income taxes, and equity method investment earnings) 

Operating Profit in millions) Thirteen Weeks Ended Reporting Segment August 25, 2024 August 27, 2023 Inc (Dec) Grocery Snacks 249.1 258.7 (3.7) Refrigerated Frozen 176.0 199.2 (11.6) International 33.6 23.7 42.1 Foodservice 35.1 44.1 (20.4) Operating profit in our Grocery Snacks segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 reflected a decrease in gross profits of 13.6 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The lower gross profit was driven by the decrease in net sales discussed above, the impacts of input cost inflation, and unfavorable fixed cost leverage, slightly offset by higher productivity and a benefit of 3.3 million related to insurance proceeds received for lost sales from our previous brand recall on Armour Star . The decrease in gross profits was partially offset by lower SG A expenses, including a decrease of 2.4 million in advertising and promotion expenses. Operating profit in our Grocery Snacks segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 included charges of 4.2 million and 4.8 million, respectively, related to our restructuring plans. Operating profit in our Refrigerated Frozen segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 reflected a decrease in gross profits of 32.4 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was driven by the net sales decline discussed above and the impacts of input cost inflation, partially offset by productivity, lower transportation costs, and a gain of 17.0 million from insurance recoveries associated with a previous fire that occurred at one of our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we estimate that gross profits during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were negatively impacted by approximately 10 million, primarily due to lost profits, abnormal manufacturing variances, and certain inventory write-offs resulting from the temporary manufacturing disruptions in our Hebrew National business. The decrease in gross profits was partially offset by lower SG A expenses, including a decrease of 6.1 million in advertising and promotion expenses. Operating profit in our International segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 reflected a decrease in gross profits of 3.7 million when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was driven by the impacts of input cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by productivity. Operating profit in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 included a 2.3 million loss on the sale of our ownership stake in Agro Tech Foods Limited. Operating profit in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 included net charges of 18.6 million related to our restructuring plans. Operating profit in our Foodservice segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 reflected a decrease in gross profits of 5.2 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross profits was driven by the net sales decline discussed above, the impacts of input cost inflation, and unfavorable fixed cost leverage, partially offset by productivity.

 Pension and Postretirement Non-service Income (Expense) In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, pension and postretirement non-service income was 3.1 million compared to expense of 0.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The first quarter of fiscal 2025 reflected lower interest costs. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense was 105.8 million and 106.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. See Note 5, Debt and Revolving Credit Facility , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for further discussion. Income Taxes In the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, we recognized an income tax benefit of 138.9 million and income tax expense of 98.3 million, respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was approximately (42.4) and 23.5 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. See Note 12, Income Taxes , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for a discussion on the change in effective tax rates. Equity Method Investment Earnings Equity method investment earnings were 29.1 million and 35.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Ardent Mills earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 continued to reflect slightly lower volume trends as seen throughout the industry. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 0.97 and 0.67, respectively. The increase reflected higher net income in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Liquidity and Capital The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. We use a combination of equity and short- and long-term debt. We use short-term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts and other payables, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities). We strive to maintain solid investment grade credit ratings. Management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, our commercial paper program, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our debt obligations, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, other contractual obligations, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Borrowing Facilities and Long-Term Debt At August 25, 2024, we had a revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of 2.0 billion (subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 2.5 billion with the consent of the lenders). The Revolving Credit Facility matures on August 26, 2027 and is unsecured. The Company may request the term of the Revolving Credit Facility be extended for additional one-year or two-year periods from the then-applicable maturity date on an annual basis. We have historically used a credit facility principally as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of August 25, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of August 25, 2024, we had 926.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program. The highest level of borrowings outstanding during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 1.0 billion. We had 586.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program as of May 26, 2024. For additional information about our long-term debt balances, refer to Note 5, Debt and Revolving Credit Facility , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report and Note 3, Long-Term Debt , to the Consolidated Financial

 Statements contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2024. The weighted average coupon interest rate of long-term debt obligations outstanding as of August 25, 2024 was approximately 4.9 . We expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to retire or refinance long-term debt at maturity or otherwise, from operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, access to the capital markets, and our Revolving Credit Facility. We continuously evaluate opportunities to refinance our debt; however, any refinancing is subject to market conditions and other factors, including financing options that may be available to us from time to time, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully refinance any debt on commercially acceptable terms at all. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025, our senior long-term debt ratings were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, although borrowing costs would increase. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult, or impossible. Our most restrictive debt agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility) generally requires our ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA to interest expense not be less than 3.0 to 1.0 and our ratio of funded net debt to EBITDA not to exceed 4.5 to 1.0. Each ratio is to be calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis. As of August 25, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. Equity and Dividends We repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our Board. Under our current share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years, depending on market conditions and other factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. The share repurchase authorization has no expiration date. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock under this authorization for an aggregate of 64.0 million. The Company s total remaining share repurchase authorization as of August 25, 2024 was 852.6 million. On August 29, 2024, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend on shares of its common stock of 0.35 per share to stockholders of record as of close of business on August 1, 2024. On October 2, 2024, we announced that our Board had authorized a quarterly dividend of 0.35 per share to be paid on November 27, 2024, to stockholders of record as of close of business on October 31, 2024. Contractual Obligations As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments. These obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. In addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt and notes payable balances, discussed above, our contractual obligations primarily consist of lease payments, income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and unconditional purchase obligations. There were no material changes to our contractual obligations from those disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2024. Capital Expenditures We continue to make investments in our business and operating facilities. Our estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 is approximately 450 million. Cash Flows During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we generated 49.7 million of cash, which was the net result of 268.6 million generated from operating activities, 286.3 million used in investing activities, 70.1 million generated from financing activities, and a decrease of 2.7 million due to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Cash generated from operating activities totaled 268.6 million and 443.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flows for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by lower operating profits and changes in working capital, which were negatively impacted by increased accounts receivables and higher cash payments associated with our annual short-term incentive plan partially offset by lower inventory balances. Cash used in investing activities totaled 286.3 million and 138.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Investing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 consisted primarily of capital expenditures totaling 133.0 million, and the purchases of an existing co-manufacturer and Sweetwood Smoke Co. for a total of 230.4 million, net of cash acquired, which were partially

 offset by net proceeds totaling 76.8 million from the sale of our ownership stake in Agro Tech Foods Limited ATFL ). Investing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 consisted primarily of capital expenditures totaling 143.6 million. Cash generated from financing activities totaled 70.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 307.1 million used in financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 principally reflected net short-term borrowing issuances of 336.2 million, partially offset by cash dividends paid of 167.3 million and common stock repurchases of 64.0 million. Financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 principally reflected repayments of long-term debt of 504.3 million, the issuance of long-term debt totaling 500.0 million, net short-term borrowing repayments of 128.3 million, and cash dividends paid of 157.4 million. Cash Held by International Subsidiaries The Company had cash and cash equivalents of 128.7 million at August 25, 2024 and 77.7 million at May 26, 2024, of which 119.7 million at August 25, 2024 and 66.7 million at May 26, 2024 was held in foreign countries. A deferred tax liability is provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings that are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested or cannot be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. Other undistributed foreign earnings are invested indefinitely and therefore we have not provided deferred taxes on those earnings. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For further discussion of our critical accounting estimates, please refer to the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2024. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The principal market risks affecting us are exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs, interest rates, and foreign currencies. Other than the changes noted below, there have been no material changes in our market risk during the thirteen weeks ended August 25, 2024. For additional information, refer to the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2024. Commodity Market Risk We purchase commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, vegetable oils, pork, dairy products, and energy to be used in our operations. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk. We enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. We have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses. We also monitor the amount of associated counter-party credit risk for all non-exchange-traded transactions. Interest Rate Risk We may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt. The carrying amount of long-term debt (including current installments) was 7.51 billion as of August 25, 2024. Based on current market rates, the fair value of this debt at August 25, 2024 was estimated at 7.52 billion. As of August 25, 2024, a 1 increase in the interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 369.6 million, while a 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 416.2 million. Foreign Currency Risk In order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations. This activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.

 Effect of Hypothetical 10 Fluctuation The potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity and foreign exchange contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, would have been (in millions): 

Fair Value Impact In Millions August 25, 2024 August 27, 2023 Energy commodities 3.5 2.7 Agriculture commodities 7.3 6.7 Foreign exchange 10.1 9.5 It should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items. In relation to foreign currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of August 25, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended August 25, 2024 and determined that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended August 25, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 5. Change of Control . (a) If a Change of Control occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, and the Participant has not yet earned or forfeited such Participant s Performance Shares as of the date of such Change of Control, then the amount of the Participant s outstanding Performance Shares shall be determined as of the Change of Control in an amount equal to the Change of Control Value. The Change of Control Value shall mean the volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the closing date of the Change of Control multiplied by the number of Performance Shares that would have been earned for the full Performance Period, based on the greater of (1) Company performance for the Performance Period against the target performance, calculated as if the Performance Period ended on the last day of the Company s fiscal period that ended immediately preceding the date of the Change of Control and (2) Company performance at the targeted level for the Performance Period. In addition, the Performance Shares shall be subject to the following terms set forth below, as applicable. As used below, Replacement Award means an award (A) that vests or is earned based solely on the passage of time and has a value equal to the Change of Control Value, (B) that relates to U.S. publicly traded equity securities of the Successor Company in the Change of Control, (C) the tax consequences of which for such Participant under the Code, if the Participant is subject to U.S. federal income tax under the Code, are not less favorable to the Participant than the tax consequences of the Replaced Award, and (D) the other terms and conditions of which are not less favorable to the Participant than the terms and conditions of the Replaced Award (including the provisions that would apply in the event of a subsequent change of control). A Replacement Award may be granted only to the extent it does not result in the Replaced Award or Replacement Award failing to comply with or ceasing to be exempt from Code Section 409A. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Replacement Award may take the form of a continuation of the Replaced Award if the requirements of the preceding two sentences are satisfied. The determination of whether the conditions of this paragraph are satisfied will be made in good faith by the Committee, as constituted immediately before the Change of Control, in its sole discretion. (b) If no Replacement Award is provided to the Participant to replace, continue or adjust the Participant s outstanding Performance Shares (the Replaced Award ), the Participant will be deemed to have earned, as of the Change of Control, a cash payment equal in value to the Change of Control Value. Such cash payment, when made, will be in full satisfaction of the Performance Shares to which such payment relates. Such earned cash payment shall be paid to the Participant on the date of the Change of Control; provided, however, that if such Change of Control would not qualify as a permissible date of distribution under Code Section 409(a)(2)(A)(v), and the regulations thereunder, and where Code Section 409A applies to such distribution, the Participant will receive such earned cash payment on the date that would have otherwise applied pursuant to this Agreement as though such Change of Control had not occurred. (c) If a Replacement Award is provided to the Participant to replace, continue or adjust the Replaced Award and the Participant continues employment with the Successor Company after the Change of Control through the end of the Performance Period, the 

 Replacement Award will be deemed earned at the end of the Performance Period. The settlement of the earned Replacement Award shall be made in the shares of stock provided for in such Replacement Award during the calendar year in which the Performance Period ends and in full satisfaction of such Replacement Award. (d) If a Replacement Award is provided to the Participant to replace, continue or adjust the Replaced Award and the Participant continues employment with the Successor Company after the Change of Control, but the Participant dies prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Replacement Award will be deemed earned as of the Participant s death. The settlement of the earned Replacement Award shall be made in the shares of stock provided for in such Replacement Award within 2-1/2 months following the Participant s date of death and in full satisfaction of such Replacement Award. (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if a Replacement Award is provided to the Participant to replace, continue or adjust the Replaced Award and (A) the Participant s employment with the Successor Company is terminated by the Participant for Good Reason or by the Successor Company other than for Cause, (B) the Participant terminates employment due to Normal Retirement or Early Retirement, or (C) the Participant s employment with the Successor Company is terminated due to Disability, in each case within a period of two years after the Change of Control but prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Replacement Award shall be deemed 100 earned at the end of the Performance Period. The Participant will be paid such earned Replacement Award in shares of stock provided for under such Replacement Award during the calendar year in which the Performance Period ends and in full satisfaction of such Replacement Award. For purposes of this Agreement, Good Reason means: (A) any material failure of the Successor Company to comply with and satisfy any of the terms of any employment or change in control (or similar) agreement between the Successor Company and the Participant pursuant to which the Participant provides services to the Successor Company; (B) any significant involuntary reduction of the authority, duties or responsibilities held by the Participant immediately prior to the Change of Control (and, for the avoidance of doubt, involuntary removal of the Participant from an officer position that the Participant holds immediately prior to the Change of Control will not, by itself, constitute a significant involuntary reduction of the authority, duties or responsibilities held by the Participant immediately prior to the Change of Control); (C) any material involuntary reduction in the aggregate remuneration of the Participant as in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control; or (D) requiring the Participant to become based at any office or location more than the minimum number of miles required by the Code for the Participant to claim a moving expense deduction, from the office or location at which the Participant was based immediately prior to such Change of Control, except for travel reasonably required in the performance of the Participant s responsibilities; provided, however, that no termination shall be deemed to be for Good Reason unless (x) the Participant provides the Successor Company with written notice setting forth the specific facts or circumstances constituting Good Reason within 90 days after the initial existence of the occurrence of such facts or circumstances, and (y) the 

 Successor Company has failed to cure such facts or circumstances within 30 days of its receipt of such written notice. (f) If a Replacement Award is provided, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any outstanding Performance Shares that, at the time of the Change of Control, are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) shall be deemed to be earned at the time of such Change of Control and shall be paid in accordance with Section 5(b) s payment timing provisions in shares of stock provided for in such Replacement Award in full satisfaction of such Replacement Award. 6. Payment of Taxes Upon Settlement . As a condition of the delivery of the payment under this Agreement, the Participant agrees that the Company shall withhold a sufficient number of shares of Stock or cash from such payment for any taxes required to be withheld by the Company under Federal, State or local law as a result of the settlement of the Performance Shares in an amount sufficient to satisfy the minimum amount of taxes that is required to be withheld. To the extent permitted under the Plan, the Committee may allow for additional withholding of taxes. 7. Beneficiary Designation . In the case of the Participant s death, settlement of the Participant s Performance Shares will be made to the Participant s designated beneficiary or, if no beneficiary is so designated, the Participant s surviving spouse (if married) or estate (if not married). 8. Non-Transferability of Performance Shares . The Performance Shares may not be assigned, transferred, pledged or hypothecated in any manner (otherwise than by will or the laws of descent or distribution) nor may the Participant enter into any transaction for the purpose of, or which has the effect of, reducing the market risk of holding the Performance Shares by using puts, calls or similar financial techniques. The Performance Shares subject to this Agreement may be settled during the lifetime of the Participant only with the Participant or the Participant s guardian or legal representative. Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of the Performance Shares or any related rights to the Performance Shares that is contrary to the provisions of this Agreement or the Plan, or upon the levy of any attachment or similar process upon the Performance Shares or such rights, the Performance Shares and such rights shall immediately become null and void. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon the Successors of the Participant. 9. Rights as Stockholder . The Participant, or his/her Successors, shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Performance Shares covered by this Agreement. 10. Forfeitures and Recoupment .

For purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes 

 the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant s behalf, to any brokerage firm and/or third-party administrator engaged by the Company to hold the shares of Stock and other amounts acquired pursuant to the Performance Shares to re-convey, transfer or otherwise return such shares of Stock and/or other amounts to the Company upon the Company s enforcement of the Policy. To the extent that this Agreement and the Policy conflict, the terms of the Policy shall prevail. Relevant sections of this Agreement shall be deemed superseded by and subject to the terms and conditions of the Policy from and after the effective date thereof. 11. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization . In the event of any change in corporate capitalization, corporate transaction, sale or other disposition of assets or similar corporate transaction or event involving the Company as described in Section 5.5 of the Plan, the Committee shall make equitable adjustment as it determines necessary and appropriate in the number of Performance Shares subject to this Agreement and in the other terms of these Performance Shares; provided, however, that no fractional share shall be issued upon subsequent settlement of the Performance Shares. 12.

No Right to Continued Employment . Nothing in this Agreement shall interfere with or affect the rights of the Company or the Participant under any employment agreement or confer upon the Participant any right to continued employment with the Company. 15.

Amendment . Any amendment to the Plan shall be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement to the extent that the amendment is applicable hereto. 18. Severability . If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision hereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to any other person or circumstances shall not be affected, and the provisions so held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal shall be reformed to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to make it enforceable, valid and legal. 19.

A Replacement Award may be granted only to the extent it does not result in the Replaced Award or Replacement Award failing to comply with or ceasing to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Replacement Award may take the form of a continuation of the Replaced Award if the requirements of the preceding two sentences are satisfied. The determination of whether the conditions of this Section 2(d)(ii) are satisfied will be made in good faith by the Committee, as constituted immediately before the Change of Control, in its sole discretion. 
 (iii) If a Replacement Award is provided, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any outstanding RSUs which at the time of the Change of Control are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) will be deemed to be Vested at the time of such Change of Control. 
 3. Settlement of RSUs . 
 (a) Normal . Subject to Section 3(b) , as soon as administratively practicable after the Vesting Date (but in no event more than thirty days after the Vesting Date), the Company will issue to the Director one share of Stock for each RSU that is a Vested RSU on such Vesting Date to the extent the RSU has not been previously forfeited or settled. 
 (b) Other Settlement Events . Notwithstanding Section 3(a) , to the extent the RSUs are Vested RSUs on the dates set forth below and to the extent the Vested RSUs have not previously been forfeited or settled, the Company will one share of Stock for each RSU that is a Vested RSU as follows: 
 (i) Death or Permanent Disability . If there are such Vested RSUs at the time of the Director s cessation of service due to death or permanent disability, within thirty days of the Director s Separation from Service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) as a result of such death or permanent disability, the Company will issue to the person entitled by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution to such Vested RSUs one share of Stock for each such Vested RSU. 
 (ii) Other than Death or Permanent Disability . If there are such Vested RSUs at the time of the Director s Separation from Service for any reason other than as set forth in Section 2(b) , within thirty days of the Director s Separation from Service, the Company will issue to the Director (or the Director s legal representative, if applicable) one share of Stock for each such Vested RSU. 
 (iii) Change of Control . If there are such Vested RSUs upon a Change of Control, the Director is entitled to receive payment for such Vested RSUs in the form of one share of Stock for each such Vested RSU on the date of the Change of Control; provided, however, that if such Change of Control would not qualify as a permissible date of distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(A) of the Code, and the regulations thereunder, and where Section 

 3 

409A of the Code applies to such distribution, the Director is entitled to receive the corresponding payment on the date that would have otherwise applied pursuant to this Section 3 as though such Change of Control had not occurred. 
 (c) Deferral of Settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary, a Director may elect to defer receipt of shares of Stock to be received pursuant to this Agreement pursuant to the Company s Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended from time to time, or any successor deferred compensation plan applicable to non-employee directors.

Such dividend equivalents (if any) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and shall be paid, in the aggregate rounded down to the nearest whole number, or forfeited in the same manner and at the same time as the RSUs to which the dividend equivalents were credited. 
 8. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization; Change in Control .
