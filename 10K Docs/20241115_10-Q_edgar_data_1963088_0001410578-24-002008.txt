 ended June 30, 2024 (the Transition Report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on October 16, 2024. Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview Our goal is to build a cutting-edge technology enabled financial services firm that would create a more efficient platform for trading, clearing, settlement and banking, with evolving and innovative financial products that focus on financial services firms. We are a fintech driven business-to-business platform that expects to power innovation in fintech, investing, underwriting and trading. We believe we are positioned to provide a modern, mission-critical suite of solutions to our clients, enabling them to reduce their transactions costs and compete more effectively in their businesses. Our target client base for our prime banking and prime brokerage services includes financial services firms, generally with annual revenues up to 1 billion, including brokerage firms, hedge funds, pension plans, and family offices that are not adequately served by today s larger correspondent clearing firms and banks. Through the acquisition of Wilson-Davis Co., Inc. Wilson-Davis ), a correspondent clearing company, and the anticipated merger with Commercial Bancorp, we expect to acquire the capabilities to provide specialized clearing and banking services to financial services firms, with an emphasis on global markets currently underserviced by larger vendors. Once properly integrated, anticipated synergies between Commercial Bancorp, if acquired, and Wilson-Davis are expected to allow for lower cost of capital, higher net interest margins, expanded product development and greater credit extension. In addition, we believe the acquisition of a proprietary trading platform with clearing and settlement capabilities that will be developed by Pacsquare, including the AtlasClear Platform, along with the software products and intellectual property assets acquired from Atlas FinTech and Atlas Financial Technologies Corp., are cutting-edge, flexible and scalable. Wilson-Davis Wilson-Davis is a self-clearing correspondent securities broker-dealer registered with the SEC, licensed in 50 states, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and is a member in good standing of FINRA. Wilson-Davis derives revenue principally from commissions charged on the liquidation of restricted and control microcap securities, vetting, and clearing service fees charged to introducing brokers for which Wilson-Davis clears transactions on a fully disclosed basis, and other financial service fees. Commissions are earned by executing transactions for customers. Vetting fee revenues are earned when Wilson-Davis vests stock the customers want to bring into their accounts. Clearing fees are earned by clearing transactions for Glendale Securities, as introducing broker on a fully disclosed basis, pursuant to a clearing agreement with Glendale Securities. Key Factors Impacting Wilson-Davis Business Wilson-Davis business and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by numerous factors and trends, which Wilson-Davis believes include those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors of the Transition Report. Some key factors impacting Wilson-Davis business include: Liquidity . As a clearing broker-dealer in the U.S., Wilson-Davis is subject to cash deposit requirements with clearing organizations, brokers, and banks that may be large in relation to its total liquid assets. Growth of Customer Base . Wilson-Davis growth requires continued use of its services by new customers. Expanding Wilson-Davis Relationship with Existing Customers . Wilson-Davis ability to expand its relationship with its existing customers will be an important contributor to its long-term growth. Market Trends . As financial markets grow and contract, Wilson-Davis customers behaviors are affected. Wilson-Davis revenue and profitability can be affected by general downturns in the securities markets, resulting from factors such as increased inflation, increased interest rates and other factors.

 ELOC Agreement On July 31, 2024, Tau Investment Partners LLC Tau and the Company entered into an at-the-market agreement (the ELOC Agreement ). Pursuant to the ELOC Agreement, Tau has committed to purchase, upon the terms thereof and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, up to 10 million of shares of Common Stock, at a price per share equal to 97 of the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock during a pricing period of three consecutive trading days following Tau s receipt of the applicable advance notice sent by the Company from time to time, over the course of 24 months from the date of the ELOC Agreement. Each advance may be up to the greater of 100,000 shares or 50 of the average daily volume traded of the shares during the 30 trading days immediately prior to the date the Company requests each advance. Tau is an underwriter within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has issued 2,475,000 shares under the ELOC for 441,524 of which 148,382 in cash was received. Going Concern In connection with AtlasClear Holdings assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 205 -40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, the liquidity of the Company raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through the twelve months following the issuance of the financial statements. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities as a result of this uncertainty. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. Contractual Obligations The Company holds several long-term debt obligations with outside vendors and investors, with loans maturing between 2025 and 2028 (see Note 9 and 14). Additionally, the Company leases office space under several operating leases. The Company has no capital lease obligations. Further, there are no other outstanding long-term liabilities contractually obligated by the Company. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Derivative Liabilities We account for derivative instruments as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the derivative instruments specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the derivative instruments are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the derivative instruments meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the derivative instruments are indexed to our own common stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while financial instruments are outstanding. For issued or modified derivatives that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the derivatives are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified derivatives that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the derivatives are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the derivatives are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations.
