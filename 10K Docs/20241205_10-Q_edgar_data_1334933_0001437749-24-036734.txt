million including cash and cash equivalents of million and purchased uranium inventories of million. We believe our existing cash resources and net proceeds of million received from the issuance of common stock under our at-the-market offering subsequent to October 31, 2024, and if necessary, cash generated from the sale of the Company s liquid assets, will provide sufficient funds to carry out our planned operations including uranium mining and our inventory purchase commitments for 12 months from the date that these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are issued, including a million cash acquisition of a portfolio of uranium projects from Rio Tinto America Inc. with closing expected to occur during the quarter ending January 31, 2025. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Company will replace approximately million in surety bonds securing future reclamation costs relating to the project. 
 
 Our continuation as a going concern for a period beyond those 12 months will be dependent upon our ability to achieve consistent positive cash flow from the sale of our uranium inventories and to obtain adequate additional financing, as our operations are capital intensive and future capital expenditures are expected to be substantial. Historically, we have been reliant primarily on equity financings from the sale of our common stock and on debt financings in order to fund our operations, and this reliance is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Our continued operations, including the recoverability of the carrying values of our assets, are dependent ultimately on our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow from our operations.

 This MD A is focused on material changes in our financial condition from July 31, 2024, our most recently completed year end, to October 31, 2024, and our results of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2024, and should be read in conjunction with Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as contained in our Form 10-K Annual Report for Fiscal 2024. 
 
 Business 
 
 We are engaged in uranium mining and related activities, including exploration, pre-extraction, extraction and processing, on uranium projects located in the United States, Canada and the Republic of Paraguay, as more fully described in our Form 10-K Annual Report for Fiscal 2024. 
 
 In August 2024, we restarted uranium extraction at our fully permitted, and past producing, Christensen Ranch Mine ISR operation in Wyoming. We expect the ramp-up phase will continue while new production areas are being constructed and completing in early 2025. At the same time, we have continued to advance our Roughrider and Burke Hollow Projects with resource expansions and development programs, respectively. 
 
 Uranium recovered from the Christensen Ranch Mine ISR Project will be processed at our Irigaray central processing plant CPP ). The Irigaray CPP is the hub central to our four fully permitted ISR projects located in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, including our Christensen Ranch Mine, Reno Creek, Moore Ranch and Ludeman p rojects. On October 16, 2024, we received approval from the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Uranium Recovery Program, to increase the licensed production capacity at the Irigaray CPP to 4.0 million pounds of U 3 O 8 annually. 
 
 In Texas, our fully-licensed and 100 owned Hobson Processing Facility forms the basis for our regional operating strategy in the State of Texas, specifically the South Texas Uranium Belt, where we utilize ISR mining. We utilize a hub-and-spoke strategy whereby the Hobson Processing Facility, which has a physical capacity to process uranium-loaded resins of up to a total of two million pounds of U 3 O 8 annually and is licensed to process up to four million pounds of U 3 O 8 annually, acts as the central processing site (the hub for our Palangana Mine, and future satellite uranium mining activities, such as our Burke Hollow and Goliad Projects, located within the South Texas Uranium Belt (the spokes ).

On September 20, 2024, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement with Rio Tinto America Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Seller ), pursuant to which we will acquire from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (the Shares of (i) Kennecott Uranium Company, a Delaware corporation KUC ), which is a joint venture participant of, and owns a 50 ownership interest in, the Green Mountain Mining Venture, an unincorporated Wyoming contractual joint venture GMMV ), and (ii) Wyoming Coal Resources Company, a Delaware corporation WCRC ), which is a joint participant of, and owns a 50 ownership interest in GMMV (collectively, the Acquisition ). KUC, WCRC and GMMV, collectively, own or hold the assets, rights and obligations comprised of: (i) the facilities, equipment, improvements and fixtures for the processing of uranium located in Sweetwater County, Wyoming, owned by KUC, WCRC and GMMV, and related facilities and impoundments; (ii) the Jackpot and Big Eagle properties located in Wyoming; (iii) the mineral and real property interests which are owned or leased by KUC, WCRC or GMMV, subject to the permitted encumbrances, including patented and unpatented mining and millsite claims, leaseholds, material easements and rights-of-way of record; and (iv) the other rights and interests in uranium mineralization located in Fremont and Sweetwater Counties, Wyoming, owned or held by any of KUC, WCRC or GMMV (collectively, the Project ). The consideration for the Acquisition payable at closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement is 175 million in cash, subject to customary working capital adjustments as provided for in the Stock Purchase Agreement, with closing expected to occur during the quarter ending January 31, 2025. Upon completion of the Acquisition, we will replace approximately 25 million in surety bonds securing future reclamation costs relating to the Project. In addition, from and after the completion of the Acquisition we shall continue to indemnify the Seller from most of the liabilities associated with the Project. The closing of the Acquisition is subject to certain conditions customary for an Acquisition of this nature, including that the approval by the Wyoming Nuclear Regulator for the transfer of a Radioactive Materials License to us, which was issued on November 25, 2024. 
 
 On November 7, 2024, we filed an initial assessment technical report summary that includes an economic analysis and mineral resource estimate for our Roughrider Project, located in Northern Saskatchewan, Canada. The economic analysis is included in a technical report summary titled S-K 1300 Initial Assessment Report Roughrider Uranium Project, Saskatchewan, Canada , issued on November 5, 2024 and prepared for the Company by Tetra Tech Canada Inc., Understood Mineral Resources Ltd., Snowden Optiro, Terracon Geotechnique Ltd. and Clifton Engineering Group Inc., in accordance with Item 1302 of S-K 1300. 
 
 We also hold certain mineral rights in various stages in the States of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, and in Canada and in the Republic of Paraguay, many of which are located in historically successful mining areas and have been the subject of past exploration and pre-extraction activities by other mining companies. 
 
 Our operating and strategic framework is to become a leading low-cost North American focused uranium supplier based on expanding our uranium extraction activities, which includes advancing certain uranium projects with established mineralized materials towards uranium extraction and establishing additional mineralized materials on our existing uranium projects or through acquisition of additional uranium projects. 
 
 Key Issues 
 
 With the completion of the acquisition of Uranium One Americas, Inc. in December 2021 (the U1A Acquisition ), we expanded our footprints in Wyoming with our Wyoming hub-and-spoke operations. The acquisition of UEX Corporation ("UEX") in August 2022 and the acquisition of Roughrider Mineral Holdings Inc. in October 2022 further expanded our footprints in Canada and, in particular, the Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan. In the meantime, we continue to establish additional uranium mines through exploration and pre-extraction activities and direct acquisitions in both the U.S. and Paraguay, all of which require us to manage numerous challenges, risks and uncertainties inherent in our business and operations as more fully described in Item 1A. Risk Factors herein. 
 
 Our operations are capital intensive, and we will require significant additional financing to continue with our exploration, pre-extraction and extraction activities and acquire additional uranium projects. Historically, we have been reliant primarily on equity financings from the sale of our common stock to fund our operations. We have also relied on cash flows generated from the sales of our purchased uranium inventories under our physical uranium program to fund our operations. However, we have yet to achieve consistent profitability or develop consistent positive cash flow from operations. Our reliance on equity financings is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and their availability whenever such additional financing is required will be dependent on many factors beyond our control including, but not limited to, the market price of uranium, the continuing public support of nuclear power as a viable source of electricity generation, the volatility in the global financial markets affecting our stock price and the status of the worldwide economy, any one of which may cause significant challenges in our ability to access additional financing, including access to the equity and credit markets. We may also be required to seek other forms of financing, such as asset divestitures or additional joint venture arrangements, to continue advancing our uranium projects which would depend entirely on finding a suitable third party willing to enter into such an arrangement, typically involving an assignment of a percentage interest in the mineral project. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in securing any form of additional financing when required and on terms favorable to us. Our inability to obtain additional financing would have a negative impact on our operations, including delays, curtailment or abandonment of any one or all of our uranium projects. 
 
 We have not established proven or probable reserves through the completion of a final or bankable feasibility study for any of the mineral projects we operate. We have established the existence of mineralized materials for certain uranium projects, including our ISR Mines. Since we commenced uranium extraction at our ISR Mines without having established proven or probable reserves, there may be greater inherent uncertainty as to whether or not any mineralized material can be economically extracted as originally planned and anticipated. 
 
 The economic viability of our mining activities, including the expected duration and profitability of our ISR Mines, of any future satellite ISR mines, such as our Burke Hollow, Goliad, Ludeman, Antelope and Charlie Projects, and of our traditional uranium mines in the Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada, has many risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant, prolonged decrease in the market price of uranium; (ii) difficulty in marketing and/or selling uranium concentrates; (iii) significantly higher than expected capital costs to construct a mine and/or processing plant; (iv) significantly higher than expected extraction costs; (v) significantly lower than expected uranium extraction; (vi) significant delays, reductions or stoppages of uranium extraction activities; and (vii) the introduction of significantly more stringent regulatory laws and regulations. Our mining activities may change as a result of any one or more of these risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that any ore body that we extract mineralized materials from will result in achieving and maintaining profitability and developing positive cash flow.

As at October 31, 2024, we had no uranium supply or off-take agreements in place. Future sales of U 3 O 8 are therefore expected to generally occur through the uranium spot market, with any fluctuations in the market price continuing to have a direct impact on our revenues and cash flows. 
 
 Physical Uranium Program 
 
 The Company is investing in building the next generation of low-cost uranium projects that will be competitive on a global basis and which will use the ISR mining process which is expected to reduce the impact on the environment as compared to conventional mining. Despite our focus on low cost ISR mining with its low capital requirements, we saw a unique opportunity to purchase drummed uranium at prevailing spot prices which are below most global industry mining costs. Hence, we established a physical uranium portfolio (the Physical Uranium Program and, as of October 31, 2024, we had 1,256,000 pounds of uranium and had entered into agreements to purchase 700,000 pounds of warehoused uranium from Fiscal 2025 to Fiscal 2026 at conversion facilities located in North America at a volume weighted average price of approximately 38.81 per pound. As of October 31, 2024, we were committed to sell 600,000 pounds of uranium inventory in the amount of 49.75 million for delivery between November 2024 to January 2025. Subsequent to October 31, 2024, we sold 500,000 pounds of uranium inventory for 41.40 million at a weighted average price of 82.80 per pound and we entered into contracts to purchase 300,000 pounds of uranium inventory in the amount of 23.43 million at a weighted average price of 78.08 per pound with delivery in December 2024. 
 
 Our Physical Uranium Program will support three objectives for our Company: (i) to bolster our balance sheet as uranium prices appreciate; (ii) to provide strategic inventory to support future marketing efforts with utilities that could compliment production and accelerate cash flows; and (iii) to increase the availability of our Texas and Wyoming production capacity for emerging U.S. origin specific opportunities which may command premium pricing due to the scarcity of domestic uranium. One such U.S. origin specific opportunity is the Company s plan to participate in supplying the Uranium Reserve, as outlined in the Nuclear Fuel Working Group report published by the U.S. Department of Energy DOE ). 
 
 Uranium Market Developments 
 
 The uranium market is currently being driven by a macro demand for more electricity generation, an unprecedented global push to decarbonize electrical grids and geopolitical situations, among other factors. New electricity demand projections outlined from the "US Data Center Power Outlook" report issued in July 2024 showed new data center demand growth ranging from 60 to 90 gigawatt GW between 2023 and 2030. There is a growing realization that the highly reliable, safe, baseload power nuclear energy provides should be a part of any clean energy platform. Governments around the globe are also pursuing strategies to increase energy independence for national security interests that dovetail well with nuclear power as a key component in their energy mix. In the U.S. the White House recently announced that the United States will aim to deploy 200 GW of net new nuclear energy capacity by 2050, at least tripling current U.S. capacity. The net new capacity gains are anticipated to come from multiple sources, including building new nuclear power plants, uprating existing reactors, and restarting reactors that have retired for economic reasons. 
 
 Over the past few years, global uranium market fundamentals have improved as the market began a transition from being an inventory driven to a production driven market. The spot market bottomed out in November 2016 at about 17.75 per pound U 3 O 8 , but has since shown appreciation, reaching 107.00 per pound U 3 O 8 on February 2, 2024. During the three months ended October 31, 2024, uranium prices averaged 81.13 per pound U 3 O 8 . As at October 31, 2024, the spot uranium price was 80.00 per pound U 3 O 8 , representing an approximate 7.3 increase from October 31, 2023 when the price was 74.55 per pound U 3 O 8 . The period from August 2024 through October 2024 was marked by continued spot price fluctuations between 85.00 and 78.00 per pound U 3 O 8 (all price information is sourced from UxC LLC Historical Ux Daily Prices). 
 
 Underinvestment in uranium mining operations over the past decade has been a major factor contributing to a structural deficit between global production and uranium requirements. Reduced production from existing uranium mines has also been a contributing factor with some large producers cutting back and/or unable to reach previously planned production levels. In 2025, the mid-case gap between production and requirements is projected to be more than 58 million pounds of U 3 O 8 , and by 2034 accumulates to a total above 355 million pounds of U 3 O 8 UxC 2024 Q3 Uranium Market Outlook ). For context, the U.S. utilities purchased 51.6 million pounds of U 3 O 8 in 2023 U.S. Energy Information Administration, June 6, 2024 - Uranium Marketing Annual Report ). The current gap is being filled with secondary market sources, including finite inventory that has been declining and is projected to decline further in coming years. Secondary supply is also likely to be further reduced with western enrichers reversing operations from underfeeding to overfeeding that requires more uranium to increase the production of enrichment services. As secondary supplies continue to diminish, and as existing mines deplete resources, new production will be needed to meet existing and future utility demand. The timeline for new mining projects can be 10 years or longer and will require prices high enough to stimulate new mining investments. 
 
 Since 2022, uranium supply has become more complicated due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with its State Atomic Energy Corporation, Rosatom, being a significant supplier of nuclear fuel around the globe. Economic sanctions, transportation restrictions and U.S. legislation banning the importation of Russian nuclear fuel is causing a fundamental change to the nuclear fuel markets. The situation has been compounded with a November 15, 2024 announcement from the Russian government stating they have placed temporary restrictions on the export of enriched uranium to the United States". Additionally, the 2023 coup in Niger, and the new government s demand for the U.S. and France to vacate the country, as well as the revocation of Canadian and French companies mining rights, operating permits and export capabilities, has underscored jurisdictional risk. Niger is the world's seventh largest producer and accounted for about 5 of global uranium production and about 14 of European Union supply in 2023 Euratom Supply Agency, World Nuclear Association - Uranium in Niger July 23, 2024, World Nuclear News ). As a result of the instability and assurance of supply risks, U.S. and European utilities are shifting more focus to production from areas of low geopolitical risk. 
 
 On the demand side of the equation, the global nuclear energy industry continues robust growth, with 69 new reactors connected to the grid in 2014 through October of 2024, and with another 66 reactors under construction. Thus far in 2024, four new reactors have been connected to the grid and two reactors have been permanently shut down International Atomic Energy Association Power Reactor Information System - November 14, 2024 ). Total nuclear generating capacity for the world s 439 operable reactors as of November 4, 2024, stands at 396 GWe World Nuclear Association ). At the COP29 United Nations Climate Change Conference, 6 more countries joined the pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050, bringing the total to 31 countries, further supporting additional growth for the nuclear industry and uranium demand.

In the U.S., H.R. 1042, The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act , was signed into law and went into effect on August 11, 2024 and extends through 2040. The legislation bans Russian uranium imports but allows a U.S. DOE waiver process through 2027 in the event no alternative viable source of low-enriched uranium LEU is available to: (i) sustain the continued operation of a nuclear reactor or a U.S. nuclear energy company; or (ii) importation of Russian LEU is determined to be in the national interest. However, the waiver process will be moot if Russia follows through on their recent announcement to suspend exports of enriched uranium to the U.S. In other U.S. legislation, The Nuclear Fuel Security Act NFSA was enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act in December of 2023 and was designed to help rebuild the domestic nuclear fuel cycle, including uranium production, conversion and enrichment. The passage of H.R. 1042 unlocks 3.4 billion in funding under the NFSA and will be used by the DOE to acquire LEU and High Assay Low Enriched Uranium HALEU for advanced reactors. Under this program DOE will acquire LEU and HALEU with priority given to domestic sources of produced uranium, conversion and enrichment. In combination, the passage of these bills will help rebuild and restore a robust domestic fuel cycle in the U.S. 
 
 Additional upside market pressure is also occurring as utilities continue their return to a longer-term contracting cycle to replace expiring contracts. Cumulative uncommitted demand through 2034 is more than 865 million pounds of U 3 O 8 UxC Uranium Market Overview Q3 2024 ). This utility demand, along with that from financial entities, government programs and various producers, as well as the increasing interest in nuclear energy for data centers, are adding to the strong fundamentals supporting the uranium market. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 The timing of our uranium concentrate sales is dependent upon factors such as extraction results from our mining activities, cash requirements, contractual requirements and perception of the uranium market. As a result, our sales are neither tied to nor dependent upon any particular season. In addition, our ability to extract and process uranium does not change on a seasonal basis. Over the past ten years uranium prices have tended to decline during the calendar third quarter before rebounding during the fourth quarter, but there does not appear to be a strong correlation.

During the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a gain on dilution of ownership interest in URC as a result of URC issuing more shares from its equity financing and exercises of warrants and/or stock options. As at October 31, 2024, we had a 14.4 equity interest in URC compared to a 14.8 equity interest as at July 31, 2024. 
 
 During the three months ended October 31, 2024, we recorded a share of URC s loss of 0.06 million (three months ended October 31, 2023: income of 1.32 million) and a share of JCU s loss of 0.42 million (three months ended October 31, 2023: 0.28 million). 
 
 Fair Value Gain (Loss) on Equity Securities 
 
 As at October 31, 2024, our investments in certain equity securities were revalued using the market values at period end, which resulted in a fair value loss of 10.35 million on revaluation of equity securities for the three months ended October 31, 2024 (three months ended October 31, 2023: gain of 17.31 million). 
 
 Gain (Loss) on Revaluation of Derivative Liabilities 
 
 In connection with the UEX Acquisition, we issued Replacement Warrants, which are accounted for as derivative liabilities as the exercise prices of the UEX warrants were denominated in Canadian dollars which differs from the functional currency of the Company. As at October 31, 2024, the Replacement Warrants that had not been exercised expired. A gain of 1.71 million on revaluation of derivative liabilities was recorded for the three months ended October 31, 2024 due to the decrease in time value of the Replacement Warrants as they expired in the quarter. During the three months ended October 31, 2023, we recorded a loss on revaluation of derivative liabilities of 6.90 million primarily due to changes in our share price.

Historically, we have been reliant primarily on equity financings from the sale of our common stock and on debt financing in order to fund our operations. We have yet to achieve consistent profitability or develop consistent positive cash flow from operations. Currently, we also rely on cash flows generated from the sales of our purchased uranium concentrates to fund our operations. Our reliance on equity is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and their availability whenever such additional financing is required will be dependent on many factors beyond our control and including, but not limited to, the market price of uranium, the continuing public support of nuclear power as a viable source of electricity generation, the volatility in the global financial markets affecting our stock price and the status of the worldwide economy, any one of which may cause significant challenges in our ability to access additional financing, including access to the equity and credit markets. We may also be required to seek other forms of financing, such as asset divestitures or joint venture arrangements, to continue advancing our uranium projects which would depend entirely on finding a suitable third party willing to enter into such an arrangement, typically involving an assignment of a percentage interest in the mineral project. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in securing any form of additional financing when required and on terms favorable to us. 
 
 Our operations are capital intensive and future capital expenditures are expected to be substantial. We will require significant additional financing to fund our operations, including continuing with our exploration, pre-extraction and extraction activities and acquiring additional uranium projects. In the absence of such additional financing, we would not be able to fund our operations, including continuing with our exploration, pre-extraction and extraction activities, which may result in delays, curtailment or abandonment of any one or all of our uranium projects. 
 
 We hold mineral rights in the States of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, in Canada and in the Republic of Paraguay, with annual land-related payments totaling 5.93 million to maintain these rights in good standing. 
 
 Our anticipated operations, including exploration, pre-extraction and extraction activities, however, will be dependent on and may change as a result of our financial position, the market price of uranium and other considerations, and such changes may include accelerating the pace or broadening the scope of reducing our operations. Our ability to secure adequate funding for these activities will be impacted by our operating performance, other uses of cash, the market price of uranium, the market price of our common stock and other factors which may be beyond our control. Specific examples of such factors include, but are not limited to: 

if the market price of uranium weakens; 

if the market price of our common stock weakens; and 

if a nuclear incident, such as the events that occurred in Japan in March 2011, were to occur, continuing public support of nuclear power as a viable source of electrical generation may be adversely affected, which may result in significant and adverse effects on both the nuclear and uranium industries. 

We believe our existing cash resources and net proceeds of 31.04 million received from the issuance of common stock under the ATM Offering subsequent to October 31, 2024, and if necessary, cash generated from the sale of the Company s liquid assets, will provide sufficient funds to carry out our planned operations for 12 months from the date that this Quarterly Report is issued. Our continuation as a going concern for a period beyond those 12 months will be dependent upon our ability to generate cash flow from the sales of our uranium inventories under our Physical Uranium Program and to obtain adequate additional financing, as our operations are capital intensive and future capital expenditures are expected to be substantial. 
 
 Our long-term success, including the recoverability of the carrying values of our assets and our ability to acquire additional uranium projects and continue with exploration, pre-extraction, extraction and mining activities on our existing uranium projects, will depend ultimately on our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow from our operations by establishing ore bodies that contain commercially recoverable uranium and to develop these into profitable mining activities. 
 
 Equity Financings 
 
 On November 16, 2022, we filed a Form S-3 automatic shelf registration statement under the Securities Act, which became effective upon filing, providing for the public offer and sale of certain securities of the Company from time to time, at our discretion, of an undetermined dollar value of common stock, debt securities, warrants to purchase common stock or debt securities, subscription receipts for and units which include common stock, debt securities, warrants or any combination thereof (the 2022 Shelf), which included an at-the-market offering agreement prospectus (the ATM Offering) covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to a maximum offering of 300 million under the 2022 Shelf. 
 
 On November 16, 2022, we also entered into an at-the-market offering agreement (the ATM Offering Agreement) with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC and certain co-managers (collectively, the ATM Manager) as set forth in the ATM Offering Agreement under which we may, from time to time, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 300 million through the ATM Managers selected by us.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). Based on this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information the Company is required to disclose in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act: (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (2) is accumulated and communicated to Company management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 It should be noted that any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions designed to obtain reasonable (not absolute) assurance as to its effectiveness, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our quarter ended October 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, other than as disclosed below, there are no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, to which our Company or any of our subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their property is subject, and no director, officer, affiliate or record or beneficial owner of more than 5 of our common stock, or any associate or any such director, officer, affiliate or security holder, is: (i) a party adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries in any legal proceeding; or (ii) has an adverse interest to us or any of our subsidiaries in any legal proceeding. Other than as disclosed below, management is not aware of any other material legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties. 
 
 On or about March 9, 2011, the TCEQ granted our Company s applications for a Class III Injection Well Permit, Permit Area Authorization and Aquifer Exemption AE for our Goliad Project. On or about December 4, 2012, the EPA concurred with the TCEQ issuance of the AE permit. With the receipt of this concurrence, the final authorization required for uranium extraction, our Goliad Project achieved fully-permitted status. On or about May 24, 2011, a group of petitioners, inclusive of Goliad County, appealed the TCEQ action to the 250 th District Court in Travis County, Texas. A motion filed by our Company to intervene in this matter was granted. The petitioners appeal lay dormant until on or about June 14, 2013, when the petitioners filed their initial brief in support of their position. On or about January 18, 2013, a different group of petitioners, exclusive of Goliad County, filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to appeal the EPA s decision. On or about March 5, 2013, a motion filed by our Company to intervene in this matter was granted. The parties attempted to resolve both appeals, to facilitate discussions and avoid further legal costs. The parties jointly agreed, through mediation initially conducted through the Fifth Circuit on or about August 8, 2013, to abate the proceedings in the State District Court. On or about August 21, 2013, the State District Court agreed to abate the proceedings. The EPA subsequently filed a motion to remand without vacatur with the Fifth Circuit wherein the EPA s stated purpose was to elicit additional public input and further explain its rationale for the approval. In requesting the remand without vacatur, which would allow the AE to remain in place during the review period, the EPA denied the existence of legal error and stated that it was unaware of any additional information that would merit reversal of the AE. We and the TCEQ filed a request to the Fifth Circuit for the motion to remand without vacatur, and if granted, to be limited to a 60-day review period. On December 9, 2013, by way of a procedural order from a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit, the Court granted the remand without vacatur and initially limited the review period to 60 days. In March of 2014, at the EPA s request, the Fifth Circuit extended the EPA s time period for review and additionally, during that same period, our Company conducted a joint groundwater survey of the site, the result of which reaffirmed our previously filed groundwater direction studies. On or about June 17, 2014, the EPA reaffirmed its earlier decision to uphold the granting of our existing AE, with the exception of a northwestern portion containing less than 10 of the uranium resource which was withdrawn, but not denied, from the AE area until additional information is provided in the normal course of mine development. On or about September 9, 2014, the petitioners filed a status report with the State District Court which included a request to remove the stay agreed to in August 2013 and to set a briefing schedule. In that Status Report the petitioners also stated that they had decided not to pursue their appeal at the Fifth Circuit. 
 
 A Class I renewal application for the Goliad Project disposal wells was received by the TCEQ on January 23, 2020 and declared administratively complete on April 27, 2020. The application went through technical review and, on September 13, 2022, the executive director of the TCEQ made a decision that the permit application met the requirements of the law. On or around October 4, 2022, petitioners in Goliad County requested a hearing and reconsideration on the renewal permits. The TCEQ considered the requests on December 14, 2022, during its open meeting, and denied the petitioner s request for reconsideration but granted its request for hearing. The TCEQ referred the application to the State Office of Administrative Hearing SOAH to discuss three issues: (i) whether the permit application adequately characterizes the geology and identified and assessed faults in the vicinity of the proposed injections wells; (ii) whether the draft permit provides for adequate monitoring of migration of injected fluids in the vicinity of the proposed injection wells: and (iii) whether the location and design of the injection wells and pre-injection facilities are adequate. Closing statements were submitted by all parties to the SOAH Administrative Law Judges ALJs on February 5, 2024. On April 10, 2024, the ALJs made a recommendation to remand the matter to the executive director of the TCEQ for further examination, stating the Company failed to meet its burden of proof. The executive director, via Executive Director s Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision PFD ), respectfully disagreed with the recommendation presented in the PFD to remand the application to the executive director for further consideration. The executive director commented that the ALJ s PFD improperly broaden the scope of the refereed contested case hearing; misapplied the application requirements in commission rule for providing geoscientific information; mischaracterized the position of the executive director; and prematurely imposed monitoring or corrective action requirements before the subject injection wells were drilled, constructed and tested. The TCEQ reissued the permits on August 28, 2024. A Motion for Rehearing was filed on November 21, 2024. No other information is available on the potential proceeding at this time. We continue to believe that the pending appeal is without merit and the Goliad Project remains fully permitted for uranium extraction. 
 
 The Company has had communications and filings with the MOPC, the mining regulator in Paraguay, whereby the MOPC is taking the position that certain concessions forming part of the Company s Yuty, Alto Parana and Colonel Oviedo Projects are not eligible for extension as to exploration or continuation to exploitation in their current stages. While we remain fully committed to our development path forward in Paraguay, we have filed certain applications and appeals in Paraguay to reverse the MOPC s position in order to protect the Company s continuing rights in those concessions.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to the information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2024, and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have identified the following material risks and uncertainties which reflect our outlook and conditions known to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report. These material risks and uncertainties should be carefully reviewed by our stockholders and any potential investors in evaluating the Company, our business and the market value of our common stock. Furthermore, any one of these material risks and uncertainties has the potential to cause actual results, performance, achievements or events to be materially different from any future results, performance, achievements or events implied, suggested or expressed by any forward-looking statements made by us or by persons acting on our behalf. Refer to Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2024. 
 
 There is no assurance that we will be successful in preventing the material adverse effects that any one or more of the following material risks and uncertainties may cause on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, which may result in a significant decrease in the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, there is no assurance that these material risks and uncertainties represent a complete list of the material risks and uncertainties facing us. There may be additional risks and uncertainties of a material nature that, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, we are unaware of or that we consider immaterial that may become material in the future, any one or more of which may result in a material adverse effect on us. You could lose all or a significant portion of your investment due to any one of these material risks and uncertainties. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Company and Business 
 
 Evaluating our future performance may be difficult since we have a limited financial and operating history, with significant negative operating cash flow and an accumulated deficit to date. Our long-term success will depend ultimately on our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and to develop positive cash flow from our mining activities. 
 
 As more fully described under Item 1, Business, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2024, we were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 16, 2003 and, since 2004, we have been primarily engaged in uranium mining and related activities, including exploration, pre-extraction, extraction and processing, on projects located in the United States, Canada and the Republic of Paraguay. In November 2010, we commenced uranium extraction for the first time at our Palangana Mine utilizing ISR methods and processed those materials at our Hobson Processing Facility into drums of U 3 O 8 . We also hold uranium projects in various stages of exploration and pre-extraction in the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, in Canada and the Republic of Paraguay. In August 2024, we restarted uranium extraction at our fully permitted, and past producing, Christensen Ranch Mine ISR operation in Wyoming. We expect the ramp-up phase will continue while new production areas are being constructed and completing in early 2025. 
 
 As more fully described under Liquidity and Capital Resources of Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations, herein, we have a history of significant negative cash flow and net losses, with an accumulated deficit balance of 339.06 million as of October 31, 2024. Historically, we have been reliant primarily on equity financings from the sale of our common stock and on debt financing in order to fund our operations. Although we generated revenues from sales of U 3 O 8 we extracted during Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 of 3.08 million, 9.03 million and 13.76 million, respectively, and generated revenues from sales of purchased uranium inventory totaling 17.09 million during the three months ended October 31, 2024 , we have yet to achieve consistent profitability or develop consistent positive cash flow from our operations, and we do not expect to achieve consistent profitability or develop consistent positive cash flow from operations in the near term. As a result of our limited financial and operating history, including our significant negative cash flow from operations and net losses to date, it may be difficult to evaluate our future performance. 
 
 As at October 31, 2024, we had working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of 248.49 million including cash and cash equivalents of 190.60 million and purchased uranium inventory holdings of 64.63 million. Subsequent to October 31, 2024, we received additional net cash proceeds of 31.04 million under our ATM Offering. We believe that our existing cash resources and, if necessary, cash generated from the sale of the Company s liquid assets, will provide sufficient funds to carry out our planned operations for 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report. Our continuation as a going concern for a period beyond those 12 months will be dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate additional financing, as our operations are capital intensive and future capital expenditures are expected to be substantial. Our continued operations, including the recoverability of the carrying values of our assets, are dependent ultimately on our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow from our operations. 
 
 Our reliance on equity and debt financings is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and their availability whenever such additional financing is required will be dependent on many factors beyond our control including, but not limited to, the market price of uranium, the continuing public support of nuclear power as a viable source of electrical generation, the volatility in the global financial markets affecting our stock price and the status of the worldwide economy, any one of which may cause significant challenges in our ability to access additional financing, including access to the equity and credit markets. We may also be required to seek other forms of financing, such as asset divestitures or joint venture arrangements, to continue advancing our projects which would depend entirely on finding a suitable third party willing to enter into such an arrangement, typically involving an assignment of a percentage interest in the mineral project.

Our long-term success, including the recoverability of the carrying values of our assets and our ability to acquire additional uranium projects and continue with exploration and pre-extraction activities and mining activities on our existing uranium projects, will depend ultimately on our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow from our operations by establishing ore bodies that contain commercially recoverable uranium and to develop these into profitable mining activities. The economic viability of our mining activities, including the expected duration and profitability of our ISR Mines and of any future satellite ISR mines, such as our Burke Hollow and Goliad Projects located within the South Texas Uranium Belt, our Christensen Ranch Mine and Reno Creek Project located in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming, and our projects in Canada and in the Republic of Paraguay, have many risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant, prolonged decrease in the market price of uranium; (ii) difficulty in marketing and/or selling uranium concentrates; (iii) significantly higher than expected capital costs to construct a mine and/or processing plant; (iv) significantly higher than expected extraction costs; (v) significantly lower than expected mineral extraction; (vi) significant delays, reductions or stoppages of uranium extraction activities; and (vii) the introduction of significantly more stringent regulatory laws and regulations. Our mining activities may change as a result of any one or more of these risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that any ore body that we extract mineralized materials from will result in achieving and maintaining profitability and developing positive cash flow. 
 
 Our operations are capital intensive and we will require significant additional financing to acquire additional mineral projects and continue with our exploration, pre-extraction and extraction activities on our existing projects. 
 
 Our operations are capital intensive and future capital expenditures are expected to be substantial. We will require significant additional financing to fund our operations, including acquiring additional mineral projects and continuing with our exploration, pre-extraction and extraction activities which include assaying, drilling, geological and geochemical analysis and mine construction costs. In the absence of such additional financing we would not be able to fund our operations or continue with our exploration and pre-extraction activities, which may result in delays, curtailment or abandonment of any one or all of our projects. 
 
 Our uranium extraction and sales history is limited. Our ability to generate revenue is subject to a number of factors, any one or more of which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results . 
 
 We have a limited history of uranium extraction and generating revenue. In November 2010, we commenced uranium extraction at our Palangana Mine, which has been our sole source of revenues from the sales of produced U 3 O 8 during Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012, with no revenues from sales of produced U 3 O 8 during the three months ended October 31, 2024, or any other fiscal years. In August 2024, we restarted uranium extraction at our fully permitted, and past producing, Christensen Ranch Mine ISR operation in Wyoming. We expect the ramp-up phase will continue while new production areas are being constructed and completing in early 2025. 
 
 During the three months ended October 31, 2024, we continued to remain in a state of operational readiness at our ISR Mines. This strategy has included the deferral of major pre-extraction expenditures and remaining in a state of operational readiness in anticipation of a recovery in uranium prices. Our ability to generate revenue from our Palangana and recently acquired Christensen Ranch Mines is subject to a number of factors which include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant, prolonged decrease in the market price of uranium; (ii) difficulty in marketing and/or selling uranium concentrates; (iii) significantly higher than expected extraction costs; (iv) significantly lower than expected uranium extraction; (v) significant delays, reductions or stoppages of uranium extraction activities; and (vi) the introduction of significantly more stringent regulatory laws and regulations. Furthermore, continued mining activities at our ISR Mines will eventually deplete the mines or cause such activities to become uneconomical, and if we are unable to directly acquire or develop existing uranium projects, such as our Moore Ranch, Reno Creek, Burke Hollow and Goliad Projects, into additional uranium mines from which we can commence uranium extraction, it will negatively impact our ability to generate revenues. Any one or more of these occurrences may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 
 
 Exploration, pre-extraction and extraction programs and mining activities are inherently subject to numerous significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ significantly from expectations or anticipated amounts. Furthermore, exploration programs conducted on our projects may not result in the establishment of ore bodies that contain commercially recoverable uranium. 
 
 Exploration, pre-extraction and extraction programs and mining activities are inherently subject to numerous significant risks and uncertainties, with many beyond our control and including, but not limited to: (i) unanticipated ground and water conditions and adverse claims to water rights; (ii) unusual or unexpected geological formations; (iii) metallurgical and other processing problems; (iv) the occurrence of unusual weather or operating conditions and other force majeure events; (v) lower than expected ore grades; (vi) industrial accidents; (vii) delays in the receipt of or failure to receive necessary government permits; (viii) delays in transportation; (ix) availability of contractors and labor; (x) government permit restrictions and regulation restrictions; (xi) unavailability of materials and equipment; and (xii) the failure of equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations. These risks and uncertainties could result in: (i) delays, reductions or stoppages in our mining activities; (ii) increased capital and/or extraction costs; (iii) damage to, or destruction of, our mineral projects, extraction facilities or other properties; (iv) personal injuries; (v) environmental damage; (vi) monetary losses; and (vii) legal claims.

Success in mineral exploration is dependent on many factors including, without limitation, the experience and capabilities of a company s management, the availability of geological expertise and the availability of sufficient funds to conduct the exploration program. Even if an exploration program is successful and commercially recoverable material is established, it may take a number of years from the initial phases of drilling and identification of the mineralization until extraction is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of extraction may change such that the material ceases to be economically recoverable. Exploration is frequently non-productive due, for example, to poor exploration results or the inability to establish ore bodies that contain commercially recoverable material, in which case the project may be abandoned and written-off. Furthermore, we will not be able to benefit from our exploration efforts and recover the expenditures that we incur on our exploration programs if we do not establish ore bodies that contain commercially recoverable material and develop these projects into profitable mining activities, and there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so for any of our projects. 
 
 Whether an ore body contains commercially recoverable material depends on many factors including, without limitation: (i) the particular attributes, including material changes to those attributes, of the ore body such as size, grade, recovery rates and proximity to infrastructure; (ii) the market price of uranium, which may be volatile; and (iii) government regulations and regulatory requirements including, without limitation, those relating to environmental protection, permitting and land use, taxes, land tenure and transportation. 
 
 We have not established proven or probable reserves through the completion of a final or bankable feasibility study for any of our projects, including our ISR Mines. Furthermore, we have no plans to establish proven or probable reserves for any of our uranium projects for which we plan on utilizing ISR mining, such as our ISR Mines. Since we commenced extraction of mineralized materials from our ISR Mines without having established proven or probable reserves, it may result in our mining activities at our ISR Mines, and at any future projects for which proven or probable reserves are not established, being inherently riskier than other mining activities for which proven or probable reserves have been established. 
 
 We have established the existence of mineralized materials for certain of our projects, including our ISR Mines. We have not established proven or probable reserves, as defined by the SEC, through the completion of a final or bankable feasibility study for any of our projects, including our ISR Mines. Furthermore, we have no present plans to establish proven or probable reserves for any of our projects for which we plan on utilizing ISR mining. Since we commenced the extraction of mineralized materials at our ISR Mines without having established proven or probable reserves, there may be greater inherent uncertainty as to whether or not any mineralized material can be economically extracted as originally planned and anticipated. Any mineralized materials established or extracted from our ISR Mines should not in any way be associated with having established or produced from proven or probable reserves. 
 
 We prepare estimates of future uranium extraction and recovery, and there are no assurances that such estimates will be achieved. 
 
 We may from time to time prepare estimates of future uranium extraction and recovery, or increases in uranium extraction and recovery, for particular operations, or relating to our ability to increase uranium extraction and recovery in response to increases in commodity prices, as market conditions warrant or otherwise. No assurance can be given that any such extraction and recovery estimates will be achieved, nor can assurance be given that extraction or recovery increases will be achieved in a cost effective or timely manner. Failure to achieve extraction and recovery estimates or failure to achieve extraction and recovery in a cost effective or timely manner could have an adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition. These estimates are based on, among other things, the following factors: the accuracy of mineral resource estimates; the accuracy of assumptions regarding ground conditions and physical characteristics of mineralized materials, such as hardness and presence or absence of particular metallurgical characteristics; the accuracy of estimated rates and costs of extraction, recovery and processing; assumptions as to future commodity prices; assumptions relating to changes in laws, regulations or policies, or lack thereof, that could impact the cost and time required to obtain regulatory approvals, licenses and permits; assumptions relating to obtaining required licenses and permits in a timely manner, including the time required to satisfy environmental analyses, consultations and public input processes; assumptions relating to challenges to or delays in the licensing and permitting process; and assumptions regarding any appeals or lack thereof, or injunctions or lack thereof, relating to any approvals, licenses or permits. 
 
 Our actual uranium extraction and recovery may vary from estimates for a variety of reasons, including, among others: actual mineralized material extracted, mined or recovered varying from estimates of grade, tonnage, dilution, metallurgical and other characteristics; short-term operating factors relating to the mineral resources, such as the need for sequential construction or development of mineralized materials or deposits and the processing of new or different mineral grades; risk and hazards associated with extraction, mining and recovery; natural phenomena, such as inclement weather conditions, underground floods, earthquakes, pit wall failures and cave-ins; unexpected labor shortages or strikes; varying conditions in the commodities markets; and delays in obtaining or denial, challenges or appeals of regulatory approvals, licenses and permits or renewals of existing approvals, licenses or permits. 
 
 Since we are in the Exploration Stage, pre-production expenditures including those related to pre-extraction activities are expensed as incurred, the effects of which may result in our consolidated financial statements not being directly comparable to the financial statements of companies in the Production Stage. 
 
 Despite the fact that we commenced uranium extraction at our ISR Mines, we remain in the Exploration Stage (as defined by the SEC) and will continue to remain in the Exploration Stage until such time as proven or probable reserves have been established, which may never occur. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP under which acquisition costs of mineral rights are initially capitalized as incurred while pre-production expenditures are expensed as incurred until such time as we exit the Exploration Stage. Expenditures relating to exploration activities are expensed as incurred and expenditures relating to pre-extraction activities are expensed as incurred until such time as proven or probable reserves are established for that uranium project, after which subsequent expenditures relating to mine development activities for that particular project are capitalized as incurred.

We have neither established nor have any present plans to establish proven or probable reserves for our uranium projects for which we plan on utilizing ISR mining. Companies in the Production Stage (as defined by the SEC), having established proven and probable reserves and exited the Exploration Stage, typically capitalize expenditures relating to ongoing development activities, with corresponding depletion calculated over proven and probable reserves using the units-of-production method and allocated to inventory and, as that inventory is sold, to cost of goods sold. As we are in the Exploration Stage, it has resulted in us reporting larger losses than if we had been in the Production Stage due to the expensing, instead of capitalization, of expenditures relating to ongoing processing facility and mine pre-extraction activities. Additionally, there would be no corresponding amortization allocated to our future reporting periods since those costs would have been expensed previously, resulting in both lower inventory costs and cost of goods sold and results of operations with higher gross profits and lower losses than if we would have been in the Production Stage. Any capitalized costs, such as acquisition costs of mineral rights, are depleted over the estimated extraction life using the straight-line method. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be directly comparable to the financial statements of companies in the Production Stage. 
 
 Our mineral resource estimates may not be reliable and are inherently more uncertain than estimates of proven and probable reserves; there is risk and increased uncertainty to commencing and conducting production without established mineral reserves. 
 
 Our properties do not contain mineral reserves as defined under S-K 1300. Until mineral reserves or mineral resources are mined and processed, the quantity of mineral resources and grades must be considered as estimates only and may be inaccurate. We have established the existence of uranium resources for certain uranium projects, including at our Palangana Mine, Christensen Ranch Mine, Roughrider Project and Christie Lake Project. We have not established proven or probable reserves, as defined under S-K 1300, through the completion of a feasibility study, for any of our uranium projects, including the Palangana Mine, Christensen Ranch Mine, Roughrider Project and Christie Lake Project. Furthermore, we currently have no plans to establish proven or probable reserves for any of our uranium projects for which we utilize ISR methods, such as the Palangana Mine and Christensen Ranch Mine. As a result, and despite the fact that we have previously produced U 3 O 8 at the Palangana Mine, there is increased uncertainty and risk that may result in economic and technical failure which may adversely impact our future profitability. 
 
 There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of mineral resources, including many factors beyond our control, and no assurance can be given that the recovery of mineral resources will be realized. In general, estimates of mineral resources are based upon several factors and assumptions made as of the date on which the estimates were determined, including (i) geological and engineering estimates that have inherent uncertainties and the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; (ii) the judgment of the geologists, engineers and other professionals preparing the estimate; (iii) estimates of future uranium prices and operating costs; (iv) the quality and quantity of available data and the interpretation of that data; and (v) the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results. 
 
 All estimates are, to some degree, uncertain; with in situ recovery, this is due in part to limited sampling information collected prior to mining. For these reasons, estimates of the recoverable mineral resources prepared by different professionals or by the same professionals at different times, may vary substantially. As such, there is significant uncertainty in any mineral resource estimate and actual deposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may differ materially from our estimates. 
 
 Estimated costs of future reclamation obligations may be significantly exceeded by actual costs incurred in the future. Furthermore, only a portion of the financial assurance required for the future reclamation obligations has been funded. 
 
 We are responsible for certain remediation and decommissioning activities in the future, primarily for our Hobson and Irigaray Processing Facilities, our ISR Mines and our recently acquired Roughrider Project, and have recorded a liability of 19.88 million on our balance sheet at October 31, 2024, to recognize the present value of the estimated costs of such reclamation obligations. Should the actual costs to fulfill these future reclamation obligations materially exceed these estimated costs, it may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results, including not having the financial resources required to fulfill such obligations when required to do so. 
 
 As at October 31, 2024, the total estimated reclamation costs for all of our projects was 29.03 million. We have secured 27.25 million of surety bonds as an alternate source of financial assurance for the estimated costs of the reclamation obligations, of which 7.25 million is funded and held as restricted cash for collateral purposes as required by the surety. We may be required at any time to fund the remaining 21.78 million or any portion thereof for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, the following: (i) the terms of the surety bonds are amended, such as an increase in collateral requirements; (ii) we are in default with the terms of the surety bonds; (iii) the surety bonds are no longer acceptable as an alternate source of financial assurance by the regulatory authorities; or (iv) the surety encounters financial difficulties. Should any one or more of these events occur in the future, we may not have the financial resources to fund the remaining amount or any portion thereof when required to do so. 
 
 We cannot provide any assurance that our Physical Uranium Program involving the strategic acquisition of physical uranium will be successful, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 We have used or allocated a large portion of our cash on hand in order to fund the acquisition of drummed uranium under our Physical Uranium Program. This strategy will be subject to a number of risks and there is no assurance that the strategy will be successful. Future deliveries are subject to performance by other parties and there is a possibility of default by those parties, thus depriving us of potential benefits. 
 
 Due to the fluctuation of uranium prices, the price of uranium will fluctuate and we will be subject to losses should we ultimately determine to sell the uranium at prices lower than the acquisition cost. The primary risks associated with physical uranium will be the normal risks associated with supply and demand fundamentals affecting price movements. 
 
 We may be required to sell a portion or all of the physical uranium accumulated to fund our operations should other forms of financing not be available to meet our capital requirements. 
 
 Since there is no public market for uranium, selling the uranium may take extended periods of time and suitable purchasers may be difficult to find, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on our securities. 
 
 There is no public market for the sale of uranium, although there are several trading and brokerage houses that serve the industry with bid and ask data as well as locations and quantities. The uranium futures market on the New York Mercantile Exchange does not provide for physical delivery of uranium, only cash on settlement, and that trading forum does not offer a formal market but rather facilitates the introduction of buyers to sellers.

Table of Contents 

The pool of potential purchasers and sellers is limited, and each transaction may require the negotiation of specific provisions. Accordingly, a sale may take several weeks or months to complete. If we determine to sell any physical uranium that we have acquired, we may likewise experience difficulties in finding purchasers that are able to accept a material quantity of physical uranium at a price and at a location that is compatible with our interests. The inability to sell on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and at a desired price and location could have a material adverse effect on our securities. 
 
 As part of our Physical Uranium Program, we have entered into commitments to purchase U 3 O 8 and may purchase additional quantities. There is no certainty that any future purchases contemplated by us will be completed. 
 
 Storage arrangements, including the extension of storage arrangements, along with credit and operational risks of uranium storage facilities, may result in the loss or damage of our physical uranium which may not be covered by insurance or indemnity provisions and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 

Currently, the uranium we purchase is or will be stored at the licensed uranium conversion facilities of ConverDyn, located in Metropolis, Illinois, owned by Honeywell, and at Cameco Corporation s facilities, located in Ontario, Canada. There can be no assurance that storage arrangements that have been negotiated will be extended indefinitely, forcing actions or costs not currently contemplated. Failure to negotiate commercially reasonable storage terms for a subsequent storage period with ConverDyn may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

By holding our uranium inventory at the ConverDyn conversion facility we are exposed to the credit and operational risks of the facility. There is no guarantee that we can fully recover all of our investment in uranium held with the facility in the event of a disruptive event. Failure to recover all uranium holdings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any loss or damage of the uranium may not be fully covered or absolved by contractual arrangements with ConverDyn or our insurance arrangements, and we may be financially and legally responsible for losses and/or damages not covered by indemnity provisions or insurance. Such responsibility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 
 We do not insure against all of the risks we face in our operations. 
 
 In general, where coverage is available and not prohibitively expensive relative to the perceived risk, we will maintain insurance against such risk, subject to exclusions and limitations. We currently maintain insurance against certain risks, including securities and general commercial liability claims and certain physical assets used in our operations, subject to exclusions and limitations, however, we do not maintain insurance to cover all of the potential risks and hazards associated with our operations. We may be subject to liability for environmental, pollution or other hazards associated with our exploration, pre-extraction and extraction activities, which we may not be insured against, which may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or which we may elect not to insure against because of high premiums or other reasons. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that any insurance coverage we currently have will continue to be available at reasonable premiums or that such insurance will adequately cover any resulting liability. 
 
 Acquisitions that we may make from time to time could have an adverse impact on us. 
 
 From time to time we examine opportunities to acquire additional mining assets and businesses. Any acquisition that we may choose to complete may be of a significant size, may change the scale of our business and operations and may expose us to new geographic, political, operating, financial and geological risks. Our success in our acquisition activities depends on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition and integrate the acquired operations successfully with those of our Company. Any acquisitions would be accompanied by risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example: (i) there may be a significant change in commodity prices after we have committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio; (ii) a material ore body may prove to be below expectations; (iii) we may have difficulty integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization; (iv) the integration of the acquired business or assets may disrupt our ongoing business and our relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and contractors; and (v) the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant. In the event that we choose to raise debt capital to finance any such acquisition, our leverage will be increased. If we choose to use equity as consideration for such acquisition, existing shareholders may suffer dilution. Alternatively, we may choose to finance any such acquisition with our existing resources. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions. 
 
 We may not be able to obtain, maintain or amend rights, authorizations, licenses, permits or consents required for our operations. 
 
 Our exploration and mining activities are dependent upon the grant of appropriate rights, authorizations, licences, permits and consents, as well as continuation and amendment of these rights, authorizations, licences, permits and consents already granted, which may be granted for a defined period of time, or may not be granted or may be withdrawn or made subject to limitations. There can be no assurance that all necessary rights, authorizations, licences, permits and consents will be granted to us, or that authorizations, licences, permits and consents already granted will not be withdrawn or made subject to limitations. 
 
 The marketability of uranium concentrates will be affected by numerous factors beyond our control which may result in our inability to receive an adequate return on our invested capital. 
 
 The marketability of uranium concentrates extracted by us will be affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include: (i) macroeconomic factors; (ii) fluctuations in the market price of uranium; (iii) governmental regulations; (iv) land tenure and use; (v) regulations concerning the importing and exporting of uranium; and (vi) environmental protection regulations. The future effects of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but any one or a combination of these factors may result in our inability to receive an adequate return on our invested capital.

We hold mineral rights in foreign jurisdictions which could be subject to additional risks due to political, taxation, economic and cultural factors. 
 
 We hold certain mineral rights located in the Republic of Paraguay through Piedra Rica Mining S.A., Transandes Paraguay S.A., Trier S.A. and Metalicos Y No Metalicos Paraguay S.R.L., which are incorporated in Paraguay. Operations in foreign jurisdictions outside of the United States and Canada, especially in developing countries, may be subject to additional risks as they may have different political, regulatory, taxation, economic and cultural environments that may adversely affect the value or continued viability of our rights. These additional risks include, but are not limited to: (i) changes in governments or senior government officials; (ii) changes to existing laws or policies on foreign investments, environmental protection, mining and ownership of mineral interests; (iii) renegotiation, cancellation, expropriation and nationalization of existing permits or contracts; (iv) foreign currency controls and fluctuations; and (v) civil disturbances, terrorism and war. 
 
 In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations in Paraguay, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the United States or Canada. We may also be hindered or prevented from enforcing our rights with respect to a government entity or instrumentality because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Any adverse or arbitrary decision of a foreign court may have a material and adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The title to our mineral property interests may be challenged. 
 
 Although we have taken reasonable measures to ensure proper title to our interests in mineral properties and other assets, there is no guarantee that the title to any of such interests will not be challenged. No assurance can be given that we will be able to secure the grant or the renewal of existing mineral rights and tenures on terms satisfactory to us, or that governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate will not revoke or significantly alter such rights or tenures or that such rights or tenures will not be challenged or impugned by third parties, including local governments, aboriginal peoples or other claimants. The Company has had communications and filings with the MOPC, whereby the MOPC is taking the position that certain concessions forming part of the Company s Yuty, Alto Parana and Colonel Oviedo Projects are not eligible for extension as to exploration or continuation to exploitation in their current stages. While we remain fully committed to our development path forward in Paraguay, we have filed certain applications and appeals in Paraguay to reverse the MOPC s position in order to protect the Company s continuing rights in those concessions. Our mineral properties may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or claims, and title may be affected by, among other things, undetected defects. A successful challenge to the precise area and location of our claims could result in us being unable to operate on our properties as permitted or being unable to enforce our rights with respect to our properties. 
 
 Due to the nature of our business, we may be subject to legal proceedings which may divert management s time and attention from our business and result in substantial damage awards. 
 
 Due to the nature of our business, we may be subject to numerous regulatory investigations, securities claims, civil claims, lawsuits and other proceedings in the ordinary course of our business including those described under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, herein. The outcome of these lawsuits is uncertain and subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual costs to be incurred will depend upon many unknown factors. We may be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these suits, and we may not prevail. Defending against these and other lawsuits in the future may not only require us to incur significant legal fees and expenses, but may become time-consuming for us and detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. The results of any legal proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty due to the uncertainty inherent in litigation, the difficulty of predicting decisions of regulators, judges and juries and the possibility that decisions may be reversed on appeal. There can be no assurances that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or operating results. 
 
 We depend on certain key personnel, and our success will depend on our continued ability to retain and attract such qualified personnel. 
 
 Our success is dependent on the efforts, abilities and continued service of certain senior officers and key employees and consultants. A number of our key employees and consultants have significant experience in the uranium industry. A loss of service from any one of these individuals may adversely affect our operations, and we may have difficulty or may not be able to locate and hire a suitable replacement. 
 
 Certain directors and officers may be subject to conflicts of interest. 
 
 The majority of our directors and officers are involved in other business ventures including similar capacities with other private or publicly-traded companies. Such individuals may have significant responsibilities to these other business ventures, including consulting relationships, which may require significant amounts of their available time. Conflicts of interest may include decisions on how much time to devote to our business affairs and what business opportunities should be presented to us. Our Code of Conduct and Ethics provides for guidance on conflicts of interest. 
 
 The laws of the State of Nevada and our Articles of Incorporation may protect our directors and officers from certain types of lawsuits. 
 
 The laws of the State of Nevada provide that our directors and officers will not be liable to our Company or to our stockholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors and officers. Our Bylaws provide for broad indemnification powers to all persons against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law. These indemnification provisions may require us to use our limited assets to defend our directors and officers against claims, and may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our directors and officers caused by their negligence, poor judgment or other circumstances. 
 
 Several of our directors and officers are residents outside of the United States, and it may be difficult for stockholders to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against such directors or officers. 
 
 Several of our directors and officers are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of such persons assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process on such directors and officers, or enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against such directors and officers, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. Consequently, stockholders may be effectively prevented from pursuing remedies against such directors and officers under United States federal securities laws. In addition, stockholders may not be able to commence an action in a Canadian court predicated upon the civil liability provisions under United States federal securities laws. The foregoing risks also apply to those experts identified in this document that are not residents of the United States.

Disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed and operated, are designed to obtain reasonable, and not absolute, assurance as to its reliability and effectiveness. 

Management s evaluation on the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures is designed to ensure that information required for disclosure in our public filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis to our senior management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management s report on internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are properly authorized, assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use and transactions are properly recorded and reported. However, any system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, is based in part upon certain assumptions designed to obtain reasonable, and not absolute, assurance as to its reliability and effectiveness. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures in the future may result in our inability to continue meeting our reporting obligations in a timely manner, qualified audit opinions or restatements of our financial reports, any one of which may affect the market price for our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets.

Proposed and new legislation in the U.S. Congress, including changes in U.S. tax law, may adversely impact the Company and the value of shares of our common stock. 
 
 Changes to U.S. tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect the Company or holders of shares of our common stock. In recent years, many changes to U.S. federal income tax laws have been proposed and made, and additional changes to U.S. federal income tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future. 
 
 The U.S. Congress passed and is currently considering numerous items of legislation which may be enacted prospectively or with retroactive effect, and which legislation could adversely impact the Company s financial performance and the value of shares of our common stock. In particular, we understand that new legislation known as the Build Back Better Act has been passed by both houses of the U.S. Congress. The legislation includes, without limitation, new corporate minimum income taxes. We understand that the proposals would be effective for 2022 or later years. 
 
 In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was recently signed into law and includes provisions that will impact the U.S. federal income taxation of corporations. Among other items, this legislation includes provisions that will impose a minimum tax on the book income of certain large corporations and an excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases that would be imposed on the corporation repurchasing such stock. It is unclear how this legislation will be implemented by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Company cannot predict how this legislation or any future changes in tax laws might affect the Company or purchasers of our common stock. 
 
 Mining, extraction, recovery, processing, construction, development and exploration activities depend, to a substantial degree, on adequate infrastructure. 
 
 Reliable roads, bridges, power sources and water supply are important determinants affecting capital and operating costs. We consider the existing infrastructure to be adequate to support our proposed operations and activities. However, unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, including drought, flooding, sabotage, government and/or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure could adversely affect our operations and activities, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Risks Related to our Industry 
 
 We are subject to the risks normally encountered by companies in the mineral extraction industry. 
 
 We are subject to the risks normally encountered by companies in the mineral extraction industry, such as: 

the discovery of unusual or unexpected geological formations; 

accidental fires, floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other natural disasters; 

unplanned power outages and water shortages; 

controlling water and other similar mining hazards; 

operating labor disruptions and labor disputes; 

the ability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor; 

our liability for potential pollution or other hazards; and 

other known and unknown risks involved in the conduct of exploration, development and operation of mines, extraction and recovery facilities and mills, along with the markets for uranium. 

The development of mineral properties is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: the cost of operations; variations in the grade of mineralized material; fluctuations in the minerals markets; costs of extraction and processing equipment; availability of equipment and labor; labor costs and possible labor strikes; government regulations, including without limitation, regulations relating to taxes, royalties, allowable extraction or production, and importing and exporting of minerals; government actions, including without limitation the establishment or expansion of mineral withdrawals, parks and monuments; land exchanges; foreign exchange; employment; worker safety; transportation; and environmental protection.

Mining operations involve a high degree of risk. 
 
 The exploration, construction, development, operation and other activities associated with mineral projects, along with the expansion of existing recovery operations and mining activities and restarting of projects, involve significant risks, including financial, technical and regulatory risks. The development or advancement of any of the exploration properties in which we have an interest is contingent upon obtaining satisfactory exploration results, project permitting and licensing and financing. The exploration, construction, development, operation and other activities associated with mineral projects involves significant financial risks over an extended period of time, which even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate. While discovery of a mine or other facility may result in substantial value, few properties that are staked and explored are ultimately developed into producing mines or extraction or recovery facilities. Major expenses may be required to establish mineral resources and mineral reserves by drilling and to finance, permit, license and construct extraction, mining, recovery and processing facilities. It is very difficult to ensure that the current or proposed exploration, permitting, construction and development programs on our mineral properties will result in profitable commercial extraction, mining or recovery operations. 
 
 Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, which include, among other things: the accuracy of mineral resource estimates; the particular attributes of the deposit, such as its size, geology, grade and accessibility; the ability to economically recover commercial quantities of the minerals; proximity to necessary infrastructure and availability of personnel; financing costs; governmental regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, reclamation bonds and royalties; the potential for litigation; land use; importing and exporting; and environmental and cultural protection, including but not limited to the governmental establishment of mineral withdrawals, parks and monuments and land exchanges. The construction, development, expansion and restarting of projects are also subject to: the successful completion of engineering studies with adequate results to proceed; the issuance of necessary governmental licenses and permits; the availability of adequate financing; engineering and construction timetables and capital costs being correctly estimated for our projects, including restarting projects on standby; and such construction timetables and capital costs not being affected by unforeseen circumstances, including but not limited to delays due to litigation/injunctions. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors, along with others, may result in our not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. 
 
 It is possible that actual costs and economic returns of current and new extraction, mining, or recovery operations may differ materially from our best estimates. It is not unusual in the mining industry for new mining operations and facilities to experience unexpected problems during the start-up phase, to take much longer than originally anticipated to bring them into a recovery or producing phase, to require more capital than anticipated, to operate at a higher cost than expected and/or to have reclamation liabilities that are higher than expected. 
 
 Major nuclear and global market incidents may have adverse effects on the nuclear and uranium industries. 
 
 The nuclear incident that occurred in Fukushima, Japan on March 11, 2011 had significant and adverse effects on both the nuclear and uranium industries. If another nuclear incident were to occur, it may have further adverse effects for both industries. Public opinion of nuclear power as a source of electrical generation may be adversely affected, which may cause governments of certain countries to further increase regulation for the nuclear industry, reduce or abandon current reliance on nuclear power or reduce or abandon existing plans for nuclear power expansion. Any one of these occurrences has the potential to reduce current and/or future demand for nuclear power, resulting in lower demand for uranium and lower market prices for uranium, adversely affecting the operations and prospects of our Company. Furthermore, the growth of the nuclear and uranium industries is dependent on continuing and growing public support of nuclear power as a viable source of electrical generation. 
 
 Nuclear energy competes with other sources of energy, including oil, natural gas, coal and hydroelectricity. These other energy sources are, to some extent, interchangeable with nuclear energy, particularly over the longer term. Technical advancements in, and government subsidies for, renewable and other alternate forms of energy, such as wind and solar power, could make these forms of energy more commercially viable and put additional pressure on the demand for uranium concentrates. Sustained lower prices of alternate forms of energy may result in lower demand for uranium concentrates.

Market projections for future demand for uranium are based on various assumptions regarding the rate of construction and approval of new nuclear power plants, as well as continued public acceptance of nuclear energy around the world. The rationale for adopting nuclear energy can be varied, but often includes the clean and environmentally friendly operation of nuclear power plants, as well as the affordability and round-the-clock reliability of nuclear power. A change in public sentiment regarding nuclear energy could have a material impact on the number of nuclear power plants under construction, planned or proposed, which could have a material impact on the market s and the Company s expectations for the future demand for uranium and the future price of uranium. 
 
 The Russia-Ukraine war has highlighted to many global policymakers the significant geopolitical risk associated with an over reliance on sources of energy from politically unstable jurisdictions. In many cases, this has resulted in increased calls for a renewed focus on energy independence, to which many nations have identified nuclear power as a potentially critical energy alternative that can both improve energy sovereignty and support the achievement of carbon emission reduction climate goals. 
 
 In March 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a black swan event impacting about 50 of the world s uranium production and has accelerated the market rebalancing. In 2020 significant production cuts were announced in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, including uranium facilities in Canada, Kazakhstan and Namibia. In 2024 most production impacted by COVID-19 has returned to an operating status. The Company also believes that a large degree of uncertainty exists in the market, primarily due to the size of mobile uranium inventories, transportation issues, premature reactor shutdowns in the U.S. and the length of time of any uranium mine, conversion or enrichment facility shutdowns. 
 
 The uranium industry is subject to numerous stringent laws, regulations and standards, including environmental protection laws and regulations. If any changes occur that would make these laws, regulations and standards more stringent, it may require capital outlays in excess of those anticipated or cause substantial delays, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 
 Uranium exploration, pre-extraction and extraction programs and mining activities are subject to numerous stringent laws, regulations and standards at the federal, state and local levels governing permitting, pre-extraction, extraction, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection and reclamation of the environment, protection of endangered and protected species, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. Our compliance with these requirements requires significant financial and personnel resources. 
 
 The laws, regulations, policies or current administrative practices of any government body, organization or regulatory agency in the U.S., or any other applicable jurisdiction, may change or be applied or interpreted in a manner which may also have a material adverse effect on our operations. The actions, policies or regulations, or changes thereto, of any government body or regulatory agency or special interest group may also have a material adverse effect on our operations. Uranium exploration, pre-extraction and extraction programs and mining activities are subject to stringent environmental protection laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations include permitting and reclamation requirements, regulate emissions, water storage and discharges and disposal of hazardous wastes. Uranium mining activities are also subject to laws and regulations which seek to maintain health and safety standards by regulating the design and use of mining methods. Various permits from governmental and regulatory bodies are required for mining to commence or continue, and no assurance can be provided that required permits will be received in a timely manner. Our compliance costs, including the posting of surety bonds associated with environmental protection laws and regulations and health and safety standards, have been significant to date, and are expected to increase in scale and scope as we expand our operations in the future. Furthermore, environmental protection laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future, and compliance with such changes may require capital outlays in excess of those anticipated or cause substantial delays, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 
 While the very heart of our business uranium extraction, which is the fuel for carbon-free, emission-free baseload nuclear power, helps address global climate change and reduces air pollution, the world s focus on addressing climate change will require the Company to continue to conduct all of its operations in a manner that minimizes the use of resources, including enhancing energy efficiency and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, in order to continue to minimize air emissions at our facilities, which can also increase mine and facility, construction, development and operating costs. Regulatory and environmental standards may also change over time to address global climate change, which could further increase these costs. To the best of our knowledge, our operations are in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable laws, regulations and standards. If we become subject to liability for any violations, we may not be able or may elect not to insure against such risk due to high insurance premiums or other reasons. Where coverage is available and not prohibitively expensive relative to the perceived risk, we will maintain insurance against such risk, subject to exclusions and limitations. However, we cannot provide any assurance that such insurance will continue to be available at reasonable premiums or that such insurance will be adequate to cover any resulting liability.

The uranium industry is subject to influential political and regulatory factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 
 
 The international uranium industry, including the supply of uranium concentrates, is relatively small, competitive and heavily regulated. Worldwide demand for uranium is directly tied to the demand for electricity produced by the nuclear power industry, which is also subject to extensive government regulation and policies. In addition, the international marketing and trade of uranium is subject to political changes in governmental policies, regulatory requirements and international trade restrictions (including trade agreements, customs, duties and/or taxes). International agreements, governmental policies and trade restrictions are beyond our control. Changes in regulatory requirements, customs, duties or taxes may affect the availability of uranium, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 
 
 The uranium industry is highly competitive and we may not be successful in acquiring additional projects. 
 
 The uranium industry is highly competitive, and our competition includes larger, more established companies with longer operating histories that not only explore for and produce uranium, but also market uranium and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. Due to their greater financial and technical resources, we may not be able to acquire additional uranium projects in a competitive bidding process involving such companies. Additionally, these larger companies have greater resources to continue with their operations during periods of depressed market conditions. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 
 Historically, the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to fluctuate significantly. 
 
 On September 28, 2007, our common stock commenced trading on the NYSE American (formerly known as the American Stock Exchange, the NYSE Amex Equities Exchange and the NYSE MKT) and prior to that, traded on the OTC Bulletin Board. 
 
 The global markets have experienced significant and increased volatility in the past, and have been impacted by the effects of mass sub-prime mortgage defaults and liquidity problems of the asset-backed commercial paper market, resulting in a number of large financial institutions requiring government bailouts or filing for bankruptcy. The effects of these past events and any similar events in the future may continue to or further affect the global markets, which may directly affect the market price of our common stock and our accessibility for additional financing. Although this volatility may be unrelated to specific company performance, it can have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares which, historically, has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. 
 
 In addition to the volatility associated with general economic trends and market conditions, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly due to the impact of any one or more events including, but not limited to, the following: (i) volatility in the uranium market; (ii) occurrence of a major nuclear incident such as the events in Japan in March 2011; (iii) changes in the outlook for the nuclear power and uranium industries; (iv) failure to meet market expectations on our exploration, pre-extraction or extraction activities, including abandonment of key uranium projects; (v) sales of a large number of our shares held by certain stockholders including institutions and insiders; (vi) downward revisions to previous estimates on us by analysts; (vii) removal from market indices; (viii) legal claims brought forth against us; and (ix) introduction of technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies.

A prolonged decline in the market price of our common stock could affect our ability to obtain additional financing which would adversely affect our operations. 
 
 Historically, we have relied on equity financing and debt financing as primary sources of financing. A prolonged decline in the market price of our common stock or a reduction in our accessibility to the global markets may result in our inability to secure additional financing which would have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 
 Additional issuances of our common stock may result in significant dilution to our existing shareholders and reduce the market value of their investment. 
 
 We are authorized to issue 750,000,000 shares of common stock of which 419,142,428 shares were issued and outstanding as of October 31, 2024. Future issuances for financings, mergers and acquisitions, exercise of stock options and share purchase warrants and for other reasons may result in significant dilution to and be issued at prices substantially below the price paid for our shares held by our existing stockholders. Significant dilution would reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power held by our existing stockholders and may result in a decrease in the market price of our shares. 
 
 We are subject to the Continued Listing Criteria of the NYSE American and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common stock . 
 
 Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain this listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer: (i) if in its opinion, the issuer s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; (ii) if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; (iii) if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; (iv) if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American s listing requirements; (v) if an issuer s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a low selling price and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the NYSE American; or (vi) if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable. 
 
 If the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures

During the quarter ended October 31, 2024, our ISR Mines were not subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration under the Mine Safety Act. 

Item 5. Other Information
