shares of common stock of Bio Lab to the LimitlessX shareholders (the Acquisition Closing ). According to the terms of the
Share Exchange Agreement, Bio Lab then issued an additional shares of common stock to the LimitlessX shareholders pro rata to
their interests approximately nine months from the Acquisition Closing as part of the LimitlessX Acquisition. Concurrently with the LimitlessX
Acquisition, Jaspreet Mathur, the founder and principal shareholder of LimitlessX, also purchased from Helion Holdings LLC, shares
of Bio Lab s Class A Preferred Convertible Stock, which at all times have a number of votes equal to of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock of Bio Lab. 

On
June 10, 2022, Bio Lab changed its name to Limitless X Holdings Inc. Limitless ). 

The
LimitlessX Acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger following the completion of the transaction. For accounting
purposes, LimitlessX was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the transaction was treated as a
recapitalization of Bio Lab. Accordingly, LimitlessX s assets, liabilities, and results of operations became the historical financial
statements of the registrant. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in this transaction. 

The
Company (as defined below) is a lifestyle brand, focused in the health and wellness industry. Initially, the Company focused on nutritional
supplements, wellness studies, and interactive training videos and has since focused its business on performance marketing, sales of
digital services, and sales of products. The Company s mission is to provide businesses a turnkey solution to sell their products.
Company teams include sales, marketing, user interface design (UI), user experience design (UX), fulfillment, customer support, labeling,
product manufacturing, consulting, retailing, and payment processing, among others. 

The
Company currently offers products online only. The Company has manufacturing and distribution licensing agreements to market, manufacture,
sell, and distribute branded products on behalf of its clients. The Company orders products from third party partner manufacturers that
make the products according to the Company s custom formulations, and brands them using the Company s licensed trademarks.
Products are then marketed and sold direct to consumers online. Orders are fulfilled and shipped directly from the Company s licensors.
The Company plans to offer global marketing services across all areas of the sales process, including market research, brand and product
development, and digital advertising operating as an integrated marketing agency. 

The
Company operates in the following product and service sectors: (i) health products and (ii) digital marketing services. The health products
sector included the sales of health products in two primary vertical markets: (1) health wellness; and (2) beauty skincare.

million and 
million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities of 
million the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. 

To
support our existing and planned business model, the Company needs to raise additional capital to fund our future operations. The Company
has not experienced any difficulty in raising funds through loans and has not experienced any liquidity problems in settling payables
in the normal course of business and repaying loans when they fall due. Successful renewal of our loans, however, is subject to numerous
risks and uncertainties. In addition, the increasingly competitive industry conditions under which we operate may negatively impacted
our results of operations and cash flows. Additional debt financing is anticipated to fund the Company s operations in near future.
However, there are no current agreements or understandings with regard to the form, time or amount of such financing and there is no
assurance that any of this financing can be obtained or that the Company can continue as a going concern.

their interests in approximately nine months from the Acquisition Closing as part of the Limitless Acquisition. Concurrently with the

Profit - Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.5 million compared to 0.4 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit of 0.1 million was primarily due to a shift in our marketing and selling strategies,
including a change in performance marketers and platforms. 

Operating
Expenses - During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 1.0 million in operating expenses compared to 1.6 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.6 million in operating expenses was primarily due to the decrease in
our advertising, marketing, and payroll expenses, as well as a decrease in transaction fees, merchant fees, and royalty fees. 

Our
 advertising and marketing expenses decreased by 0.1 million due to a shift in marketing strategies from relying on performance marketers
 and celebrity endorsements. 

The
 decrease in payroll due to reduction in headcounts of 0.5 million. 

The
 decrease in transaction fees and merchant fees are directly related to the decreased number of transactions during the nine months
 ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period prior year. 

Other
Income or Expense - During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had interest expense of 0.2 million compared to 0.3 million.
The decrease in interest expense was due to conversion of convertible debt to Preferred B Shares.

Product
Sales - Our product sales decreased by 10.9 million to 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to
 13.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In 2023, there was a shift in our marketing and selling strategies, including
a change in performance marketers and platforms, which resulted in the decrease of product sales. 

Cost
of Sales - Our cost of sales decreased from 7.2 million, or 51.6 of sales, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.8
million, or 26.4 of sales, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As operations decreased during the period, so did our costs
for freight, inventory, and other supplies. 

Gross
Profit - Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.2 million compared to 6.7 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit of 4.5 million was primarily due to a shift in our marketing and selling strategies,
including a change in performance marketers and platforms. 

Operating
Expenses - During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 4.2 million in operating expenses compared to 20.2 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 16.0 million in operating expenses was primarily due to the decrease in
our advertising, marketing, and payroll expenses, as well as a decrease in transaction fees, merchant fees, and royalty fees. 

Our
 advertising and marketing expenses decreased by 12.5 million due to a shift in marketing strategies from relying on performance marketers
 and celebrity endorsements. 

The
 decrease in payroll due to reduction in headcounts of 1.6 million 

The
 decrease in transaction fees and merchant fees are directly related to the decreased number of transactions during the nine months
 ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period prior year. 

Other
Income or Expense - During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had interest expense of 0.4 million compared to 0.9 million.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits
of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based
on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of the
material weakness described below, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Our
disclosure controls were not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are ineffective to provide reasonable assurance that
information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

The
material weakness, which relates to internal control over financial reporting, that was identified is: 

We
did not have sufficient personnel in our accounting and financial reporting functions. As a result, we were not able to achieve adequate
segregation of duties and were not able to provide for independent adequate reviewing of the financial statements. This control deficiency,
which is pervasive in nature, results in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Management
believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge with the non-routine or technical issues
we have encountered in the past will result in both proper recording of these transactions and a much more knowledgeable finance department
as a whole. Due to the fact that our accounting staff consists of a Chief Financial Officer, a bookkeeper, and external accounting consultants,
additional personnel will also ensure the proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional
personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support us if personnel turnover issues within the department occur. We believe
this will eliminate or greatly decrease any control and procedure issues we may encounter in the future. 

We
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial
reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as
necessary and as funds allow.
