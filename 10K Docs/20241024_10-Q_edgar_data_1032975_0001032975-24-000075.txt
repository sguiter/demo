Note 2 
 Shares used in net income per share computation: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic Effect of potentially dilutive equivalent shares Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted Net income per share: Basic Diluted 
 
 Share equivalents attributable to outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and employee share purchase plans totaling million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 
 10 

million and million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. A small number of performance-based restricted stock units were not included in the dilutive net income per share calculation because all necessary conditions had not been satisfied by the end of the respective period, and those shares were not issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the performance contingency period. 

Note 3 
 Marketing and selling Research and development General and administrative Total share-based compensation expense Income tax benefit ) ) ) ) Total share-based compensation expense, net of income tax benefit 
 
 The income tax benefit in the respective periods primarily consisted of tax benefits related to the share-based compensation expense for the period and direct tax benefit realized. 
 
 Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Defined Benefit Plans 
 
 Certain of the Company s subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans or non-retirement post-employment benefits covering substantially all of their employees. Benefits are provided based on employees years of service and earnings, or in accordance with applicable employee benefit regulations. The Company s practice is to fund amounts sufficient to meet the requirements set forth in the applicable employee benefit and tax regulations. The costs of million and million recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million recorded for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were primarily related to service costs.

million and million based on an effective income tax rate of and of pre-tax income, respectively. 
 
 The change in the effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the change in the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the favorable tax impacts from share-based compensation and unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertain tax positions. 
 
 The Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (the BEPS Project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the "OECD") recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, including a proposal to reallocate profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business Pillar One and establishing a minimum tax on global income Pillar Two ). Some jurisdictions, including Switzerland, where the Company operates are implementing Pillar Two laws to effectuate a minimum tax. The minimum tax effective beginning in fiscal year 2025 for the Company, is treated as a current cost and does not have a material impact on the Company's effective tax rate. The OECD and participating countries continue to issue underlying rules and administrative guidance related to Pillar Two, and the Company continues to monitor the relevant developments.

 Investments for Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 The marketable securities for the Company's deferred compensation plan were recorded at a fair value of million and million, as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, based on quoted market prices. Quoted market prices are observable inputs that are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Unrealized gains (losses) related to marketable securities for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not material and were included in other income (expense), net, and corresponding changes in the deferred compensation liability were included in operating expenses and cost of goods sold, in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Equity Method Investments 
 
 The Company has certain non-marketable investments included in other assets that are accounted for as equity method investments, with a carrying value of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Gains (losses) related to equity method investments for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not material and are included in other income (expense), net, in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. There was impairment of equity method investments during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 Financial Assets 
 
 The Company has certain equity investments without readily determinable fair values due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management's judgment. When certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, the Company revalues the investments using various assumptions, including the financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. The carrying value is also adjusted for observable price changes with the same or similar security from the same issuer. The amount of these equity investments without readily determinable fair value included in other assets was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The impairment charges related to these equity investments were material during the three and six

impairment charges related to these equity investments during the three and six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an impairment loss, before tax, of million as a result of the write-off of a note receivable which has been deemed no longer recoverable. This note receivable was previously obtained in conjunction with an exchange transaction related to the Company's investment in a privately held company. The impairment loss is included in other income (expense), net, in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Non-Financial Assets

 . Gains and losses in the fair value of the effective portion of the hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged inventory purchases are sold, at which time the gains or losses are reclassified to cost of goods sold. Cash flows from such hedges are classified as operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Hedging relationships are discontinued when the hedging contract is no longer eligible for hedge accounting, or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when the Company removes hedge designation for the contract. Gains and losses in the fair value of the effective portion of the discontinued hedges continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged inventory purchases are sold, unless it is probable that the forecasted inventory purchases will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter. 
 
 The notional amounts of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding related to forecasted inventory purchases were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The Company had million of net loss related to its cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of September 30, 2024, which will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.

 The Company presents the earnings impact from forward points in the same line item that is used to present the earnings impact of the hedged item, i.e., cost of goods sold, for hedging forecasted inventory purchases and such amount is not material for all periods presented. 
 
 Other Derivatives 
 
 The Company also enters into foreign currency exchange forward and swap contracts to reduce the short-term effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain receivables or payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of its subsidiaries. These contracts generally mature within approximately . The primary risk managed by using forward and swap contracts is the currency exchange rate risk. The gains or losses on these contracts are not material and included in other income (expense), net, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations based on the changes in fair value. The notional amounts of these contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 were million and million, respectively.

 Indemnifications 
 
 The Company indemnifies certain suppliers and customers for losses arising from matters such as intellectual property disputes and product safety defects, subject to certain restrictions. The scope of these indemnities varies, but in some instances includes indemnification for damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees. As of September 30, 2024, material amounts have been accrued for indemnification provisions. The Company does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid under its indemnification arrangements. 
 
 The Company also indemnifies its current and former directors and certain current and former officers. Certain costs incurred for providing such indemnification may be recoverable under various insurance policies. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the maximum amount that could be payable under these arrangements because these exposures are not capped, the obligations are conditional in nature, and the facts and circumstances involved in any situation that might arise are variable. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time the Company is involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business. The Company is currently subject to several such claims and legal proceedings. The Company intends to vigorously defend against them. Management periodically assesses the Company s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. The Company follows ASC

 share repurchase program, which allows the Company to use up to billion to repurchase its shares. The 2023 share repurchase program enables the Company to repurchase shares for cancellation, as well as to support equity incentive plans or potential acquisitions. The Swiss Takeover Board approved the 2023 share repurchase program in July 2023 and the program became effective on July 28, 2023. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased million shares for an aggregate cost of million under the 2023 share repurchase program for cancellation, of which million of the aggregate cost was not paid yet as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 , m illion was available for repurchase under the 2023 share repurchase program. 
 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased million shares for an aggregate cost of million under the 2023 share repurchase program for cancellation. In addition, the Company repurchased million shares for an aggregate cost of million under the previous share repurchase program during the six months ended September 30, 2023. This previous share repurchase program was initially approved by the Company's Board of Directors in May 2020, to purchase Logitech shares to support equity incentive plans or potential acquisitions, and expired on July 27, 2023. 
 
 Swiss law limits a company s ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. The aggregate par value of all shares held in treasury by the Company and its subsidiaries may not exceed of the share capital of the Company, which for the Company corresponds to approximately million registered shares. This limitation does not apply to shares repurchased for cancellation, due to the Board of Directors authority under the Company s capital band set forth in the Company s Articles of Incorporation to cancel shares up to a limit of of the Company's current share capital. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a total of million shares held in treasury stock, which includes million shares that have been repurchased for cancellation and million shares that have been purchased to support equity incentive plans or potential acquisitions. 
 
 To the extent that the shares are repurchased to support equity incentive plans or potential acquisitions, the shares are repurchased on the ordinary trading line of SIX Swiss Exchange SIX and/or The Nasdaq Global Select Market Nasdaq ). Shares repurchased for cancellation purposes are repurchased on a second trading line on SIX. Shares may be repurchased from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Purchases may be started or stopped at any time without prior notice depending on market conditions and other factors and the program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares. 
 
 Share Cancellation 
 
 In September 2024, the Company's Board of Directors approved the cancellation of million treasury shares, which were repurchased in fiscal year 2024 for an aggregate cost of million under the 2023 share repurchase program. The cancellation became effective in October 2024, and as a result both the number of registered shares issued and the number of treasury shares outstanding decreased by million shares. Upon cancellation of these shares, the Company deducted the par value from registered shares and reflected the excess of share repurchase cost over par value as a reduction to retained earnings.

Company Overview 
 Logitech designs software-enabled hardware solutions that help businesses thrive and bring people together when working, creating, gaming and streaming. As a point of connection between people and the digital world, our mission is to extend human potential in work and play, in a way that is good for people and the planet. We sell these products through a number of brands, including Logitech, Logitech G and others. 
 Our diverse portfolio includes: Gaming, Keyboards Combos, Pointing Devices, Video Collaboration, Webcams, Tablet Accessories, and Headsets. These products are all classified under a single operating segment: Peripherals (see Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 We sell our products to a broad network of international customers in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa EMEA and Asia Pacific. This includes direct sales to retailers, e-tailers, and end consumers through our e-commerce platform, and indirect sales to end customers through distributors. 
 From time to time, we may seek to partner with or acquire, when appropriate, companies that have products, personnel, and technologies that complement our strategic direction. We continually review our product offerings and our strategic direction in light of our profitability targets, competitive conditions, changing consumer trends and the evolving nature of the interface between the consumer and the digital world. 
 Impacts of Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Conditions on our Business 
 Our business has continued to be impacted by macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. These conditions include inflation, interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, changes in fiscal policies, geopolitical conflicts, low economic growth in certain regions, and uncertainty in consumer and enterprise demand. 
 The global and regional economic and political conditions have caused and may continue to cause volatility in demand for our products as well as cost of materials and logistics, and transportation delays, and as a result may impact the pricing of our products, product availability and our results of operations. 
 For additional information, see Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors." 
 Trends and Uncertainties 
 Several long-term secular-trends offer long-term structural growth opportunities across Logitech s product portfolio. We design, create and sell products that benefit from these secular trends which include the following: 
 Hybrid work: Hybrid work provides an opportunity to equip multiple workspaces including in the office and other places of work, as well as at home and away from home. Hybrid work also provides an opportunity for increased enterprise and consumer adoption of video conferencing. Our video collaboration products are compatible with a variety of video conference platforms, including Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet. 
 Gaming: The ongoing growth and evolution of gaming creates an opportunity for us to provide more tools to a wider community of gamers. In particular, social gaming continues to gain popularity through online gaming, multi-platform experiences and esports. 
 AI: AI has reshaped expectations for productivity improvements, product innovation and technology ecosystem evolution. While we have used AI solutions and machine learning to enhance the features of different products in our portfolio, AI offers additional growth opportunities and risks as we work to integrate our capabilities with our ecosystem partners. 
 Climate change: Climate change affects everyone. We already consider sustainability as part of our product design and in other areas and intend to continue to do so in the future. 
 The importance of trust: With our well-established Logitech brand, consumer-centric design philosophy, and commitment to high privacy and security standards, we strive to deliver trusted user experiences. 
 While we believe we will further benefit from these secular trends, we have experienced and will continue to experience challenges that impact our business and financial results. These challenges include (i) the current macroeconomic environment, including interest rate fluctuations, inflation, foreign exchange movements, changes in fiscal policies and low economic growth in certain regions, (ii) the uncertainty with overall consumer and enterprise demand, (iii) the uncertainty with enterprise strategy for office space utilization and related timing of enterprise investments in infrastructure and technology, and (iv) the timing of further development of our B2B go-to-market capabilities. 
 22 

We expect these challenges to continue in the near-term. We have taken steps to mitigate the impact of these challenges, including but not limited to: (i) maintaining discipline in our operating expenses, (ii) managing inventory levels to align with demand, (iii) continued investment in our B2B capabilities, and (iv) release of new products to increase the value proposition of our portfolio. 
 For additional information, see Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors." 
 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions 
 We have historically experienced higher sales in our third fiscal quarter ending December 31, compared to other fiscal quarters in our fiscal year, primarily due to the increased consumer demand for our products during the year-end holiday buying season and year-end spending by enterprises. Additionally, new product introductions and business acquisitions can significantly impact sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact our sales to distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often channel inventory of an earlier model product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction or changes in business circumstances. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of our future pattern of product introductions, future sales or financial performance. Furthermore, cash flow is correspondingly lower in the first half of our fiscal year as we typically build inventories in advance for the third quarter and we pay an annual dividend following our Annual General Meeting, which is typically in September. 
 Summary of Financial Results 
 Our total sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6 and 9 , compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily due to an increase in sales for Gaming, Keyboards Combos and Tablet Accessories , driven by improved demand. 
 Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 13 and 4 in the EMEA and Americas regions, respectively, and remained flat in the Asia Pacific region, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sales for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 16 , 6 , and 4 in the EMEA, Americas, and Asia Pacific regions, respectively, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gross margin was 43.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased by 210 basis points, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting lower product costs and lower inventory reserves driven by improved demand, partially offset by higher promotional spending. Gross margin was 43.2 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and increased by 310 basis points, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by lower product costs. 
 Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 325.2 million, or 29.1 of sales, compared to 282.0 million, or 26.7 of sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2024 were 638.0 million, or 28.9 of sales, compared to 579.2 million, or 28.5 of sales, for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expense was primarily driven by an increase in marketing and advertising spend. 
 We had an income tax provision of 30.6 million and 30.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , respectively. We had an income tax provision of 56.1 million and 42.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The change in the income tax provision for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, was primarily due to the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, the favorable tax impacts from share-based compensation and unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertain tax positions. 
 Net income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was 145.5 million and 287.3 million, respectively, compared to 137.1 million and 199.8 million, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make assumptions, judgments, and estimates, that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 
 23 

We consider an accounting estimate critical if it (i) requires management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and (ii) is important to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results. 
 We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for accruals for customer incentives and related breakage when appropriate, accrued sales return liability, inventory valuation, and uncertain tax positions, have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. 
 There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates during the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the critical accounting estimates disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recent accounting pronouncements to be adopted. 
 Constant Currency 
 We refer to our net sales growth rates excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations as "constant currency" sales growth rates. Percentage of constant currency sales growth is calculated by translating prior period sales in each local currency at the current period s average exchange rate for that currency and comparing that to current period sales. 
 Given our global sales presence and the reporting of our financial results in U.S. Dollars, our financial results could be affected by significant shifts in currency exchange rates. See Results of Operations for information on the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on our sales. If the U.S. Dollar appreciates or depreciates in comparison to other currencies in future periods, this will affect our results of operations in future periods as well. 
 References to Sales 
 The term sales means net sales, except as otherwise specified and the sales growth discussion and sales growth rate percentages are in U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise specified. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Net Sales 
 
 Our sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 i ncreased 6 and 9 , respectively, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in sales for Gaming, Keyboards Combos and Tablet Accessories , driven by improved demand . If currency exchange rates had been constant in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our sales growth rates in constant currency would have been the same as the above sales growth rates. 
 
 Sales Denominated in Other Currencies 
 
 Although our financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a portion of our sales was generated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, such as the Euro, Chinese Renminbi, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen, Pound Sterling and New Taiwan Dollar. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 49 of our sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.

 Investment gain (loss) related to the deferred compensation plan represents earnings, gains, and losses on marketable securities related to a deferred compensation plan offered by one of our subsidiaries. The increase in investment gain for three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily relates to the change in market performance of the underlying securities. 
 
 Currency exchange loss, net, relates to balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in our subsidiaries, as well as to the sale of currencies, and gains or losses recognized on currency exchange forward contracts. We do not speculate in currency positions, but we are alert to opportunities to maximize currency exchange gains and minimize currency exchange losses. The loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates of the Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. Dollar. The loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of the Swiss Franc against the U.S. Dollar. The loss for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates of the Chinese Renminbi and the Mexican Peso against the 
 29 

U.S. Dollar. The loss for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar. 
 
 Gain (loss) on investments, net, includes unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value of investments, gain (loss) on equity-method investments and impairment of investments during the periods presented, as applicable. The loss on investments, net, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and the gain on investments, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were not material. The loss on investments, net, for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an impairment loss, as a result of the write-off of a note receivable which has been deemed no longer recoverable. This note receivable was previously obtained in conjunction with an exchange transaction related to our investment in a privately held company. See Note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. 

Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes and effective income tax rates for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 
 Three months ended September 30, Six months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Provision for income taxes 30,583 30,334 56,141 42,866 Effective income tax rate 17.4 18.1 16.3 17.7 
 
 The change in the effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the change in the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, the favorable tax impacts from share-based compensation and unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertain tax positions. 
 
 The BEPS Project undertaken by the OECD recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, including a proposal to reallocate profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business Pillar One and establishing a minimum tax on global income Pillar Two ). Some jurisdictions, including Switzerland, where we operate are implementing Pillar Two laws to effectuate a 15 minimum tax. The minimum tax effective beginning in fiscal year 2025 for the Company, is treated as a current cost and does not have a material impact on the Company's effective tax rate. The OECD and participating countries continue to issue underlying rules and administrative guidance related to Pillar Two, and we continue to monitor the relevant developments. 
 We file Swiss and foreign tax returns. We received final tax assessments in Switzerland through fiscal year 2019. For other material foreign jurisdictions such as the United States, we are generally not subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal year 2020 and calendar year 2020, respectively. In the United States, the federal and state tax agencies have the authority to examine periods prior to fiscal year 2020, to the extent allowed by law, where tax attributes were generated, carried forward, and being utilized in subsequent years. We are under examination in foreign tax jurisdictions. If the examinations are resolved unfavorably, there is a possibility that they may have a material negative impact on our results of operations. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash Balances, Available Borrowings, and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1,363.3 million, compared with 1,520.8 million as of March 31, 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank demand deposits, short-term time deposits, and U.S. Treasury securities, of wh ich 71 is held in Switzerland and 11 is held in Germany. We do not expect to incur any material adverse tax impact except for what has already been recognized, or to be significantly inhibited by any country in which we do business, from the repatriation of funds to Switzerland, our country of domicile. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our working capital was 1,457.2 million, compared to 1,545.5 million as of March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in inventories and accounts receivable. 
 
 30 

We had several uncommitted, unsecured bank lines of credit and letters of credit aggregating 178.7 million as of September 30, 2024. There are no financial covenants under these lines of credit with which we must comply. There was no borrowing outstanding under the lines of credit as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding bank guarantees of 29.5 million. 
 
 The following tables present selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands): 
 As of September 30, 
 2024 2023 Accounts receivable, net 629,278 656,895 Accounts payable 555,490 492,905 Inventories 520,493 532,943

 51 56 Days accounts payable outstanding DPO (Days) (2) 
 79 72 Inventory turnover ITO (x) (3) 
 4.8 4.6 
 
 (1) DSO is determined using ending accounts receivable, net, as of the most recent quarter-end and sales for the most recent quarter. 
 (2) DPO is determined using ending accounts payable as of the most recent quarter-end and cost of goods sold for the most recent quarter. 
 (3) ITO is determined using ending inventories as of the most recent quarter-end and annualized cost of goods sold (based on cost of goods sold for the most recent quarter). 
 
 DSO for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 5 days to 51 days, compared to 56 days for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher sales from improved demand as well as timing of sales within the quarter. 
 
 DPO for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 7 days to 79 days, compared to 72 days for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher inventory purchases during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 to align with demand. 
 
 ITO for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.2 to 4.8, compared to 4.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower inventory balances driven by our efforts to manage inventory levels as well as due to improved demand. 
 
 If we are not successful in launching and phasing in our new products, or market competition increases, or we are not able to sell the new products at the prices planned, it could have a material impact on our sales, gross profit margin, operating results including operating cash flow, and inventory turnover in the future. 
 
 The following table summarizes our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands): 
 Six months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 342,031 463,059 Net cash used in investing activities (31,326) (49,151) Net cash used in financing activities (474,954) (388,269) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 6,683 (10,758) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (157,566) 14,881 
 31 

For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 342.0 million resulting from net income of 287.3 million, a favorable impact from adding back non-cash expenses totaling 107.3 million, partially offset by an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of 52.6 million. Non-cash adjustments were primarily related to share-based compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes. The increase in accounts receivable, net, was primarily driven by higher sales. The increases in inventories and accounts payable were due to higher inventory purchases to replenish certain products. 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 31.3 million, primarily resulting from 29.1 million of purchases of property, plant, and equipment. 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 475.0 million, primarily resulting from payment for repurchases of our registered shares of 263.2 million and payment of cash dividends of 207.9 million. 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was not material. 
 
 Cash Outlook 
 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow generated from operations, and, to a much lesser extent, capital markets and borrowings. Our future working capital requirements and capital expenditures may increase to support investments in product innovations and growth opportunities or to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies. Market volatility driven by the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment may increase our costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 
 In fiscal year 2025, we paid a cash dividend of CHF 176.3 million (U.S. Dollar amount of 207.9 million based on the exchange rate on the date of payment) out of fiscal year 2024 retained earnings. In fiscal year 2024, we paid a cash dividend of CHF 169.1 million (U.S. Dollar amount of 182.3 million based on the exchange rate on the date of payment) out of fiscal year 2023 retained earnings. 
 
 In June 2023, our Board of Directors approved a three-year share repurchase program, which allows us to use up to 1.0 billion to repurchase our shares. The 2023 share repurchase program enables us to repurchase shares for cancellation, as well as to support equity incentive plans or potential acquisitions. The Swiss Takeover Board approved the 2023 share repurchase program in July 2023 and the program became effective on July 28, 2023. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for an aggregate cost of 262.1 million, under the 2023 share repurchase program for cancellation, of which 18.4 million of the aggregate cost was not paid yet as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 , 373.9 m illion was available for repurchase under the 2023 share repurchase program. 
 
 Swiss law limits a company s ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. The aggregate par value of all shares held in treasury by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our share capital, which corresponds to approximately 17.3 million registered shares. This limitation does not apply to shares repurchased for cancellation, due to the Board of Directors' authority under the capital band set forth in the Company's Articles of Incorporation to cancel shares up to a limit of 10 of our current share capital. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 21.3 million shares held in treasury stock, which includes 7.0 million shares that have been repurchased for cancellation and 14.3 million shares that have been purchased to support equity incentive plans or potential acquisitions. 
 
 Although we enter into trading plans for systematic repurchases (e.g., 10b5-1 trading plans) from time to time, our 2023 share repurchase program provides us with the opportunity to make opportunistic repurchases during periods of favorable market conditions and is expected to remain in effect for a period of three years through July 27, 2026. To the extent that the shares are repurchased to support equity incentive plans or potential acquisitions, the shares are repurchased on the ordinary trading line of Swiss Exchange ("SIX") and/or the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq"). Shares repurchased for cancellation purposes are repurchased via a second trading line on SIX. Opportunistic purchases may be started or stopped at any time without prior notice depending on market conditions and other factors. 
 32 

If we do not generate sufficient operating cash flows to support our operations and future planned cash requirements, our operations could be harmed and our access to credit facilities could be restricted or eliminated. However, we believe that the trend of our historical cash flow generation, our projections of future operations and our available cash balances will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. 
 
 Operating Leases Obligations 
 
 We lease facilities under operating leases, certain of which require us to pay property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Operating leases for facilities are generally renewable at our option and usually include escalation clauses linked to inflation . There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. The remaining terms of our non-cancelable operating leases expire in various years through 2035. 
 
 Purchase Commitments 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had non-cancelable purchase commitments of 455.3 million for inventory purchases made in the normal course of business from original design manufacturers, contract manufacturers and other suppliers, the majority of which are expected to be fulfilled within the next 12 months. We recorded a liability for firm, non-cancelable, and unhedged inventory purchase commitments in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value consistent with our valuation of excess and obsolete inventory. As of September 30, 2024, the liability for these purchase commitments was 21.8 million and is recorded in accrued and other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 We have firm purchase commitments of 12.1 million for capital expenditures primarily related to commitments for tooling and equipment for new and existing products. We expect to continue making capital expenditures in the future to support product development activities and ongoing and expanded operations. Although open purchase commitments are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us to reschedule or adjust our requirements based on business needs prior to delivery of goods or performance of services. 
 
 Other Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 For further detail about our contractual obligations and commitments, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 Indemnifications 
 
 We indemnify certain suppliers and customers for losses arising from matters such as intellectual property disputes and product safety defects, subject to certain restrictions. The scope of these indemnities varies, but in some instances includes indemnification for damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees. As of September 30, 2024, no material amounts have been accrued for indemnification provisions. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid under our indemnification arrangements. 
 
 We also indemnify our current and former directors and certain current and former officers. Certain costs incurred for providing such indemnification may be recoverable under various insurance policies. We are unable to reasonably estimate the maximum amount that could be payable under these arrangements because these exposures are not capped, the obligations are conditional in nature, and the facts and circumstances involved in any situation that might arise are variable. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we are involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. For more information about Legal Proceedings, see Part II Item 1 Legal Proceedings of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. As a company with global operations, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates and interest rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. 
 
 Currency Exchange Rates 
 
 We report our results in U.S. Dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. Dollar can have a material impact on our results when the financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars. The functional currency of our operations is primarily the U.S. Dollar. Certain operations use the Swiss Franc or the local currency of the country as their functional currencies. Accordingly, unrealized currency gains or losses resulting from the translation of net assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies to the U.S. Dollar are accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") in shareholders' equity. 
 
 We are exposed to currency exchange rate risk as we transact business in multiple currencies, including exposure related to anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We transact business in approximately 30 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant to operations are the Euro, Chinese Renminbi, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen, Pound Sterling and New Taiwan Dollar. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 49 of our sales were in non-U.S. denominated currencies, with 24 of our sales denominated in Euro. The mix of our costs of goods sold and operating expenses by currency are significantly different from the mix of our sales, with a larger portion denominated in U.S. Dollar and less denominated in Euro and other currencies. A strengthening U.S. Dollar has a more unfavorable impact on our sales compared to the favorable impact on our cost of goods sold and operating expenses, resulting in an adverse impact on our operating results. 
 
 We enter into currency forward and swap contracts to reduce the short-term effects of currency fluctuations on certain receivables or payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries. These contracts generally mature within approximately one month . The gains or losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings based on the changes in fair value. 
 
 If an adverse 10 foreign currency exchange rate change had been applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet dates, it would have resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately 16.7 million and 19.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The adverse effect as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately 9.2 million and 6.9 million, respectively, from foreign exchange contracts in place as of such dates. 
 
 We enter into cash flow hedge contracts to protect against exchange rate exposure of forecasted inventory purchases. These hedging contracts mature within approximately four months. Gains and losses in the fair value of the effective portion of the hedges are deferred as a component of AOCI until the hedged inventory purchases are sold, at which time the gains or losses are reclassified to cost of goods sold. 
 
 If the U.S. Dollar had weakened by 10 , the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 would have been approximately 14.4 million and 9.0 million lower, respectively. The change in the fair value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in cost of goods sold when the hedged inventory purchases are sold. 
 
 34 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Logitech's management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Definition of Disclosure Controls 
 
 Disclosure Controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s Disclosure Controls include components of its internal control over financial reporting, which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. To the extent that components of the Company s internal control over financial reporting are included within its Disclosure Controls, they are included in the scope of the Company s annual controls evaluation. 
 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 The Company s management, including the CEO and the CFO, does not expect that the Company s Disclosure Controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 35 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business. The Company is currently subject to several such claims and legal proceedings. The Company intends to vigorously defend against them. Management periodically assesses the Company s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. The Company follows ASC ("Accounting Standards Codification") 450, Contingencies, in determining the accounting and disclosure for these contingencies. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that resolution of pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and there can be no assurances that the Company's defenses will be successful or that any such lawsuit or claim would not have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations in a particular period. Any claims or proceedings against the Company can have an adverse impact because of defense costs, diversion of management and operational resources, negative publicity and other factors. Any failure to obtain a necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims, could adversely affect the Company's business. 
 
 As a result of Regulation S-K disclosure requirements related to environmental proceedings to which the government is a party and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions, the Company selected the quantitative threshold of 1.0 million. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 The Company s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 (the "2024 Form 10-K"), under the heading Risk Factors. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company's risk factors since the 2024 Form 10-K, except as indicated below. 
 
 The collection, storage, transmission, use and distribution of personal data could give rise to liabilities and additional costs of operation as a result of laws, governmental regulation and risks of data breaches and security incidents. 
 
 In connection with our operations, we collect and otherwise process personal data, including that of our consumers. The processing of this information is increasingly subject to legislation, regulations and enforcement in numerous jurisdictions around the world. Global data privacy regulation is increasingly fragmented, with increasing enforcement efforts and penalties. Such fragmentation requires more complex and costly compliance structures, while heightened enforcement increases the cost and reputational risk associated with even minor compliance errors. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which is applicable to us and to all companies processing data of people in the European Union, imposes significant fines and sanctions for violation of the Regulation. Compliance with the GDPR's international transfer rules has been made more difficult by the invalidation of the European Union-U.S. Privacy Shield and we are now required to put in place additional privacy protective measures for transfer of data of people in the European Union to certain countries outside of the European Economic Area. In the United States, several states have adopted broad privacy laws. Such laws and regulations are typically intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information and its collection, storage, transmission, use, disclosure and other processing. For example, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA ), which, among other things, requires covered companies to provide disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (the CPRA ), was approved by California voters in November 2020. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA and has made compliance more uncertain and complex. Additionally, other U.S. states continue to propose, and in certain cases adopt, privacy-focused legislation. Other laws and regulations may follow, at state and federal levels. Other regions also have robust data protection and privacy legislation. For example, China has enacted the Personal Information Protection Law of the People s Republic of China PIPL ), which strictly regulates the processing of personal information and the transfer of personal data of Chinese residents to territories outside of China. 
 
 36 

In addition, because various jurisdictions have different laws and regulations concerning the use, storage, transmission and other processing of such information, we may face requirements that pose compliance challenges in existing markets as well as new international markets that we seek to enter. The collection and processing of personal data also heightens the risk of security breaches and other data security issues related to our IT systems and the systems of third-party data storage and other service and IT providers. Such laws and regulations, variation between jurisdictions and risks presented by our processing of personal data could limit our ability to use data and develop new features and services, subject us to increased costs, require allocation of additional resources and changes to our policies and practices, which may be difficult to achieve in a commercially reasonable manner or at all. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with these laws, regulations, or other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy or the collection, use or other processing of personal data may lead to significant fines, penalties, regulatory investigations, lawsuits, significant costs for remediation, damage to our reputation, or other liabilities, all of which could adversely affect our business.
