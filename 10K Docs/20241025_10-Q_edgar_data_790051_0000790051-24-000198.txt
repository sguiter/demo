 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On April 3, 2024, the Company and Carlisle, LLC, as co-borrowers, entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a billion unsecured revolving line of credit with a maturity date of April 3, 2029 and amends and restates the Company's Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended (the "Prior Credit Agreement"), which was scheduled to expire on February 5, 2025. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company's election, (i) at the Base Rate plus a margin ranging from to or (ii) at the applicable benchmark rate plus a margin ranging from to , in each case, based on the Company s debt rating from time to time. The benchmark rate for loans denominated in (i) U.S. dollars is the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, (ii) Canadian dollars is the Adjusted Term CORRA Rate, (iii) Sterling is Daily Simple SONIA, (iv) euros is the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate and (v) yen is Adjusted TIBOR Rate. The commitments are also subject to a facility fee on the daily aggregate amount of the revolving commitment (whether used or unused) ranging from to based on the Company s debt rating from time to time. Funding of the loans under the Credit Agreement is subject to customary drawdown conditions. The Company incurred million of financing costs in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with finalizing the Credit Agreement, which together with any existing unamortized costs, will be recognized ratably over the new extended maturity date of the Credit Agreement. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, borrowings and repayments under the Credit Agreement totaled million with a weighted average interest rate of . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding balance and billion available for use under the Credit Agreement and the Prior Credit Agreement, respectively. 
 Covenants and Limitations

 In October 2024, the Company entered into an agreement under which approximately million of million in pension obligations in its defined benefit pension plans were transferred to an insurance company. Under the agreement, the Company will purchase a group annuity contract for approximately plan participants that will provide for an irrevocable commitment to make annuity payments to the affected participants. The payment obligation for the affected participants will be transferred from the pension plans to the insurance company. The transfer will not change the amount of the monthly pension benefits received by the affected participants. 
 The purchase of the group annuity contract will be funded through existing plan assets. The Company expects to recognize a non-cash pension settlement charge of approximately million before tax in the fourth quarter of 2024. This charge represents the acceleration of deferred charges currently accrued in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The actual amount of the settlement charge will depend on the value of plan assets and the discount rate as of the measurement date. 
 
 Note 14) ) Non-designated hedges ) ) 
 (1) The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is included in other current assets (accrued and other current liabilities). The fair value was estimated using observable market inputs such as forward and spot prices of the underlying exchange rate pair.

. The changes in the fair value of the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in the same line item as the impact of the hedged item, revenues or cost of sales, when the underlying forecasted transaction impacts earnings. The change in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to foreign currency cash flow hedges was immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Gains and losses on the contracts representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in the same line item as the hedged item, revenues or cost of sales, currently. 
 Non-Designated Hedges 
 For instruments that are not designated as a cash flow hedge, the Company had foreign exchange contracts with maturities less than . The unrealized gains and losses resulting from these contracts were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and are recognized in other non-operating expense, net and partially offset corresponding foreign exchange gains and losses on these balances. 
 Rabbi Trust 
 The Company has established a Rabbi Trust to provide for a degree of financial security to cover its obligations under its deferred compensation plan.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Carlisle Companies Incorporated Carlisle , the Company , we , us or our is a leading manufacturer and supplier of innovative building envelope products and solutions for more energy efficient buildings. Through our building products businesses, Carlisle Construction Materials ("CCM") and Carlisle Weatherproofing Technologies ("CWT"), and family of leading brands, we deliver innovative, labor-reducing and environmentally responsible products and solutions to customers through the Carlisle Experience. Carlisle is committed to generating superior stockholder returns and maintaining a balanced capital deployment approach, including investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases and continued dividend increases. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. All references to "Notes" refer to our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Executive Overview 
 Carlisle delivered another quarter of strong performance, despite a continued decline in residential markets along with the impact of weather-related and port strike events, which negatively impacted shipping days, contractor days on the roof and manufacturing output. We continued to execute on our Vision 2030 strategies, and we are pleased with our third quarter performance against our 2030 goals. 
 CCM continued its strong momentum with its 2024 accomplishments into the third quarter, driven by healthy contractor backlogs, robust re-roofing activity, and excellent margin performance. CCM sales were up 9 year-over-year assisted by the inventory normalization in the channel and the acquisition of MTL Holdings LLC ("MTL"). CCM's 30.4 operating margin and 32.8 adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter reflected strong volume leverage, a positive raw material environment, and excellent operating execution through the Carlisle Operating System (COS). 
 As we look at CWT s performance, while we were pleased with progress on share gain initiatives within CWT, a higher interest rate environment, low housing turnover, and affordability challenges resulted in a further slowing of housing activity in the quarter. For the quarter, these challenges impacted sales and drove a decline of 3 year-over-year. Despite the near-term challenges facing CWT, we remain pleased and optimistic about the prospects for this segment. 
 We continue to be encouraged by the positive long-term outlook in the North American building products markets and the strength of the Carlisle business model. Our pivot to a pure play building products company is delivering the expected outcomes and demonstrating our commitment to being superior capital allocators. Additionally, we believe that leveraging the megatrends around energy efficiency and labor savings, along with growing re-roof demand, and our introduction of innovative new products, are creating additional catalysts for growth. Similar to Vision 2025, we believe Vision 2030 positions us well to drive above-market growth and earn a premium in the marketplace. 
 Carlisle remains committed to generating superior shareholder returns through our balanced capital deployment approach. This quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock for 466.1 million and increased our dividend 18 , marking the 48th consecutive annual dividend increase. 
 We are excited about our recent agreement to acquire PFB Holdco, Inc. ("Plasti-Fab"), which aligns with our Vision 2030 strategy to enhance our best-in-class building envelope product portfolio following the completion of our pivot to a pure play building products company earlier this year. The acquisition of Plasti-Fab establishes Carlisle as a leading manufacturer in the 1.5 billion North American expanded polystyrene insulation market and provides vertically integrated polystyrene capabilities to our Insulfoam business while adding scale, supporting retail channel growth, and filling key geographic gaps in the U.S. and Canada.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 A summary of our cash and cash equivalents by region follows: 
 (in millions) 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Europe 14.3 14.0 North America (excluding U.S.) 12.2 34.1 China 3.3 9.8 International cash and cash equivalents 
 29.8 57.9 U.S. cash and cash equivalents 1,500.8 518.8 Total cash and cash equivalents 1,530.6 576.7 
 We maintain liquidity sources primarily consisting of cash and cash equivalents as well as availability under our credit facilities. In the near term, cash on hand is our primary source of liquidity. The increase in cash and cash equivalents compared to December 31, 2023, is primarily related to proceeds from our sale of CIT and cash generated from operations, partially offset by cash used on share repurchases, the purchase of MTL, payment of dividends to stockholders and capital expenditures. 
 In certain countries, our cash is subject to local laws and regulations that require government approval for conversion of such cash to U.S. Dollars, as well as for transfer of such cash, both temporarily and permanently outside of that jurisdiction. In addition, upon permanent transfer of cash outside of certain jurisdictions, primarily in Canada, we may be subject to withholding taxes, and as such we have accrued 6.3 million in anticipation of those taxes as of September 30, 2024. 
 We believe we have sufficient cash on hand, availability under our credit facilities and operating cash flows to meet our anticipated business requirements for at least the next 12 months. At the discretion of management, the Company may use available cash on capital expenditures, dividends, acquisitions, strategic investments or repurchases, redemptions or retirements of securities, including our common stock. 
 We also anticipate we will have sufficient cash on hand, availability under our credit facilities and operating cash flows to meet our anticipated long-term business requirements and to pay outstanding principal balances of our existing notes by the respective maturity dates. Another potential source of liquidity is access to public capital markets, subject to market conditions. We may access the capital markets for a variety of reasons, including to repay the outstanding balances of our outstanding debt and fund acquisitions. Refer to Note 12 for information on our long-term debt.

Lower operating cash flows of 152.7 million for the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflected 
 28 

lower operating cash provided by discontinued operations of 152.3 million and higher working capital uses of 196.3 million, partially offset by higher income from continuing operations of 175.5 million. 
 The increase in working capital uses related to a decrease in cash from higher inventory investments in 2024 of 220.9 million, reflecting the end of destocking of inventory experienced in 2023 and increased construction activity, and accounts receivable of 11.8 million, reflecting higher sales volumes. The increase in working capital uses was partially offset by an increase in cash from accounts payable of 17.1 million, related to higher inventory investments, and in accrued expenses of 30.4 million, reflecting lower payments in the year for customer incentives, rebates and cash bonuses related to 2023 performance. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities of 1,508.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflected proceeds from the sale of CIT, net of cash disposed, of 1,998.0 million, offset by the purchase of MTL for 414.3 million, net of cash acquired, and capital expenditures of 76.7 million. Cash used in investing activities of 86.7 million for the first nine months of 2023 primarily reflected capital expenditures of 106.3 million, partially offset by the sale of equipment of 18.7 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities of 1,242.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflected share repurchases of 1,166.1 million and cash dividend payments of 127.4 million, reflecting the increased quarterly dividend of 1.00 per share, partially offset by net proceeds of 55.4 million from the exercising of stock options.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT"), adjusted EBIT, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and adjusted EBITDA margin are intended to provide investors and others with information about our performance and our segments' performance without the effect of items that, by their nature, tend to obscure core operating results due to potential variability across periods based on the timing, frequency and magnitude of such items. As a result, management believes that these measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze trends in our business and evaluate our performance relative to similarly-situated companies. This information differs from net income, operating income, and operating margin determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. Our and our segments' EBIT, adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin follows. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally use words such as "expect," "foresee," "anticipate," "believe," "project," "should," "estimate," "will," "plans," "intends," "forecast," and similar expressions, and reflect our expectations concerning the future. Such statements are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of publication and, as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen risks and uncertainties. It is possible that our future performance may differ materially from current expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements, due to a variety of factors such as: increasing price and product/service competition by foreign and domestic competitors, including new entrants; technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; our mix of products/services; increases in raw material costs that cannot be recovered in product pricing; domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, including environmental and industry regulations; the ability to meet our goals relating to our intended reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, including our net zero commitments; threats associated with and efforts to combat terrorism; protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights; the identification of strategic acquisition targets and our successful completion of any transaction and integration of our strategic acquisitions; our successful completion of strategic dispositions; the cyclical nature of our businesses; the impact of information technology, cybersecurity or data security breaches at our businesses or third parties; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, including, for example, expectations regarding their impact on our businesses, including on customer demand, supply chains and distribution systems, production, our ability to maintain appropriate labor levels, our ability to ship products to our customers, our future results, or our full-year financial outlook; and the other factors discussed in the reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, the condition of the financial and credit markets and general domestic and international economic conditions, including inflation and interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Further, any conflict in the international arena, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and war in the Middle East, may adversely affect general market conditions and our future performance. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement is made, and we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date on which that statement is made, unless otherwise required by law. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of those factors, nor can it assess the impact of each of those factors on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.
