FORWARD-LOOKING AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS 
 This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements and other information that is based on management s current expectations as of the date of this report. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs, opinions, or expectations and statements that assume or are dependent upon future events, are forward-looking statements and often contain words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek, see, will, would, may, could, should, goals, or target. Such statements are based on management's expectations as of the date of this filing and involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties are discussed more fully under the section titled Risk Factors and include, but are not limited to the following: 
 
 general economic conditions, including the potential impact of inflation and interest rates on Navient and its clients and customers and on the creditworthiness of third parties; 

increased defaults on education loans held by us; 

unanticipated repayment trends on education loans including prepayments or deferrals resulting from new interpretations or the timing of the execution and implementation of current laws, rules or regulations or future laws, executive orders or other policy initiatives that operate to encourage or require consolidation, abolish existing or create additional income-based repayment or debt forgiveness programs or establish other policies and programs or extensions of previously announced deadlines which may increase or decrease the prepayment rates on education loans and accelerate or slow down the repayment of the bonds in our securitization trusts; 

a reduction in our credit ratings; 

changes to applicable laws, rules, regulations and government policies and expanded regulatory and governmental oversight; 

changes in the general interest rate environment, including the availability of any relevant money-market index rate or the relationship between the relevant money-market index rate and the rate at which our assets are priced; 

the interest rate characteristics of our assets do not always match those of our funding arrangements; 

adverse market conditions or an inability to effectively manage our liquidity risk or access liquidity could negatively impact us; 

the cost and availability of funding in the capital markets; 

our ability to earn Floor Income and our ability to enter into hedges relative to that Floor Income are dependent on the future interest rate environment and therefore is variable; 

our use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risk; 

our ability to continually and effectively align our cost structure with our business operations; 

a failure or breach of our operating systems, infrastructure or information technology systems; 

failure by any third party providing us material services or products or a breach or violation of law by one of these third parties; 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment; 

acquisitions, strategic initiatives and investments or divestitures that we pursue; 

shareholder activism; and 

reputational risk and social factors. 

Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this Form 10-Q and in other documents we file from time to time with the SEC that disclose risks and uncertainties that may affect our business. 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements also requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions including estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates or assumptions may prove to be incorrect and actual results could differ materially. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are qualified by these cautionary statements and are made only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements except as required by law. 
 Through this discussion and analysis, we intend to provide the reader with some narrative context for how our management views our consolidated financial statements, additional context within which to assess our operating results, and information on the quality and variability of our earnings, liquidity and cash flows. 
 
 1 

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 We prepare financial statements and present financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments and present our financial results on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as Core Earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We provide this Core Earnings basis of presentation on a consolidated basis and for each business segment because this is what we review internally when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources. We also include this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. Because our Core Earnings basis of presentation is our measure of profit or loss for our segments, we are required by GAAP to provide Core Earnings disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our business segments. 
 In addition to Core Earnings, we present the following other non-GAAP financial measures: Tangible Equity, Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio, Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization Expense (EBITDA) (for the Business Processing segment), and Allowance for Loan Losses Excluding Expected Future Recoveries on Previously Fully Charged-off Loans. Definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are provided below, except that reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not provided because the Company is unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and financial impact of certain items, including, but not limited to, the impact of any mark-to-market gains/losses resulting from our use of derivative instruments to hedge our economic risks. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a further discussion and a complete reconciliation between GAAP net income and Core Earnings.

Commitment to compliance . We maintain a robust, multi-layered compliance management system and thoroughly understand and comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws. We follow the industry-leading Three Lines Model compliance framework. This framework and other compliance protocols ensure we adhere to key industry laws and regulations including but not limited to: Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA); Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA); Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA); Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA); Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA); Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA); Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); IRS Publication 1075; Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA); Military Lending Act (MLA); Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA); Truth in Lending Act (TILA); Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts and Practices (UDAAP); state laws; and state and city licensing.

Energy efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) and CO2 equivalents are among the many factors considered in our real estate decisions. 
 
 Maximizing Cash Flows from Loan Portfolios and Maintaining a Strong Balance Sheet 
 
 Our third-quarter 2024 results continue to demonstrate the strength of our balance sheet, credit risk management and underwriting of high-quality private education loans with attractive economics. 
 
 Our business generates significant capital which allows for a strong capital return to our investors. Navient expects to continue to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in accordance with our capital allocation policy. 
 
 By optimizing capital adequacy and allocating capital to highly accretive opportunities, including organic growth and acquisitions, we remain well positioned to pay dividends and repurchase stock, while maintaining appropriate leverage that supports our credit ratings and ensures ongoing access to capital markets. 
 
 In December 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 1 billion of the Company s outstanding common stock. At September 30, 2024, 176 million remained in share repurchase authorization. 
 
 To inform our capital allocation decisions, we use the Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio (1) in addition to other metrics. Our GAAP equity-to-asset ratio was 5.0 and our Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio (1) was 9.8 as of September 30, 2024.

Recent Business Developments 
 On January 30, 2024, as a result of an in-depth review of our business, Navient announced strategic actions to simplify our company, reduce our expense base, and enhance our flexibility. We have made substantial progress on these actions as follows: 
 
 Adopt a variable, outsourced servicing model. Navient entered into an outsourcing agreement in May 2024 that transitions our student loan servicing to MOHELA, a leading provider of student loan servicing for government and commercial enterprises. This transaction is intended to create a variable cost structure for the servicing of our student loan portfolios and provides attractive unit economics across a wide range of servicing volume scenarios. As part of the agreement, as of July 1, 2024, MOHELA began servicing our portfolio with nearly 900 employees transferring to MOHELA. In October 2024, we largely completed the borrower transition after a multi-stage communication strategy which was designed to educate borrowers in advance of the transition. Borrowers will continue to use the same account numbers, phone numbers, payment plans, and other details. Navient and MOHELA use the same third-party loan servicing technology platform, so a loan system conversion is not required. Navient will oversee the high service level standards contained in the servicing agreement. 

Explore strategic options for the business processing segment, including potential divestment. Navient previously launched a process to explore divesting our business processing segment. Through various subsidiary brands, this segment provides high-quality business processing services to a variety of government clients, including toll-road authorities, state revenue divisions, and federal agencies. In conjunction with the decision to outsource student loan servicing, exploring options for the business processing segment increases the opportunities for shared cost reduction. On September 19, 2024, Navient completed the sale of its equity interests in Xtend, which comprised the Company's healthcare services business in its Business Processing segment, to CorroHealth for 369 million resulting in a 219 million gain on sale. Navient continues to explore various divestiture options for its Government Services business. 

Streamline shared services infrastructure and corporate footprint. As we implement the above actions, we are also reshaping our shared services functions and corporate footprint to align with the needs of a more focused, flexible and streamlined company. The 35 million of restructuring and other reorganization charges recognized in 2024 (the vast majority of which relates to severance in connection with job abolishments) reflects the progress made to date in connection with this effort. 

We continue to expect to be largely complete with these strategic actions by the end of 2025. 
 How We Organi ze Our Business 
 We operate our business in three primary segments: Federal Education Loans, Consumer Lending and Business Processing. 
 
 Federal Education Loans Segment 
 Navient owns and manages FFELP Loans and is the master servicer on this portfolio. Our long history of servicing quality, data-driven strategies and omnichannel education about federal repayment options translate into positive results for the millions of borrowers we serve. We generate revenue primarily through net interest income on our FFELP Loans. 
 5 

Consumer Lending Segment 
 Navient owns and manages Private Education Loans and is the master servicer for these portfolios. Through our Earnest brand, we also refinance and originate in-school Private Education Loans. "Refinance" Private Education Loans are loans where a borrower has refinanced their education loans, and "In-school" Private Education Loans are loans originally made to borrowers while they are attending school. We generate revenue primarily through net interest income on our Private Education Loan portfolio. 
 Through our Earnest brand, we help students and families on the planning and paying for college journey. Our digital tools empower people to find scholarships and compare financial aid offers. We believe our 50 years of experience, product design, digital marketing strategies, and origination and servicing expertise provide a unique competitive advantage. We see meaningful growth opportunities in originating Private Education Loans, generating attractive long-term, risk-adjusted returns. 
 Business Processing Segment 
 Navient provides business processing solutions such as omnichannel contact center services, workflow processing, and revenue cycle optimization. We leverage the same expertise and intelligent tools we use to deliver successful results for portfolios we own. Our support enables our clients to ensure better constituent outcomes, meet rapidly changing needs, improve technology, reduce operating expenses, manage risk and optimize revenue opportunities. Our clients include: 
 Government : We offer our solutions to federal agencies, state governments, tolling and parking authorities, and other public sector clients. 

Healthcare : This business was sold on September 19, 2024. See "Recent Business Developments" for more detail. 

Other Segment 
 This segment consists of our corporate liquidity portfolio, gains and losses incurred on the repurchase of debt, unallocated expenses of shared services (which includes regulatory expenses) and restructuring/other reorganization expenses.

T he Quarter i n Review 
 We prepare financial statements and present financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments and present financial results on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as Core Earnings. We provide this Core Earnings basis of presentation on a consolidated basis and for each business segment because this is what we review internally when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources. We also include this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. Because our Core Earnings basis of presentation corresponds to our segment financial presentations, we are required by GAAP to provide certain Core Earnings disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our business segments. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures Core Earnings for a further discussion and a complete reconciliation between GAAP net income and Core Earnings. 
 Third-quarter 2024 GAAP net loss was 2 million 0.02 diluted loss per share), compared with 79 million net income 0.65 diluted earnings per share) in the year-ago quarter. See Results of Operations GAAP Comparison of Third-Quarter 2024 Results with Third-Quarter 2023" for a discussion of the primary contributors to the change in GAAP earnings between periods. Goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment of 138 million related to the Government Services business was recognized in the current quarter. This is the primary difference between GAAP and Core Earnings as Core Earnings exclude all goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment and amortization expense. 
 Third-quarter 2024 Core Earnings net income was 160 million 1.45 diluted Core Earnings per share), compared with 57 million 0.47 diluted Core Earnings per share) in the year-ago quarter. See Segment Results for a discussion of the primary contributors to the change in Core Earnings between periods. 
 GAAP and Core Earnings results included a net increase to pre-tax income of 166 million 1.17 diluted earnings per share) comprised of the following items: 
 A gain of 219 million 1.54 diluted earnings per share) from the sale of Xtend Healthcare, our healthcare services business. 

21 million 0.15 diluted loss per share) of provision for loan losses related to lowering the expected recovery rate on defaulted Private Education Loans. 

18 million 0.12 diluted loss per share) of restructuring expenses and 14 million 0.10 diluted loss per share) of regulatory-related expenses, primarily related to the settlement agreement with the CFPB in September, eliminating the overhang of a contingent liability.

GAAP Comparison of Third-Quarter 2024 Results with Third-Quarter 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was 2 million, or 0.02 diluted loss per common share, compared with net income of 79 million, or 0.65 diluted earnings per common share, for the year-ago period. 
 The primary contributors to the change in net income are as follows: 
 Net interest income decreased by 171 million primarily as a result of the year-ago quarter having a 48 million benefit related to a decrease in the speed of loan premium amortization in connection with the continued extension of a portion of the FFELP Loan portfolio. In addition, the paydown of the FFELP and Private Education Loan portfolios, the maturity of Floor Income hedges related to the FFELP Loan portfolio, the impact of increasing interest rates on the different index resets for the FFELP Loan assets and debt, and a 29 million decrease in mark-to-market gains on fair value hedges recorded in interest expense contributed to the decrease in net interest income. 

Provisions for loan losses decreased 30 million from 72 million to 42 million: 

o The provision for FFELP Loan losses decreased 41 million from 36 million to (5) million. 

o The provision for Private Education Loan losses increased 11 million from 36 million to 47 million. 

The provision for FFELP Loan losses of (5) million in the current period was the result of relatively stable credit trends and elevated prepayment activity over the prior year. The 36 million of provision in the year-ago quarter was primarily a result of the continued extension of a portion of the FFELP Loan portfolio and the resulting increase in both the expected future defaults and the premium allocated to all expected future defaults. 
 The provision for Private Education Loan losses of 47 million in the current period included 21 million related to changes in the net charge-off rates on defaulted loans, 15 million in connection with loan originations and 11 million related to a general reserve build. The provision of 36 million in the year-ago period included 29 million related to changes in the net charge-off rates on defaulted loans and 12 million in connection with loan originations, partially offset by a 5 million reserve release. 
 A gain of 219 million was recognized in the current quarter from the sale of 100 of our equity interests for 369 million cash, on September 19, 2024, of Xtend Healthcare, our healthcare services business. 

Asset recovery and business processing revenue decreased 15 million primarily as a result of a decrease in our government services revenue related to congressional funding not being approved to continue performing services under a particular contract. 

Net gains on derivative and hedging activities decreased 62 million, primarily due to interest rate fluctuations. Valuations of derivative instruments fluctuate based upon many factors including changes in interest rates and other market factors. As a result, net gains and losses on derivative and hedging activities may vary significantly in future periods. 

Operating expenses decreased 49 million, primarily due to a 33 million decrease in regulatory expense. In the current period there was 18 million of regulatory-related expense recorded in connection with the 120 million settlement agreement entered into with the CFPB in September. The year-ago period had 45 million of regulatory expense related to the same matter. In addition, there was a decline in the business processing segment expenses as a result of the government services contract discussed above. 

Goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment and amortization expense increased by 137 million as a result of a 138 million impairment recognized in the current quarter related to our government services business. The impairment was recognized primarily as a result of being informed in September that a contract that represents a significant portion of Government Services net income 6 million and 18 million of revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively) would not be renewed in 2025. In addition, a federal program which is a significant part of a Government Services contract remained unfunded during the third quarter. There has been increased uncertainty as to when or if there will be congressional approval to fund this program which would result in the resumption of services provided by Government Services under this contract. 

Restructuring and other reorganization expenses increased 14 million primarily due to an increase in severance-related costs. The current quarter s restructuring and other reorganization expenses of 18 million included 13 million of severance-related costs in connection with the various strategic initiatives being implemented to simplify the company, reduce our expense base and enhance our flexibility. 

11 

The effective income tax rates for the current and year-ago quarters were 120 and 28 , respectively. The movement in the effective income tax rate was primarily driven by the settlement with the CFPB in the current quarter of which a portion was not deductible for tax and the impact of a portion of the goodwill impairment recorded in the current quarter not being deductible. 

We repurchased 2.1 million and 4.2 million shares of our common stock during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. As a result of repurchases, our average outstanding diluted shares decreased by 13 million common shares (or 11 from the year-ago period. 

GAAP Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Results with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 107 million, or 0.95 diluted earnings per common share, compared with net income of 256 million, or 2.04 diluted earnings per common share, for the year-ago period. 
 The primary contributors to the change in net income are as follows: 
 Net interest income decreased by 301 million primarily as a result of the paydown of the FFELP and Private Education Loan portfolios. In particular, the FFELP Loan portfolio experienced a 3.1 billion increase in prepayments 5.0 billion in the current period compared with 1.9 billion in the year-ago period), primarily as a result of the Department of Education's proposed debt relief regulations. The current period s increase in prepayments resulted in the write-off of an additional 35 million of loan premium compared to the year-ago period. Additionally, the year-ago period had a 48 million benefit related to a decrease in the speed of loan premium amortization in connection with the continued extension of a portion of the FFELP Loan portfolio. These two items resulted in premium amortization being 83 million higher in the current period compared to the prior period. There was also a decrease in net interest income due to the maturity of Floor Income hedges related to the FFELP Loan portfolio as well as the impact of increasing interest rates on the different index resets for the FFELP Loan assets and debt. These decreases were partially offset by an 18 million decrease in mark-to-market losses on fair value hedges recorded in interest expense. 

Provisions for loan losses remained unchanged at 68 million: 

o The provision for FFELP Loan losses decreased 57 million from 51 million to (6) million. 

o The provision for Private Education Loan losses increased 57 million from 17 million to 74 million. 

The provision for FFELP Loan losses of (6) million in the current period was the result of relatively stable credit trends and elevated prepayment activity over the prior year. See the three-month discussion of results above for the driver of the prior period s provision being significantly higher than the current period. 
 The provision for Private Education Loan losses of 74 million in the current period included 21 million related to changes in the net charge-off rates on defaulted loans, 26 million in connection with loan originations and 27 million related to a general reserve build. The provision of 17 million in the year-ago period included 29 million related to changes in the net charge-off rates on defaulted loans, 21 million in connection with loan originations, 23 million in connection with the resolution of certain private legacy loans in bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2023 and 7 million related to a reserve build, which was partially offset by a 63 million reduction in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard (ASU 2022-02). 
 A gain of 219 million was recognized in the current period from the sale of 100 of our equity interests for 369 million cash, on September 19, 2024, of Xtend Healthcare, our healthcare services business. 

Asset recovery and business processing revenue decreased 12 million primarily as a result of a decrease in our government services revenue related to congressional funding not being approved to continue performing services under a particular contract. 

Net gains on derivative and hedging activities decreased 33 million, primarily due to interest rate fluctuations. Valuations of derivative instruments fluctuate based upon many factors including changes in interest rates and other market factors. As a result, net gains and losses on derivative and hedging activities may vary significantly in future periods. 

12 

Operating expenses decreased 68 million primarily due to a decrease in the business processing segment expenses as a result of the government services contract discussed above, as well as several efficiency initiatives recently implemented and the year-ago period having elevated upfront start-up costs on new contracts. In addition there was lower in-school loan marketing spend as a result of improved marketing efficiencies and a reduction in regulatory expenses. 

Goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment and amortization expense increased by 137 million as a result of a 138 million impairment recognized in the current period related to our government services business. See the three-month discussion of results above for further detail. 

Restructuring and other reorganization expenses increased 12 million due to an increase in severance-related costs. The current period s restructuring and other reorganization expenses of 35 million included 25 million of severance-related costs in connection with the various strategic initiatives being implemented to simplify the company, reduce our expense base and enhance our flexibility. 

We repurchased 7.2 million and 13.9 million shares of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. As a result of repurchases, our average outstanding diluted shares decreased by 13 million common shares (or 10 from the year-ago period.

Comparison of Third-Quarter 2024 Results with Third-Quarter 2023 
 Net income was 27 million compared to 94 million. 

Net interest income decreased 121 million primarily due to the year-ago quarter having a 48 million benefit related to a decrease in the speed of loan premium amortization in connection with the continued extension of a portion of the portfolio. There was also a decrease in net interest income due to the maturity of Floor Income hedges related to the portfolio, the impact of increased interest rates on the different index resets for the segment's assets and debt, and the paydown of the loan portfolio which included an increase in prepayments from 600 million in the year-ago quarter to 1.0 billion in the current quarter. 

Provision for loan losses decreased 41 million. The (5) million of provision for loan losses in third-quarter 2024 was the result of relatively stable credit trends and elevated prepayment activity over the prior year. The 36 million of provision in the year-ago quarter was primarily a result of the continued extension of the portfolio and the resulting increase in both the expected future defaults and the premium allocated to all expected future defaults. 

o Net charge-offs were 9 million compared to 16 million. 

o Delinquencies greater than 90 days were 1.9 billion compared to 2.9 billion. 

o Forbearances were 5.0 billion compared to 6.2 billion. 

Expenses were 3 million higher primarily as a result of transitioning the servicing of our portfolio to a third party on July 1, 2024. Overall, for consolidated Navient (across the Federal Education Loans, Consumer Lending and Other segments), there was a 1 million increase in net servicing costs (net of transition services revenue earned) in the current quarter related to this transition, as expected. Over the remaining life of the portfolio, we expect a significant overall cost savings to be realized.

The 106 basis point decrease in the net interest margin is primarily due to the year-ago quarter having a 48 million benefit (56 basis points) related to a decrease in the speed of loan premium amortization in connection with the continued extension of a portion of the portfolio. There was also a decrease in net interest income due to the maturity of Floor Income hedges related to the portfolio and the impact of increasing interest rates on the different index resets for the segment s assets and debt (31 basis points in total). 
 As of September 30, 2024, our FFELP Loan portfolio totaled 31.5 billion, comprised of 11.3 billion of FFELP Stafford Loans and 20.2 billion of FFELP Consolidation Loans. The weighted-average life of these portfolios as of September 30, 2024 was 8 years and 7 years, respectively, assuming a Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR) of 7 and 5 , respectively.

Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses for the Federal Education Loans segment primarily include costs incurred to perform servicing on our FFELP Loan portfolio and federal education loans held by other institutions. Expenses were 3 million higher primarily as a result of transitioning the servicing of our portfolio to a third party on July 1, 2024. Overall for consolidated Navient (across the Federal Education Loan, Consumer Lending and Other segments), there was a 1 million increase in net servicing costs (net of transition services revenue earned) in the current quarter related to this transition, as expected. Over the remaining life of the portfolio, we expect a significant overall cost savings to be realized. 
 Various Federal Loan Forgiveness Plans 
 On August 24, 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration announced its Student Debt Relief (SDR) Plan. The SDR Plan would have provided up to 20,000 in one-time debt relief to income-qualified recipients with ED held student loans and a repayment pause on ED held loans. Privately held FFELP Loans, like ours, were not eligible for debt forgiveness. 
 A number of states and private organizations initiated legal challenges to the SDR Plan in various courts throughout the country. On June 30, 2023, the Supreme Court ruled that ED was prohibited from implementing the SDR Plan, and student loan payments on ED held loans resumed in October 2023. After the invalidation of the SDR Plan, ED introduced various debt relief programs and processes aimed at considering other ways to provide debt relief to borrowers, which could include borrowers with privately held FFELP Loans. This included the issuance of final regulations on income-driven repayment plans for Direct loans, which are student loans held by ED. Eligible FFELP borrowers could access the new income-driven repayment plans by consolidating their loans into the Direct Loan Program. 
 The proposed borrower debt relief regulations, including the new income-driven repayment plans, have increased, and may continue to increase, consolidation activity in the future as FFELP borrowers consolidate their loans into the Direct Loan Program in order to be eligible for potential debt relief and the new income-driven repayment plan. This consolidation activity could have a material impact on the Company s results. 
 Several lawsuits have been filed or announced (to which Navient is not a party) seeking to overturn these regulations. We cannot predict the final outcome of this litigation or what impact the litigation may have on borrower consolidation activity.

Net Interest Loss after Provision for Loan Losses 
 Net interest loss after provision for loan losses is due to the negative carrying cost of our corporate liquidity portfolio. The amount of the net interest loss is primarily a result of the size of the liquidity portfolio as well as the cost of funds of the debt funding the corporate liquidity portfolio. 
 Unallocated Shared Services Operating Expenses 
 Unallocated shared services operating expenses are costs primarily related to information technology costs related to infrastructure and operations, stock-based compensation expense, accounting, finance, legal, compliance and risk management, regulatory-related expenses, human resources, certain executive management and the Board of Directors. Regulatory-related expenses include actual settlement amounts as well as third-party professional fees we incur in connection with such regulatory matters and are presented net of any insurance reimbursements for covered costs related to such matters. Expenses decreased 36 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of a 33 million decrease in regulatory-related expenses. Regulatory-related expenses were 14 million and 47 million in third-quarter 2024 and third-quarter 2023, respectively, with third-quarter 2024 including an 18 million contingency loss accrual related to the 120 million settlement agreement entered into with the CFPB in September 2024. Third-quarter 2023 included a 45 million contingency loss accrual related to the same matter. 
 See Note 10 Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees for a discussion of legal and regulatory matters where it is reasonably possible that a loss contingency exists. The Company is unable to anticipate the timing of a resolution or the impact that certain matters may have on the Company s consolidated financial position, liquidity, results of operation or cash flows. As a result, it is not possible at this time to estimate a range of potential exposure, if any, for amounts that may be payable in connection with certain matters and reserves have not been established. It is possible that an adverse ruling or rulings may have a material adverse impact on the Company. 
 Restructuring/Other Reorganization Expenses 
 These expenses increased 14 million. The current quarter s restructuring and other reorganization expenses of 18 million included 13 million of severance-related costs in connection with the various strategic initiatives being implemented to simplify the Company, reduce our expense base and enhance our flexibility, and primarily related to severance costs.

(1) Charge-offs are reported net of expected recoveries. For Private Education Loans, we charge off the estimated loss of a defaulted loan balance by charging off the entire defaulted loan balance and estimating recoveries on a pool basis. These estimated recoveries are referred to as expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans. For FFELP Loans, the recovery is received at the time of charge-off. 

(2) In third-quarter 2023, the net charge-off rate on defaulted Private Education Loans increased from 81.9 to 82.3 and in third-quarter 2024, it increased from 82.3 to 82.7 . These changes resulted in a 21 million and 25 million reduction to the balance of the expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans in third-quarter 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

(3) At the end of each month, for Private Education Loans that are 212 or more days past due, we charge off the estimated loss of a defaulted loan balance by charging off the entire loan balance and estimating recoveries on a pool basis. These estimated recoveries are referred to as "expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans." If actual periodic recoveries are less than expected, the difference is immediately reflected as a reduction to expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans. If actual periodic recoveries are greater than expected, they will be reflected as a recovery through the allowance for Private Education Loan losses once the cumulative recovery amount exceeds the cumulative amount originally expected to be recovered. The following table summarizes the activity in the expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans:

L iquidity and Capital Resources 
 Funding and Liquidity Risk Management 
 The following Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion concentrates primarily on our Federal Education Loans and Consumer Lending segments. Our Business Processing segment requires minimal liquidity and funding. 
 We define liquidity as cash and high-quality liquid assets that we can use to meet our cash requirements. Our two primary liquidity needs are: (1) servicing our debt and (2) our ongoing ability to meet our cash needs for running the operations of our businesses (including derivative collateral requirements) throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress. Secondary liquidity needs, which can be adjusted as needed, include the origination of Private Education Loans, acquisitions of Private Education Loan and FFELP Loan portfolios, acquisitions of companies, the payment of common stock dividends and the repurchase of our common stock. To achieve these objectives, we analyze and monitor our liquidity needs and maintain excess liquidity and access to diverse funding sources including the issuance of unsecured debt and the issuance of secured debt primarily through asset-backed securitizations and/or other financing facilities. 
 We define our liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our obligations when they become due without incurring unacceptable losses or to invest in future asset growth and business operations at reasonable market rates. Our primary liquidity risk relates to our ability to service our debt, meet our other business obligations and to continue to grow our business. The ability to access the capital markets is impacted by general market and economic conditions, our credit ratings, as well as the overall availability of funding sources in the marketplace. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter derivatives. 
 Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and may change, from time to time, based on our financial performance, industry and market dynamics and other factors. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include the rating agencies assessment of the general operating environment, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position and capital management practices. A negative change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity because it might raise the cost and availability of funding and potentially require additional cash collateral or restrict cash currently held as collateral on existing borrowings or derivative collateral arrangements. It is our objective to improve our credit ratings so that we can continue to efficiently access the capital markets even in difficult economic and market conditions. We have unsecured debt totaling 5.9 billion at September 30, 2024. Three credit rating agencies currently rate our long-term unsecured debt at below investment grade. 
 We expect to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, including the repayment of 1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes that mature in the short term (i.e., over the next 12 months) and the remaining 4.8 billion of senior unsecured notes that mature in the long term (from 2025 to 2043 with 56 maturing by 2029), through a number of sources. These sources include our cash on hand, unencumbered FFELP Loan and Private Education Refinance Loan portfolios (see Sources of Primary Liquidity below), the predictable operating cash flows provided by operating activities, the repayment of principal on unencumbered education loan assets, and the distribution of overcollateralization from our securitization trusts. We may also, depending on market conditions and availability, draw down on our secured FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) facilities, issue term ABS, enter into additional Private Education Loan and FFELP Loan ABS repurchase facilities, or issue additional unsecured debt. 
 We originate Private Education Loans (a portion of which is obtained through a forward purchase agreement). We also have purchased and may purchase, in future periods, Private Education Loan portfolios from third parties. Loan originations and purchases are part of our ongoing liquidity needs. We purchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for 33 million in the third quarter of 2024 and have 176 million of unused share repurchase authority as of September 30, 2024.

At September 30, 2024, we had a total of 3.5 billion of unencumbered tangible assets inclusive of those listed in the table above as sources of primary liquidity. Total unencumbered education loans comprised 1.4 billion principal of our unencumbered tangible assets of which 1.2 billion and 199 million related to Private Education Loans and FFELP Loans, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had 4.9 billion of encumbered net assets (i.e., overcollateralization) in our various financing facilities (consolidated variable interest entities). We enter into repurchase facilities at times to borrow against the encumbered net assets of these financing vehicles. As of September 30, 2024, 0.8 billion of repurchase facility borrowings were outstanding.

C ritical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). A discussion of our critical accounting policies, which includes the allowance for loan losses, goodwill impairment assessment, premium and discount amortization, and the impact of the SDR Plan on our accounting policies and estimates, can be found in our 2023 Form 10-K. See "Segment Results Federal Education Loans Segment Various Federal Loan Forgiveness Plans" for an update on the SDR Plan. 
 Related to goodwill, we last performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test by engaging an independent appraiser to estimate the fair values of our reporting units as of October 1, 2022. During third-quarter 2024, we assessed relevant qualitative factors associated with the FFELP Loans and Government Services reporting units to determine whether it was "more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying values. Based on the current performance of and economic environment impacting the other reporting units with goodwill, we determined that neither a qualitative nor a quantitative interim impairment test was warranted to test goodwill associated with other reporting units. 
 For the FFELP Loans reporting unit, goodwill will be impaired at some point in the future due to the runoff nature of the portfolio, although the timing of impairment remains uncertain. As a result of elevated prepayments experienced in the first nine months of 2024 (primarily as a result of ED's proposed debt relief regulations), the runoff nature of the portfolio and the passage of time, we performed a quantitative impairment test, by engaging an independent appraiser to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. FFELP Loan s goodwill was not deemed impaired as a result of the quantitative impairment test as the fair value of the reporting unit was greater than the reporting unit s carry value. However, our current projections of future cash flows would result in partial impairment of FFELP Loans in 2025 earlier than previously estimated (as previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K) and impairment may be accelerated into the fourth quarter of 2024 if elevated prepayment rates continue or if there is significant change in economic and other factors impacting the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the projected cashflows and thus the reporting unit. Since our estimate of future portfolio cash flows may change, the estimated timing of partial future impairment may also change. 
 With respect to the Government Services reporting unit, in the second half of September 2024, we were informed a contract that represented a significant portion of Government Services income would not be renewed in 2025. In addition, a federal program which is a significant part of a Government Services contract remained unfunded during the third quarter. There has been increased uncertainty as to when or if there will be congressional approval to fund this program which would result in the resumption of services provided by Government Services under this contract. These two events in September 2024 resulted in a significant decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Based on active discussions with potential buyers of the Government Services business and their indication of a potential purchase price, Navient concluded that Government Services 138 million of goodwill and acquired intangible assets were fully impaired. The remaining net book value of the Government Services reporting unit after the impairment was approximately 50 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 As it relates to our Business Processing Healthcare Services reporting unit, on September 19, 2024, Navient completed the sale of its membership interest in Xtend, LLC, which comprised the Company's healthcare services business, resulting in a 219 million gain on sale. As a result, 112 million of goodwill and acquired intangible assets were a part of our basis in this entity, and these assets were therefore removed from our balance sheet upon the sale.

N on-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to financial results reported on a GAAP basis, Navient also provides certain performance measures which are non-GAAP financial measures. We present the following non-GAAP financial measures: (1) Core Earnings, (2) Tangible Equity (as well as the Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio), (3) EBITDA for the Business Processing segment, and (4) Allowance for Loan Losses Excluding Expected Future Recoveries on Previously Fully Charged-off Loans. Definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are provided below, except that reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not provided because the Company is unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and financial impact of certain items, including, but not limited to, the impact of any mark-to-market gains/losses resulting from our use of derivative instruments to hedge our economic risks. 
 1. Core Earnings 
 We prepare financial statements and present financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments and present financial results on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as Core Earnings. We provide this Core Earnings basis of presentation on a consolidated basis and for each business segment because this is what we review internally when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources. We also refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. Because our Core Earnings basis of presentation corresponds to our segment financial presentations, we are required by GAAP to provide certain Core Earnings disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our business segments. 
 Core Earnings are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP. We use Core Earnings to manage our business segments because Core Earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP financial results for two items, discussed below, that can create significant volatility mostly due to timing factors generally beyond the control of management. Accordingly, we believe that Core Earnings provide management with a useful basis from which to better evaluate results from ongoing operations against the business plan or against results from prior periods. Consequently, we disclose this information because we believe it provides investors with additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. When compared to GAAP results, the two items we remove to result in our Core Earnings presentations are: 
 (1) Mark-to-market gains/losses resulting from our use of derivative instruments to hedge our economic risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or do qualify for hedge accounting treatment but result in ineffectiveness; and 

(2) The accounting for goodwill and acquired intangible assets. 

While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, our Core Earnings basis of presentation does not. Core Earnings are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our Core Earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Accordingly, our Core Earnings presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not be able to compare our performance with that of other financial services companies based upon Core Earnings. Core Earnings results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, our Board of Directors, credit rating agencies, lenders and investors to assess performance. 
 30 

The following tables show our consolidated GAAP results, Core Earnings results (including for each reportable segment) along with the adjustments made to the income/expense items to reconcile the consolidated GAAP results to the Core Earnings results as required by GAAP and reported in Note 12 Segment Reporting.

(1) Derivative Accounting: Core Earnings exclude periodic gains and losses that are caused by the mark-to-market valuations on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under GAAP, as well as the periodic mark-to-market gains and losses that are a result of ineffectiveness recognized related to effective hedges under GAAP. Under GAAP, for our derivatives that are held to maturity, the mark-to-market gain or loss over the life of the contract will equal 0 except for Floor Income Contracts, where the mark-to-market gain will equal the amount for which we originally sold the contract. In our Core Earnings presentation, we recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which generally results in any net settlement cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an interest expense or revenue over the hedged item s life. 
 The accounting for derivatives requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings, with no fair value adjustment of the hedged item, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The gains and losses recorded in Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net and interest expense (for qualifying fair value hedges) are primarily caused by interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges, and as such, are a critical element of our interest rate and foreign currency risk management strategy. However, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts, basis swaps and at times, certain other interest rate swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and the stand-alone derivative is adjusted to fair value in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. See our 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion.

(1) Derivative accounting requires net settlement income/expense on derivatives that do not qualify as hedges to be recorded in a separate income statement line item below net interest income. Under our Core Earnings presentation, these settlements are reclassified to the income statement line item of the economically hedged item. For our Core Earnings net interest income, this would primarily include (a) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to our Floor Income Contracts to education loan interest income and (b) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to certain of our interest rate swaps to debt interest expense. The table below summarizes these net settlements on derivative and hedging activities and the associated reclassification on a Core Earnings basis.

Cumulative Impact of Derivative Accounting under GAAP compared to Core Earnings 
 As of September 30, 2024, derivative accounting decreased GAAP equity by approximately 37 million as a result of cumulative net mark-to-market losses (after tax) recognized under GAAP, but not in Core Earnings. The following table rolls forward the cumulative impact to GAAP equity due to these after-tax mark-to-market net gains and losses related to derivative accounting.

Hedging Embedded Floor Income 
 We use Floor Income Contracts, pay-fixed swaps and fixed rate debt to economically hedge embedded Floor Income in our FFELP Loans. Historically, we have used these instruments on a periodic basis and depending upon market conditions and pricing, we may enter into additional hedges in the future. Under GAAP, the Floor Income Contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and the pay-fixed swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The table below shows the amount of hedged Floor Income that will be recognized in Core Earnings in future periods based on these hedge strategies.

2. Tangible Equity and Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio 
 Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio measures the ratio of Navient s Tangible Equity to its tangible assets. We adjust this ratio to exclude the assets and equity associated with our FFELP Loan portfolio because FFELP Loans are no longer originated and the FFELP Loan portfolio bears a 3 maximum loss exposure under the terms of the federal guaranty. Management believes that excluding this portfolio from the ratio enhances its usefulness to investors. Management uses this ratio, in addition to other metrics, for analysis and decision making related to capital allocation decisions. The Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio is calculated as:

4. Allowance for Loan Losses Excluding Expected Future Recoveries on Previously Fully Charged-off 
 Loans 
 The allowance for loan losses on the Private Education Loan portfolio used for the three credit metrics below excludes the expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans to better reflect the current expected credit losses remaining in connection with the loans on balance sheet that have not charged off. That is, as of September 30, 2024, the 656 million Private Education Loan allowance for loan losses excluding expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans represents the current expected credit losses that remain in connection with the 16,476 million Private Education Loan portfolio. The 185 million of expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans, which is collected over an average 15-year period, mechanically is a reduction to the overall allowance for loan losses. However, it is not related to the 16,476 million Private Education Loan portfolio on our balance sheet and, as a result, management excludes this impact to the allowance to better evaluate and assess our overall credit loss coverage on the Private Education Loan portfolio. We believe this provides a more meaningful and holistic view of the available credit loss coverage on our non-charged-off Private Education Loan portfolio. We believe this information is useful to our investors, lenders and rating agencies .

Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 
 Our interest rate risk management seeks to limit the impact of movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position. The following tables summarize the potential effect on earnings over the next 12 months and the potential effect on fair values of balance sheet assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024 and 2023, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase and decrease in market interest rates of 100 basis points. The earnings sensitivities assume an immediate increase and decrease in market interest rates of 100 basis points and are applied only to financial assets and liabilities, including hedging instruments, that existed at the balance sheet date and do not take into account any new assets, liabilities or hedging instruments that may arise over the next 12 months.

A primary objective in our funding is to minimize our sensitivity to changing interest rates by generally funding our floating rate education loan portfolio with floating rate debt and our fixed rate education loan portfolio with fixed rate debt although we can have a mismatch at times. In addition, we can have a mismatch in the index (including the frequency of reset) of floating rate debt versus floating rate assets. In addition, due to the ability of some FFELP Loans to earn Floor Income, we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding if the education loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating. We use Floor Income Contracts, pay-fixed swaps and fixed rate debt to economically hedge embedded Floor Income in our FFELP Loans. Historically, we have used these instruments on a periodic basis and depending upon market conditions and pricing, we may enter into additional hedges in the future. The result of these hedging transactions is to fix the relative spread between the education loan asset rate and the funding instrument rate. 
 In the preceding tables, under the scenario where interest rates increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the change in pre-tax net income before the mark-to-market gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is primarily due to the impact of (i) a portion of our unhedged FFELP Loans being in a fixed-rate mode due to Floor Income, while being funded with variable rate debt; (ii) certain FFELP fixed rate loans becoming variable interest rate loans when variable interest rates rise above a certain level (Special Allowance Payment or SAP ). When these loans are funded with fixed rate debt (as we do for a portion of the portfolio to economically hedge Floor Income) we earn additional interest income when earning the higher variable rate that is in effect; and (iii) a portion of our variable rate assets being funded with fixed rate liabilities. Item (i) will generally cause income to decrease when interest rates increase and income to increase when interest rates decrease. Item (ii) and (iii) have the opposite effect. The change due to the interest rate scenario where interest rates increase by 100 basis points in the current period is primarily a result of item (i) having a more significant impact than item (ii) and (iii) as a result of interest rates being lower compared to the prior period. The change due to the interest scenario where interest rates decrease by 100 basis points in the current period is primarily a result of item (i) having a more significant impact than item (ii) and (iii) as a result of interest rates being lower compared to the prior period. The relative changes from the prior period are primarily the result of interest rates being lower in the current period. 
 
 42 

In the preceding tables, under the scenario where interest rates increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the change in mark-to-market gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities in both periods is primarily due to (i) the notional amount and remaining term of our derivative portfolio and related hedged debt and (ii) the interest rate environment. In both periods, the mark-to-market gains (losses) are primarily related to derivatives that don t qualify for hedge accounting that are used to economically hedge the origination of fixed rate Private Education Refinance loans. As a result of not qualifying for hedge accounting, there is not an offsetting mark- to-market of the hedged item in this analysis. 
 In addition to interest rate risk addressed in the preceding tables, we are also exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange risk is primarily the result of foreign currency denominated debt issued by us. When we issue foreign denominated corporate unsecured and securitization debt, our policy is to use cross currency interest rate swaps to swap all foreign currency denominated debt payments (fixed and floating) to USD SOFR using a fixed exchange rate. In the tables above, there would be an immaterial impact on earnings if exchange rates were to decrease or increase, due to the terms of the hedging instrument and hedged items matching. The balance sheet interest-bearing liabilities would be affected by a change in exchange rates; however, the change would be materially offset by the cross-currency interest rate swaps in other assets or other liabilities. In certain economic environments, volatility in the spread between spot and forward foreign exchange rates has resulted in mark-to-market impacts to current period earnings which have not been factored into the above analysis. The earnings impact is noncash, and at maturity of the instruments the cumulative mark-to-market impact will be zero. Navient has not issued foreign currency denominated debt since 2008. 
 Asset and Liability Funding Gap 
 The table below presents our assets and liabilities (funding) arranged by underlying indices as of September 30, 2024. Management analyzes interest rate risk and in doing so includes all derivatives that are economically hedging our debt whether they qualify as effective hedges or not (Core Earnings basis). Accordingly, we present the asset and liability funding gap on a Core Earnings basis. The difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index. This represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude.

(2) The assets are indexed to 30-day average overnight SOFR. A portion of the funding uses the daily average of overnight SOFR from a period preceding the accrual period of the asset ("lookback debt"). Funding includes 14.1 billion of 30-day average SOFR lookback debt and 13.7 billion of 90-day average SOFR lookback debt. 

(3) Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes the obligation to return cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures.

We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. Our asset liability management strategy is to match assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that have the same underlying index and reset frequency or, when economical, have interest rate characteristics that we believe are highly correlated. Interest earned on our FFELP Loans is primarily indexed to 30-day average overnight SOFR reset daily and our cost of funds is primarily indexed to overnight SOFR but resetting at different times than the asset. A source of variability in FFELP net interest income could also be Floor Income we earn on certain FFELP Loans. Pursuant to the terms of the FFELP, certain FFELP Loans can earn interest at the stated fixed rate of interest as underlying debt interest rate expense remains variable. We refer to this additional spread income as Floor Income. Floor Income can be volatile since it is dependent on interest rate levels. We frequently hedge this volatility to lock in the value of the Floor Income over the term of the contract. Interest earned on our Private Education Refinance Loans is generally fixed rate with the related cost of funds generally fixed rate as well. Interest earned on the remaining Private Education Loans is generally indexed to either one-month Prime or term SOFR rates and our cost of funds is primarily indexed to one-month or three-month term SOFR. The use of funding with index types and reset frequencies that are different from our assets exposes us to interest rate risk in the form of basis and repricing risk. This could result in our cost of funds not moving in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the yield on our assets. While we believe this risk is low, as all of these indices are short-term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time, market disruptions (which have occurred in prior years) can lead to a temporary divergence between indices resulting in a negative impact to our earnings.

(1) Charge-offs are reported net of expected recoveries. For Private Education Loans, we charge off the estimated loss of a defaulted loan balance by charging off the entire defaulted loan balance and estimating recoveries on a pool basis. These estimated recoveries are referred to as "expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans." For FFELP Loans, the recovery is received at the time of charge-off. 

 (2) In third-quarter 2024, the net charge-off rate on defaulted Private Education Loans increased from to . This change resulted in a million reduction to the balance of the expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans. 

 (3) At the end of each month, for Private Education Loans that are 212 days past due, we charge off the estimated loss of a defaulted loan balance by charging off the entire loan balance and estimating recoveries on a pool basis. These estimated recoveries are referred to as expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans. If actual periodic recoveries are less than expected, the difference is immediately reflected as a reduction to expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans. If actual periodic recoveries are greater than expected, they will be reflected as a recovery through the allowance for Private Education Loan losses once the cumulative recovery amount exceeds the cumulative amount originally expected to be recovered. The following table summarizes the activity in the expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans:

(1) Charge-offs are reported net of expected recoveries. For Private Education Loans, we charge off the estimated loss of a defaulted loan balance by charging off the entire defaulted loan balance and estimating recoveries on a pool basis. These estimated recoveries are referred to as "expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans." For FFELP Loans, the recovery is received at the time of charge-off. 

 (2) In third-quarter 2023, the net charge-off rate on defaulted Private Education Loans increased from to . This change resulted in a million reduction to the balance of the expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans. 

 (3) At the end of each month, for Private Education Loans that are 212 days past due, we charge off the estimated loss of a defaulted loan balance by charging off the entire loan balance and estimating recoveries on a pool basis. These estimated recoveries are referred to as expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans. If actual periodic recoveries are less than expected, the difference is immediately reflected as a reduction to expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans. If actual periodic recoveries are greater than expected, they will be reflected as a recovery through the allowance for Private Education Loan losses once the cumulative recovery amount exceeds the cumulative amount originally expected to be recovered. The following table summarizes the activity in the expected future recoveries on previously fully charged-off loans

 over the life of the loan. However, exceptions can be made in cases where borrowers have shown the ability to make a substantial number of monthly principal and interest payments and in those cases borrowers can be granted up to of hardship forbearance over the life of the loan. We offer other administrative forbearances (e.g., death and disability, bankruptcy, military service, and disaster forbearance) that are either required by law (such as the Service members Civil Relief Act) or are considered separate from our active loss mitigation programs and therefore are not considered to be loan modifications requiring disclosure under ASU No. 2022-02. FFELP Loans are at least percent guaranteed as to their principal and accrued interest by the federal government in the event of default and, therefore, we do not deem FFELP Loans as nonperforming from a credit risk perspective at any point in their life cycle prior to claim payment and continue to accrue interest on those loans through the date of claim. Further, FFELP loan modification events are either legal entitlements subject to regulatory-driven eligibility criteria or addressed in the promissory note terms, so we do not consider these events as a component of our loan modification programs.

We last performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test by engaging an independent appraiser to estimate the fair values of these reporting units as of October 1, 2022. During the third quarter of 2024, we assessed relevant qualitative factors associated with the FFELP Loans and Government Services reporting units to determine whether it was "more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying values. Based on this qualitative assessment, we performed a quantitative impairment test to determine whether the fair values of these reporting units exceed their carry values. Based on the current performance of and economic environment impacting the other reporting units with goodwill as illustrated in the table above, we determined that neither a qualitative nor a quantitative interim impairment test was warranted to test goodwill associated with these reporting units. For the FFELP Loans reporting unit, goodwill will be impaired at some point in the future due to the runoff nature of the portfolio although the timing of impairment remains uncertain. As a result of elevated prepayments experienced in the first nine months of 2024 (primarily as a result of ED's proposed debt relief regulations), the runoff nature of the portfolio and the passage of time, we performed a quantitative impairment test by engaging an independent appraiser to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. The independent appraiser used an income approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit measuring the value of future economic benefit determined based on the reporting unit s discounted cash flows derived from our portfolio cash flow projections. Under our guidance, the third-party appraisal firm developed the discount rate for the reporting unit incorporating such factors as the risk-free rate, a market rate of return, a measure of volatility (Beta) and a company-specific and capital markets risk premium, as appropriate, to adjust for volatility and uncertainty in the economy and to capture specific risk related to the reporting unit. The discount rate reflects market-based estimates of capital costs and is adjusted for our assessment of a market participant s view with respect to execution, source concentration and other risks associated with the projected cash flows of the reporting unit. We reviewed and approved the discount rate provided by the third-party appraiser including the factors incorporated to develop the discount rate for the FFELP Loans reporting unit. FFELP Loans goodwill was not deemed impaired as a result of the quantitative impairment test as the fair value of the reporting unit was greater than the reporting unit s carry value. However, our current projections of future cash flows would result in partial impairment of FFELP goodwill in 2025 earlier than previously estimated (as previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K), and impairment may be accelerated into the fourth quarter of 2024 if elevated prepayment rates continue or if there is significant change in economic and other factors impacting the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the projected cashflows and thus the reporting unit. Since our estimate of future portfolio cash flows may change, the estimated timing of partial future impairment may also change.

 State Attorneys General to resolve all matters in dispute related to the State Attorneys General cases as well as the related investigations, subpoenas, civil investigative demands and inquiries from various other state regulators. Due to developments in the second half of 2023 and the first half of 2024 in connection with the Company's CFPB matter, the Company concluded a loss was probable and reasonably estimable. As of June 30, 2024, the contingency loss liability was million. Navient reached an agreement to settle the CFPB lawsuit in September 2024. While we do not agree with the CFPB s allegations, this resolution is consistent with our go-forward activities and is an important positive milestone in our transformation of the Company. As part of the settlement, pursuant to which the Company did not admit to any wrongdoing, Navient agreed to pay million, which includes a million payment that will be used by the CFPB to make payments to certain borrowers as determined by the CFPB, in addition to a million penalty. In light of the contingency loss liability established in the amount of million as of June 30, 2024, there was an additional million of contingency expense recorded in third-quarter 2024. The million was paid prior to September 30, 2024. The settlement prohibits Navient from servicing federal student loans (other than in the role as master servicer of Navient s FFELP Loan portfolio), and further prohibits Navient from purchasing any FFELP Loans in the future. These restrictions are not expected to have a material impact on Navient s business as Navient had already exited its Direct loan servicing contract with the Department of Education in 2021, and entered into an agreement with MOHELA to service Navient s FFELP Loan portfolio in May 2024. It is not anticipated that the other requirements of the settlement will impact Navient s go-forward business plans or operations.

Exhibit 10.1 
 AGREEMENT AND RELEASE 
 
 Navient Corporation and its subsidiaries, predecessors, and affiliates (collectively Navient and I, Mark L. Heleen , have reached the following understanding and agreement regarding the termination of my employment effective July 31, 2024 Termination Date ). In exchange for the Plan Benefits and other consideration listed below, I agree to comply fully with the terms of this Agreement and Release Agreement and Release ). 
 
 Any non-disclosure provision in the Agreement and Release does not prohibit or restrict me (or my attorney) from initiating communications directly with, or responding to any inquiry from, or providing testimony before, any self-regulatory organization or state or federal regulatory authority, regarding this release or its underlying facts or circumstances. Any cooperation provision in the Agreement and Release does not require me to contact Navient regarding the subject matter of any such communications before engaging in such communications. 
 
 In exchange for my agreement, Navient agrees to provide me with the Plan Benefits and other consideration listed below, to which I am not otherwise entitled. 
 
 (1) Plan Benefits: Unless I have revoked this Agreement and Release pursuant to Section (8) below, pursuant to the Navient Corporation Executive Severance Plan for Senior Officers Plan ), Navient will pay me severance in the following manner: A total amount of 1,370,425 less withholding taxes and other deductions required by law (the Plan Benefits ). Such payment will be made in a single lump sum payment as soon as practicable following the 7-day revocation period described in Section (8) below and no later than the sixtieth calendar day after my Termination Date, subject in all cases to the provisions of the Plan. 
 
 (a) Rehiring: If I am rehired as an employee of Navient or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates within the 12-month period following my termination, I hereby agree to repay the Plan Benefits within 30 days of rehiring, as a condition of rehire to Navient. The amount of repayment will be calculated by dividing the Plan Benefits by 12 and multiplying that figure by the number of months remaining in the 12-month period following my termination, adjusted, and reduced by the amount of taxes paid and withheld on that sum. 
 
 (b) Medical/Dental/Vision Continuation: My current medical, dental and vision coverage will continue through the end of the month in which my Termination Date occurs. The first day of the month following July 31, 2024, I may be eligible to continue my current medical, dental and vision coverage through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act COBRA ). If I become eligible for coverage under any other group health plan, I may not be eligible for Navient COBRA coverage. If I am eligible and I properly elect COBRA continuation coverage, Navient will subsidize my coverage by paying the employer portion of the total cost of my medical, dental and vision insurance premiums for the period of August 01, 2024 through January 31, 2026. My right to continue medical, dental and/or vision coverage may extend for a maximum period of 18 months under COBRA. 
 
 (c) Benefit Programs: I waive future coverage and benefits under all Navient disability programs, but this Agreement and Release does not affect my eligibility for other Navient medical, dental, vision, life insurance, retirement, and other benefit plans. Whether I sign this Agreement and Release or not, I understand that my rights and continued participation in those plans will be governed by their terms, and that I generally will become ineligible for them shortly after my 

termination, after which I may be able to purchase continued coverage under certain of such plans. I understand that, except for the benefits that may be due under the deferred compensation, equity or 401(k) savings plans to which I may be entitled under Navient s standard employee benefit plans for similarly situated employees and executives, I will not receive any other wage, paid time off, or other similar payments from Navient or any of the entities discussed in Section (2). 
 
 Subject to any earlier payment provisions set forth above, and except for the benefits and payments described in 1(b) (Medical/Dental/Vision continuation) and 1(c) (Benefit Programs), all payments or reimbursements described in this Section (1) shall be paid to me no earlier than the eighth calendar day after my signature on this Agreement and Release, and not later than the sixtieth calendar day after my Termination Date. 
 
 (2) Release: In consideration of the Plan Benefits described above, I agree to release Navient, its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and related companies, and all of its former and current officers, employees, directors, and employee benefit programs (and the trustees, administrators, fiduciaries, and insurers of such programs) such entities (collectively, Released Parties from all actions, charges, claims, demands, damages or liabilities of any kind or character whatsoever, known or unknown, which I now have or may have had through the date I sign this Agreement and Release, except claims that the law does not permit me to waive by signing this Agreement and Release.

 Except with respect to the proviso in Section (2) regarding alleged securities violations and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, and subject to any legal restrictions, I hereby waive and release any right to receive any personal relief (for example, money) as a result of any investigation or proceeding of the U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of Education OIG, EEOC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or any federal, state, or local government agency or court, to the maximum extent permitted by law. 
 
 (4) Additional Representations and Promises: I further acknowledge and agree that: 

(a) I agree to return the following Navient and Released Parties property: office key and America Express corporate card. I will return my ID badge at the conclusion of the consulting arrangement set forth herein. 
 
 (b) I have disclosed to Navient any information I have concerning any conduct involving Navient that I have reason to believe may be unlawful or that involves any false claims to the United States. Other than such disclosures, I hereby represent and warrant that I have not reported any illegal or potentially illegal conduct or activities to any supervisor, manager, department head, human resources representative, director, officer, agent, or any other representative of Navient, any member of the legal or compliance departments, or to the Code of Business Conduct hotline and have no knowledge of any such illegal or potentially illegal conduct or activities. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and Release and the law, I promise to cooperate fully in any investigation Navient undertakes into matters occurring during my employment with Navient. I understand that nothing in this Agreement and Release prevents me from cooperating with any U.S. government investigation. In addition, to the fullest extent permitted by law, I hereby irrevocably assign to the U.S. government any right I might have to any proceeds or awards in connection with any false claims proceedings against Navient. 
 
 (c) If I breach any provisions of this Agreement and Release, I agree that I will pay for all costs incurred by any of the Released Parties, or any entities or individuals covered by this Agreement and Release, including reasonable attorneys fees, in defending against my claim and seeking to uphold my release. 
 
 (d) Until the earliest to occur of the date on which the Company files (i) this Agreement and Release with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to a Form 10-Q or an exhibit to a Form 8-k or (ii) the Company s proxy statement for the fiscal year 2024 disclosing the material terms of this Agreement and Release, I agree to keep the financial terms of this Agreement and Release completely confidential except as may be required or permitted by statute, regulation, or court order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, I may disclose such information to my immediate family and professional representatives and advisors, so long as they are informed and agree to be bound by this confidentiality clause. This Agreement and Release shall not be offered or received in evidence in any action or proceeding in any court, arbitration, administrative agency, or other tribunal for any purpose whatsoever other than to carry out or enforce the provisions of this Agreement and Release, except as required by law. 
 
 (e) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and Release and the law, I agree not to defame or maliciously disparage Navient, its business practices, products, and services, any of the Released Parties, or any other entity or person covered by this Agreement and Release. 
 
 (f) I understand that Navient in the future may change employee benefits or pay. I 
 understand that my job may be refilled. 
 
 (g) I have not suffered any job-related wrongs or injuries, such as any type of discrimination, for which I might still be entitled to compensation or relief in the future. I have properly reported all hours that I have worked, and I have been paid all wages, overtime, commissions, compensation, benefits, and other amounts that Navient or any of the Released Parties should have paid me in the past, other than with respect to any benefit plan termination or distributions authorized as of the date of this Agreement and Release. I have received from Navient and Released Parties all rights and benefits, if any, potentially due to me pursuant to the FMLA or any applicable state or local leave laws. 

(h) I intentionally am releasing claims that I do not know I might have and that, with hindsight, I might regret having released. I have not assigned or given away any of the claims that I am releasing. 
 
 (i) If Navient or I successfully assert that any provision in this Agreement and Release is void, the rest of the Agreement and Release shall remain valid and enforceable unless the other party to this Agreement and Release elects to cancel it. If this Agreement and Release is cancelled by me, I will repay the Plan Benefits I received for signing it. 
 
 (j) If I initially did not think any representation I am making in this Agreement and Release was true, or if I initially was uncomfortable making it, I resolved all my concerns before signing this Agreement and Release. I have carefully read this Agreement and Release, I fully understand what it means, I am entering it knowingly and voluntarily, and all my representations in it are true. Navient would not have signed this Agreement and Release but for my promises and representations. 
 
 (5) Arbitration of Disputes: Except with respect to the proviso in Section (2) concerning securities litigation, Navient and I agree to resolve any disputes we may have with each other through final and binding arbitration, to the fullest extent permitted by law. For example, I am agreeing to arbitrate any dispute about the validity of this Agreement and Release or any discrimination or retaliation claim, which means that an Arbitrator and not another tribunal will decide issues of arbitrability and of liability with respect to any claim I may bring; provided, however, that either party may pursue a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunctive relief, with expedited discovery where necessary, in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect common law or contractual trade secret or confidential information rights and to enforce the post-employment restrictions in Section (6). I also agree to resolve through final and binding arbitration any disputes I have with Navient, its affiliates, or any current or former officers, employees or directors who elects to arbitrate those disputes under this subsection, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Arbitrations shall be conducted by JAMS (also known as Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services) in accordance with its employment dispute resolution rules. This agreement to arbitrate does not apply to government agency proceedings, but does apply to any action I might bring, including but not limited to any lawsuit related to a government agency proceeding, to the fullest extent permitted by law. By agreeing to this Agreement and Release, I understand that I am waiving my right to a jury trial. 
 
 (6) Confidentiality, Intellectual Property, Non-Competition, and Non-Solicitation: Except as required or permitted by statute, regulation, or court order, or pursuant to written consent given by Navient s General Counsel, I agree not to disclose to anyone else any of the information or materials which are proprietary or trade secrets of Navient or are otherwise confidential. In addition, in consideration of the Plan Benefits, I hereby acknowledge that I previously signed an Agreement Regarding Confidentiality, Intellectual Property and Non-Solicitation Agreement, and that I continue to be bound by the terms of that agreement, the purpose of which is to protect to the maximum extent permitted by law Navient s protectable business interests, except as modified in this Section (6). Nothing in this Agreement and Release shall be construed as prohibiting or otherwise restricting me from lawfully reporting waste, fraud, or abuse related to the performance of a U.S. government contract to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a federal department or agency authorized to receive such information (e.g., an agency Office of the Inspector General), nor does this Agreement and Release prohibit me from communicating with government agencies about possible violations of federal, state, or local laws or otherwise providing information to government agencies, filing a complaint with government agencies, or participating in government agency investigations or proceedings. I am not required to notify Navient of any such communications; provided, however, that nothing herein authorizes the disclosure of information I obtained through a communication that was subject to the attorney-client privilege. I understand that I shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of 

a trade secret that is made (a) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in consideration of the Plan Benefits, I agree as follows: I shall not, directly, or indirectly, compete with Navient or its subsidiaries or affiliates for a period of 12 months after the date of termination of my employment for whatever reason Restricted Period ). For the purposes of this Section (6), compete means working or serving in a business capacity, including but not limited to working or serving as a director, officer, employee, consultant, agent, representative, or in any other business capacity, with or without compensation, on behalf of one or more entities engaged in any business similar to the type of business conducted by Navient at the time my employment with Navient terminated. For purposes of this Section (6), a business similar to the type of business conducted by Navient includes private student loan originations and private student loan refinancings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this provision shall be construed to prevent or limit me from engaging in the practice of law for or on behalf of any business, including, but not limited to, a business engaged in private student loan originations and private student loan refinancings. 
 
 In further consideration of the Plan Benefits described above in this Agreement and Release, I agree that for 18 months after my Termination Date (collectively, the Non-Solicitation Employee Period that I shall not solicit or encourage any employee with whom I communicated within the last year of my employment to leave the employ of Navient or hire any such employees. Further, for a period of 18 months following my Termination Date, I shall not, directly, or indirectly, contact or accept business that Navient could otherwise perform from any of Navient s customers or prospective customers with whom I communicated within the last two (2) years of my employment. For the purposes of this Section (6), business that Navient could otherwise perform includes private student loan originations and private student loan refinancings. 
 
 I expressly agree that the markets served by Navient extend nationally and are not dependent on the geographic location of the personnel or the businesses by which they are employed and that the restrictions set forth in this Section (6) have been designed to be reasonable and are no greater than are required for the protection of Navient and do not prevent me from earning a livelihood by working in positions that do not compete with Navient. In the event that a court shall determine that any provision of the Agreement and Release is unenforceable, the Parties shall request that the court construe this Agreement and Release in such a fashion as to render it enforceable and to revise time, geographic and functional limits to those minimum limits that the court believes are reasonable to protect the interests of Navient. I acknowledge and agree that this covenant has unique, substantial, and immeasurable value to Navient, that I have sufficient skills to provide a livelihood for me while this covenant remains in force, and that this covenant will not interfere with my ability to work consistent with my experience, training, and education. To enable Navient to monitor compliance with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and Release, I further agree to inform in writing Navient s Chief Human Resources Officer of the identity of my subsequent employer(s) and my prospective job title and responsibilities prior to beginning employment. The foregoing notwithstanding, if this information constitutes material non-public information of my subsequent employer, I agree to inform Navient s Chief Human Resources Officer of the identity of my subsequent employer(s) and my job title and responsibilities reasonably promptly after such information is made publicly available by my subsequent employer. I agree that this notice requirement shall remain in effect for twelve (12) months following my Termination Date. 
 
 In the event that the Board of Directors of Navient or its successor reasonably determines that I have violated any of the post-employment restrictions of the Agreement and Release or if a court at my request determines that all or a substantial part of such restrictions are held to be unenforceable, I will return to Navient 50 (less withholdings previously withheld by law) of the Plan Benefits. The illegality, 

unenforceability, or ineffectiveness of any provision of this Section (6) shall not affect the legality, enforceability, or effectiveness of any other provision of this Agreement and Release. Notwithstanding the confidentiality provisions identified in Section 4(d) of this Agreement and Release, I may disclose my Navient restrictive covenants to prospective employers and agree that Navient may provide a copy of this Agreement and Release to my prospective or future employers. 
 
 (7) Review Period: I hereby acknowledge (a) that I initially received a copy of the original draft of this Agreement and Release on or before July 31, 2024 ; (b) that I was offered a period of 45 calendar days to review and consider it; (c) that I understand I could use as much of the 45 calendar day period as I wish prior to signing; and (d) that I am hereby advised of my right to consult an attorney of my own choosing before signing this Agreement and Release, and understand whether or not to do so is my decision. I waive any rights to further time to consider the Agreement and Release. 
 
 (8) Revocation of Claims: I understand that I may revoke the waiver of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) claims made in this Agreement and Release within seven (7) days of my signing. If I exercise this right to revoke, only my waiver and release of claims under the ADEA shall not be effective or enforceable and I will not receive 70 of the Plan Benefits described in Section (1) above. Revocation of claims can be made by delivering a written notice of revocation to Patty McKeown, VP, Chief Human Resources Officer, Navient, 13865 Sunrise Valley Drive, Herndon, VA 20171. 
 
 (9) I acknowledge that I have read and understand all provisions of this Agreement and Release. This Agreement and Release represents the entire agreement between the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof and shall not be altered, amended, modified, or otherwise changed except by a writing executed by both Parties. I understand and agree that this Agreement and Release, with the exception of claims under the ADEA, which may be revoked as set out in Section (8), is final and binding when executed by me. I sign this document freely, knowingly, and voluntarily. I acknowledge that I have not relied upon any representation or statement, written or oral, not set forth in this Agreement and Release. If any provision of this Agreement and Release is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or by an arbitrator to be unenforceable or contrary to law, the remainder of that provision and the remaining provisions of this Agreement and Release will remain in full force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If this Agreement and Release is held to be unenforceable or contrary to law as a result of an action I initiate, I agree to repay the Plan Benefit I received. This Agreement and Release is governed by federal laws and the laws of the State of Delaware. 
 
 (10) In addition, in consideration of the Plan Benefits and other consideration described above, and subject to the provisions of this Agreement and Release and the law, I agree to cooperate with Navient, its affiliates, and its legal counsel in any legal proceedings currently pending or brought in the future against Navient, including, but not limited to: (1) participation as a witness; (2) drafting, producing, and reviewing documents; (3) assisting with interviews, depositions, discovery, hearings, and trial; and (4) contacting Navient. In the event I am requested, with reasonable notice, to travel as part of this litigation cooperation, Navient agrees to pay my reasonable out of pocket expenses. 
 
 (11) Legal Consulting: I further agree to provide legal counsel services to Navient for a period of three months following my termination, including without limitation, consulting on ongoing legal matters and new legal matters Legal Services ). In consideration of the Legal Services I may provide, Navient agrees to pay me a retainer of 20,000 each month for up to 20 hours of Legal Services per month. Navient shall pay this monthly retainer in advance on or before the 1st of each month during the consulting period beginning on August 1, 2024. For each hour of Legal Services, I may provide beyond 20 hours in a given calendar month, Navient agrees to pay me 1,000 per hour for each additional hour. Following the three-month term of this legal consulting agreement, if the Parties mutually agree, I may provide ongoing Legal Services at the rate of 1,000 per hour. 

In addition, Navient shall reimburse me for all reasonable expenses incurred in performing Legal Services, provided that the expenses have been specifically approved in advance by Navient and any expenses related to travel are consistent with Navient s travel policy. 
 
 To the extent I have worked more than the 20 hours per month covered by the monthly retainer or Navient is obligated to reimburse me for any reasonable expenses, I will invoice Navient on a monthly basis, with supporting documentation showing the number of hours worked during each calendar month. Navient shall pay each such invoice within 30 days of receipt. 
 
 The Parties agree that this agreement for Legal Services shall not be construed to establish an employer- employee relationship, nor shall it impact the other consideration I am entitled to receive under this Agreement and Release. The Legal Services I provide shall be covered by the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine, as applicable, and I agree to maintain confidentiality in connection with such Legal Services and related communications. 

Before you sign this Agreement and Release, please take it home, read through each section and carefully consider it. Navient recommends that you discuss with your personal attorney before signing (any personal attorney fees are not covered under the terms of this agreement). You have up to 45 calendar days to consider this Agreement and Release. You may not make any changes to the terms of this Agreement and Release. By signing this Agreement and Release, you will be waiving any claims whether known or unknown. At any point during the 45-day review period described above in Section (7) and before the end of the 7-day revocation period described above in Section (8), Navient may withdraw and rescind this Agreement and Release.
