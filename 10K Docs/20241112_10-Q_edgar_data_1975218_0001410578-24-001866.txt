 to cover certain offering costs of the Company in consideration for Class F ordinary shares, par value per share (the Founder Shares ).

On August 27, 2023, the remainder of the over - allotment option to purchase Units expired and Founder Shares were forfeited, resulting in the Sponsor and the Company s independent directors holding an aggregate of Founder Shares. The registration statement for the Company s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on July 13, 2023. On July 18, 2023, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of units (the Units and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares ), which includes a partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of Units, at per unit, generating gross proceeds of , which is discussed in Note 3. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of warrants Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant, in a private placement to the direct or indirect owners of the Sponsor (the Private Warrant holders ), generating gross proceeds of , which is discussed in Note 4. In addition, the direct or indirect owners of the Sponsor loaned the Company a total of , and in exchange, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes to each lender for an aggregate principal amount of (see Note 5), as of the closing date of the Initial Public Offering at interest, which are referred to as the Overfunding Loans. The Overfunding Loans will be repaid upon the closing of the initial Business Combination or converted into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of per warrant (or any combination thereof), at the Sponsor s discretion, which warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. The Overfunding Loans were extended in order to ensure that the amount in the Trust Account (as defined below) was per Public Share at the closing of the Initial Public Offering. If the Company does not complete an initial Business Combination, the Company will not repay the Overfunding Loans from amounts held in the Trust Account, and the Trust Account proceeds will be distributed to the Public Shareholders (as defined below), subject to the limitations; however, the Company may repay the Overfunding Loans if there are funds available outside the Trust Account to do so. Transaction costs amounted to , consisting of of a cash underwriting discount, of deferred underwriting fees and of other final offering costs. The Company s initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust) at the time the Company signs a definitive agreement in connection with the initial Business Combination.

 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on July 18, 2023, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and the Overfunding Loans was placed in the trust account Trust Account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee and held in cash or invested in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. The Company will provide holders of the Company s outstanding Public Shares sold in the Initial Public Offering (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares (including any securities for which such shares are exchanged in any prior migration or other restructuring) upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) without a shareholder vote by means of a tender offer. Except as required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, the decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then held in the Trust Account (initially per Public Share). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 6). These Public Shares were recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Initial Shareholders (as defined below) have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. In addition, the Founder Shares are not entitled to redemption rights in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. The Sponsor and the Company s officers and directors (the Initial Shareholders have agreed not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (A) in a manner that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the time frame described below or (B) with respect to any other material provision relating to the rights of holders of Public Shares or pre-initial Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment. The Company has (or until July 18, 2025), or such earlier liquidation date as the Company s board of directors may approve, to consummate an initial Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within , or such earlier liquidation date as the Company s board of directors may approve, from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably

 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will constitute full and complete payment for the Public Shares and completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and its board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. The Sponsor, officers and directors will not be entitled to liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Shareholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only . In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (except for the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or by a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay Company taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party or Target that executed an agreement waiving any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account (whether or not such agreement is enforceable) or to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Going Concern Consideration As of September 30, 2024, the Company had in the operating bank account and a working capital of . Until the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that if the Company is unable to complete an Initial Business Combination by July 18, 2025, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to consummate an Initial Business Combination prior to the mandatory liquidation date. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after July 18, 2025.

The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to million of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had borrowings under the Working Capital Loans. Overfunding Convertible Notes Related Party On July 18, 2023, concurrently with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, direct or indirect owners of the Sponsor loaned the Company a total of ,and in exchange, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes to each lender for an aggregate principal amount of as of the closing of the Initial Public Offering at interest (the Overfunding Loans ). The Overfunding Loans will be repaid upon the closing of the initial Business Combination or converted into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of per warrant (or any combination thereof), at the Sponsor s discretion, which warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. The Overfunding Loans were extended in order to ensure that the amount in the Trust Account is per public share at the closing of the Initial Public Offering. If the Company does not complete an initial Business Combination, the Company will not repay the Overfunding Loans from amounts held in the Trust Account, and the Trust Account proceeds will be distributed to the Public Shareholders, subject to the limitations described herein; however, the Company may repay the Overfunding Loans if there are funds available outside the Trust Account to do so. The conversion feature was analyzed under ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion or Other Options, and the notes did not include any premium or discounts. The conversion option did not include elements that would require bifurcation under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there is outstanding under the Overfunding Loans. As the settlement or liquidation of amounts of overfunding loans are not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities, the amount is classified as a non-current liability in the accompanying condensed balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 preference shares, par value per share, with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company s board of directors.

Class A Ordinary Shares The Company is authorized to issue Class A ordinary shares with a par value of per share. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were Class A ordinary shares issued or outstanding, excluding Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption.

 vote per share and each Class B ordinary share entitling the holder to votes per share. The Class F ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class B ordinary shares at the time of an initial Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a -for- basis, and, prior to and following the initial Business Combination, each Class B ordinary share will be convertible, at the option of the holder, into Class A ordinary share, subject to adjustment for share subdivisions, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like and in each case, subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts sold in the Initial Public Offering and related to the closing of the initial Business Combination, the ratio at which the Founder Shares shall convert into Class A ordinary shares or Class B ordinary shares, as applicable, will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding Founder Shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares or Class B ordinary shares, as applicable, issuable upon conversion thereof will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination, any private placement warrants issued to the Sponsor or its affiliates upon conversion of Working Capital Loans made to the Company and the Overfunding Loans). Warrants At September 30, 2024, there are warrants outstanding. Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Public Warrants will trade. The warrants have an exercise price of per share, subject to adjustments, and will expire after the completion of an initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The warrants will become exercisable days after the completion of an initial Business Combination; provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants, and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or the Company permits holders to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act). While the Company has registered the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act as part of the registration statement for the Company s Initial Public Offering, the Company does not plan on keeping a prospectus current until required to pursuant to the warrant agreement. However, the Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than business days after the closing of the initial Business Combination, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a post- effective amendment to the registration statement or a new registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants. The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective within after the closing of its initial Business Combination and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration or redemption of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than per Class A ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average price of the Class A ordinary shares during the trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the Market Value is below per share, (i) the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price and (ii) the per share redemption trigger price described under Redemption of warrants for cash when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company s Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the

 after the completion of an initial Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions, and they will not be redeemable by the Company. The Private Placement Warrants may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis. Except as described herein, the Private Placement Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the Public Warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. Redemption of warrants for cash when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants: in whole and not in part; at a price of per warrant; upon a minimum of prior written notice of redemption (the 30-day redemption period and if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within a -trading day period commencing at least after completion of the initial Business Combination and ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
 The Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is effective, and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the -day redemption period or the company has elected to require exercise of the warrants on a cashless basis. If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. The Company has established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and the Company issues a notice of redemption of the warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Class A ordinary shares may fall below the redemption trigger price (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) as well as the (for whole shares) warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant. If the Company is unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.

Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on April 12, 2023, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the initial business combination ). We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering of 30,500,000 units, the sale of the 9,540,000 warrants sold in a private placement to the direct or indirect owners of our sponsor and the overfunding loans, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete an initial business combination will be successful. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from April 12, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for an initial business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues prior to the completion of our initial business combination at the earliest. Following our Initial Public Offering, we generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on permitted investments from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 3,971,625, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account of 4,450,892, offset by operating costs of 479,267. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 11,340,536, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account of 12,345,276, offset by operating costs of 1,004,740. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 3,507,082, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 3,272,323, change in fair value of over-allotment option liability of 402,224, other income of 290 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of 86,189, offset by operating costs of 253,944. For the period from April 12, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 3,499,655, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 3,272,323, change in fair value of over-allotment option liability of 402,224, other income of 290 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of 86,189, offset by operating costs of 261,371. Liquidity and Capital Resources Until the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our only source of liquidity was an initial purchase of Class F ordinary shares by our sponsor and loans from our sponsor. On July 18, 2023, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 30,500,000 units, which includes the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 500,000 units, at 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 305,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 9,540,000 private placement warrants to the direct or indirect owners of our Sponsor, at a price of 1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of 9,540,000. In addition, the direct or indirect owners of our sponsor loaned the Company a total of 3,050,000, and in exchange, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes to each lender for an aggregate principal amount of 3,050,000, as of the closing date of the Initial Public Offering at no interest, which is referred to as the overfunding loans. The overfunding loans will be repaid upon the closing of the initial business combination or converted into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant (or any combination thereof), at our sponsor s discretion, which warrants will be identical to the private placement warrants. The overfunding loans were extended in order to ensure that the amount in the trust account was 10.10 per share at the closing of the Initial Public Offering. If the Company does not complete an initial business combination, the Company will not repay the overfunding loans from amounts held in the trust account, and the trust account proceeds will be distributed to the Company s public shareholders, subject to the limitations; however, the Company may repay the overfunding loans if there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Following the Initial Public Offering, sale of the private placement warrants and the overfunding loans, a total of 308,050,000 was placed in the trust account. We incurred transaction costs of 17,966,142 consisting of 6,100,000 of cash underwriting discount, 10,675,000 of deferred underwriting fees, and 1,191,142 of other final offering costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 264,250. Net income of 11,340,536 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of 12,345,276. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 740,490 of cash for operating activities. For the period from April 12, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 544,434. Net income of 3,499,655 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 3,272,323, payment of formation costs through issuance of Class F ordinary shares of 7,427, unrealized gain on marketable securities held in trust account of 86,189 and changes in fair value of over-allotment option liability of 402,224. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used 290,780 of cash for operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had marketable securities held in the trust account of 328,013,391 (including 19,963,391 of interest income) substantially consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 185 days or less. We may withdraw interest from the trust account to pay taxes, if any. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less income taxes payable), to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds 

 21 

Table of Contents 
 held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 1,645,094. We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete an initial business combination, to pay for directors and officers liability insurance premiums. In order to finance working capital deficit or to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). If the Company completes its initial business combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds from the trust account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into private placement warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of 1.00 per private placement warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. We believe that amounts not held in the trust account will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated that are payable prior to the closing of our initial business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such initial business combination. We have determined that mandatory liquidation, should a business combination not occur by July 18, 2025, and potential subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time which is considered to be one year from the date of the issuance of the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, or operating lease obligations, other than an agreement to pay an aggregate of 15,000 per month to an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support. The underwriters were entitled to an underwriting discount of 0.20 per unit, or 6,100,000 in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, 0.35 per unit, or 10,675,000 in the aggregate, will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that the Company completes an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement for the Initial Public Offering. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements, and 

 22 

Table of Contents 
 income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting estimates: Marketable Securities in Trust Account Substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in U.S. Treasury Bills. We account for marketable securities at fair value on the condensed balance sheet. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of marketable securities held in the Trust Account are included in interest earned on marketable securities held in Trust Account in the condensed statement of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of marketable securities held in Trust Account amounts to 328,013,391 and 315,668,115, respectively. Derivative Financial Instruments We evaluate the financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statement of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. The underwriters over-allotment option was deemed to be a freestanding financial instrument indexed on the contingently redeemable shares and was accounted for as a liability pursuant to ASC 480. On August 27, 2023, the remainder of the over-allotment option to purchase 4,000,000 Units expired and the over-allotment option liability, which was initially measured at fair value of 402,224, was derecognized in the statement of operations. Warrant Instruments We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own ordinary shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Accordingly, the Company evaluated and classified the warrant instruments under equity treatment at its assigned fair value. Fair value of public warrants at issuance amounted to 3,507,500. Recent Accounting Standards Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our unaudited condensed financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds We have not sold any equity securities during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. In connection with the Public Offering, sale of the Private Placement Warrants and the Overfunding Loan, we generated gross proceeds of 317,590,000.

We paid a total of 6,100,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions and incurred approximately 1,191,142 for other costs and expenses related to the Initial Public Offering. In addition, the underwriters agreed to defer 10,675,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions.
