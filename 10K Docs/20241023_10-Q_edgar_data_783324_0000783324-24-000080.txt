 VISTA GOLD CORP. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollar amounts in U.S. dollars and in thousands, except share-related amounts) owned Mt Todd gold project Mt Todd or the Project in Northern Territory, Australia. Since acquiring Mt Todd in 2006, we have invested substantial financial resources to systematically explore, evaluate, engineer, permit, and de-risk the Project. The interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements interim statements of the Company are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of these interim statements have been included. The results reported in these interim statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be reported for the entire year. These interim statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Canadian securities regulatory authorities on Form 10-K (the 2023 Financial Statements ). The balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 as presented herein was derived from the Company s audited financial statements and, in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q, certain information and footnote disclosures required by United States generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. These interim statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates Vista having the ability to meet its obligations when due in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Because the Company does not have recurring cash inflows from operations or investments, we rely on other sources of financing to fund operations. Such funding sources may include sales of non-core assets, equity issuances, royalty or stream agreements, convertible instruments, and debt facilities. Although management estimates the Company has access to sufficient cash flows for the next twelve months, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain adequate funding, or that such funding will be on terms acceptable to the Company, to meet future operational needs which may result in the delay, reduction, or discontinuation of ongoing programs. References to are to United States dollars and A are to Australian dollars. Vista acquired Mt Todd in March 2006. The purchase price and related transaction costs of were capitalized as mineral properties. Since 2006, the Company has systematically advanced the Project through exploration, metallurgical testing, engineering, environmental/operational permitting activities, and ongoing site management activities. Prior to 2024, costs associated with these and other related activities were charged to expense as incurred. Drilling and related costs are capitalized for an ore body where proven and probable reserves exist, and the activities are directed at obtaining additional information about the ore body or converting measured, indicated, and inferred resources to proven and probable reserves. All other drilling and related costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized mineral property development drilling costs totaled and in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company

See Note 8 for a discussion of commitments and contingencies associated with Mt Todd. Corporate, United States In March 2024, the Company recorded a gain of upon sale of certain components of our used mill equipment. Gross proceeds totaling were offset by selling expense of . Accrued employee compensation and benefits cash to advance Mt Todd and for general corporate purposes, excluding direct expenditures for any project other than Mt Todd, in exchange for payments of a portion of the gross revenue from Mt Todd, (the Royalty ). The Royalty is at a rate of of gross revenue from the Project if the completion objectives for the Project are achieved by April 1, 2028. Beginning April 1, 2028, if the completion objectives for the Project are not achieved, the Royalty shall increase annually at a rate of up to to a maximum Royalty rate of . Any annual increases beginning April 1, 2028 shall be reduced on a pro rata basis to the extent that Mt Todd has initiated operations but has yet to achieve a completion test at an average daily processing rate of tonnes per day. The Royalty rate, the annual increase percentage, and maximum Royalty rate can each be reduced by one-third upon the occurrence of one of the following events: (i) a change of control of Vista Gold Australia occurs prior to April 1, 2028 and Vista Gold Australia provides timely notice and payment to Wheaton of certain amounts; or (ii) payment to Wheaton of the applicable Royalty associated with Vista Gold Australia delivering million gold ounces to a third party. The Royalty is payable on production from both the Mt Todd mining and exploration licenses. Wheaton has also been granted a right of first refusal on future royalties, streams or pre-pays pertaining to Mt Todd. The Royalty Agreement provides for Vista Gold Australia to receive a total of in installments, all of which were received by Vista prior to June 30, 2024. Upon receipt of the final instalment in June 2024, the Company recognized a gain on grant of royalty interest in mineral titles of . The gain comprises previously deferred instalment payments totaling and the received for the final instalment, net of the associated mineral property carrying value as of the date the final instalment was received. A security interest was granted by Vista Gold Australia to Wheaton. The security includes, among other things, a mortgage over the Mt Todd tenements and a collateralized interest in the assets, rights and interests of Vista Gold Australia.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements and information as a result of many factors. See section heading Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements below. All dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars in thousands, except per share amounts, commodity prices, and currency exchange rates unless specified otherwise. Overview Vista Gold Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Vista, the Company, we, our, or us operate as a development-stage company in the gold mining industry. Vista does not currently generate cash flows from mining operations. Our flagship asset is the Mt Todd Gold Project Mt Todd or the Project ), a shovel-ready development-stage gold deposit located in the Tier-1 jurisdiction of Northern Territory, Australia (the NT ). Mt Todd offers significant scale, development optionality, growth opportunities, advanced local infrastructure, community support, and demonstrated economic feasibility. We are positioning Mt Todd as a leading development opportunity within the gold sector. Our strategy is to advance Mt Todd in ways that efficiently position the project for development while exercising the discipline necessary to best realize value at the right time. We expect continued strength in the gold price and believe that shovel-ready projects like Mt Todd are especially attractive development opportunities in the current environment of a strong gold market, diminishing major deposit discoveries, and depleting gold reserves. The Project offers strategic optionality through development as a large or mid-scale project and has all major operating and environmental permits necessary to initiate development. A feasibility study for Mt Todd was completed in 2022 with project costs updated in 2024 demonstrating strong economics for development of a 50,000 tonnes per day ktpd ), nominally 17.5 million tonnes per annum mtpa ), operation. In view of the substantial investment required to develop Mt Todd as a large-scale project, we completed an internal scoping study in 2023 for an alternative 15 ktpd operation, nominally 5.2 mtpa. A project of this scale could reduce financing, development, and operating risks. We are finalizing trade-off studies and preliminary evaluations for Mt Todd and anticipate moving forward with a feasibility study targeting throughput in the range of 12-17 ktpd (4-6 mtpa), with 150,000 to 200,000 ounces (150-200 koz of annual gold production, an initial capital cost of less than 400 million, and a mineral reserve grade of approximately 1 gram gold per tonne g Au/t ). By using contract mining, third-party power generation, and construction practices commonly used in Australia, we believe there is opportunity to maintain high capital efficiency at this project scale. The feasibility study will leverage prior technical studies and the work completed for the 50 ktpd feasibility study, preserve the potential for future expansion, and demonstrate the opportunity for Mt Todd to deliver substantial economic returns in a range of development scenarios. A decision to commence the feasibility study is expected prior to the end of the year. The Company undertook a drilling program earlier this year in connection with the technical studies for an alternative scale development plan. This planned 6,000-7,000 meter program is nearing completion and is expected to have a total cost of approximately 2,000. To date, this drilling program has successfully confirmed the extension of the core zone and the

 mineralized boundaries in the northern section of the Batman deposit and identified multiple high-grade intercepts in the South Cross Lode zone, a narrower mineralized structure adjacent to the Batman deposit that extends up to 400 meters to the northeast. Our geologists are presently working to understand the open pit and underground mining potential of this zone and develop a model for future exploration in this zone along with other known higher-grade targets northeast of the Batman deposit. For additional information on the Company s recent exploration drilling results, see the Company s news release dated September 14, 2024 available at www.sec.gov and under our profile at www.sedarplus.ca. This news release is referenced for informational purposes only and is not incorporated by reference into this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and should not be considered part of this or any other report filed with the SEC. The Company continues to prioritize a low overall spending profile and efficient use of resources to advance Mt Todd. Our funding strategy is to maintain adequate liquidity while minimizing dilution as we seek to preserve, enhance, and realize value from Mt Todd. The Company periodically raises funds in the capital markets and considers alternative strategies and possible corporate opportunities as means to enhance its liquidity and deliver shareholder value. Mt Todd 2024 Feasibility Study The Batman deposit at Mt Todd hosts proven and probable mineral reserves of 6.98 million ounces as reported in the March 2024 feasibility study (the Mt Todd FS ). There is opportunity to add gold mineral resources beyond presently defined mineral reserves through further exploration. Exploration at Mt Todd has identified additional growth targets immediately outside the Batman deposit along a 5.4 kilometer trend within the Company s mining licenses and other precious and base metals prospects within the broader footprint of the Company s exploration licenses. The Mt Todd FS was completed in conjunction with our annual reporting of mineral resources and mineral reserves as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as required pursuant to Item 1300 of Regulation S-K S-K 1300 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The updated feasibility study reflects changes in project economics since the feasibility study filed in February 2022. Material capital and operating cost components were updated with quotes obtained in the first quarter of 2024. The updated study also reflects the outlook for the long-term gold price and foreign exchanges rates as of the first quarter of 2024, and the Royalty (as defined below). Mt Todd mineral resources and mineral reserves, mine plans, gold recoveries, and gold production schedules remain unchanged. The Mt Todd FS contemplates a plant processing 50 ktpd and demonstrates the underlying value potential of a large-scale gold project. Highlights include: 
 estimated proven and probable mineral reserves of 6.98 million ounces of gold (280 Mt at 0.77 g Au/t) using a gold price of 1,500 for the mineral reserve estimate and a cut-off grade of 0.35 g Au/t (1)(2) ; average annual production of 395,000 ounces of gold over a 16-year mine life at an average cash cost of 913 per ounce (3) ; high capital efficiency, with initial capital requirements of 1.03 billion, or 163 per payable ounce of gold (3) ; after-tax NPV 5 of 1.13 billion and internal rate of return IRR of 20.4 at a gold price of 1,800 per ounce; and after-tax NPV 5 of 3.1 billion and IRR of 41.2 at a price of 2,600 per ounce of gold. 
 (1) Note to investors: Proven and probable mineral reserves are estimated in accordance with S-K 1300 (as defined below) and CIM Definition Standards (as defined below). (2) See Item 2. Properties Mt Todd Gold Project, Northern Territory, Australia Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserve Estimates in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 14, 2024 for additional information. (3) Cash costs, cash cost per ounce, and initial capital requirements per payable ounce of gold are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures; see Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures for additional disclosure. After completing the Mt Todd FS, the NT enacted the Mineral Royalties Act 2024 Royalties Act effective July 1, 2024. The Royalties Act replaces the prior net profits royalty regime with an ad valorem royalty regime for new mines. A 3.5 ad valorem royalty rate will be applied under the Royalties Act to gold production from Mt Todd. This represents a nearly

Table of Contents 
 50 reduction in payable NT royalties compared to the Mt Todd FS and is expected to result in improved project economics. Under the previous net profits royalty regime, our base case economic analysis at an 1,800 gold price estimated the payment of 765 million in NT royalties over the life of the mine. Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Estimates The tables below present the estimated mineral resources and mineral reserves for the Project. The following mineral resources and mineral reserves were prepared in accordance with S-K 1300 as set forth in the Mt Todd FS, which is available as Exhibit 96.1 to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024.

Notes: Thomas L. Dyer, P.E., is the QP responsible for reporting the Batman Deposit Proven and Probable mineral reserves. Batman pit optimization and design are based on a gold price of US 1,500 per ounce of gold with an elevated cutoff grade of 0.35 g Au/t. Batman deposit Proven and Probable mineral reserves are reported with a Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty based on a gold price of 1,800 per ounce of gold. Deepak Malhotra is the QP responsible for reporting the heap-leach pad mineral reserves. Because all the heap-leach pad reserves are to be fed through the mill, these reserves are reported without a cutoff grade applied. The mineral reserves point of reference is the point where material is fed into the mill. The effective date of the mineral reserve estimates under the requirements of S-K 1300 is December 31, 2023. There have been no changes in the mineral reserve estimates since December 31, 2022 because the Company and the relevant qualified persons determined that the same material assumptions and criteria continued to apply as of December 31, 2023, including that the Company used a cutoff grade higher than the economic cutoff grade such that any intervening changes in the underlying economic assumptions were not material and did not require use of a cutoff grade greater than 0.35 g Au/t for mineral reserve estimation purposes. The effective date of the mineral reserve estimates under the requirements of NI 43-101 is December 31, 2023. 
 Cautionary note to investors: Proven and probable mineral reserves are estimated in accordance with each of S-K 1300 and CIM Definition Standards. A number of risk factors may adversely affect estimated mineral reserves and mineral resources, any of which may result in a reduction or elimination of reported mineral reserves and mineral resources. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024. Results from Operations Summary Cash totaled 18,954 and working capital was 18,083 at September 30, 2024. See Liquidity and Capital Resources . The Company had no debt as of September 30, 2024. Consolidated net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1,638 and 1,454, or 0.01 and 0.01 per basic share, respectively. Consolidated net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 12,922 and 4,928), or 0.11 and 0.04) per basic share, respectively. The principal components of the period-over-period changes are discussed below.

 Operating income and expenses Gain on Grant of Royalty Interest in Mineral Titles The Company recognized a gain on grant of royalty interest in mineral titles of 16,909 in June 2024. The gain comprises the previously deferred gain on instalment payments totaling 10,000 and the gain on 10,000 received for the final instalment, net of the associated mineral property carrying value of 3,091 as of the date the final instalment was received. Exploration, property evaluation and holding costs Exploration, property evaluation and holding costs were 1,099 and 848 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and 2,509 and 2,334 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in 2024 for the comparable three-month and nine-month periods was primarily attributable to expenses related to the 2024 drilling program that did not qualify as development drilling and greater focus by corporate personnel on site-related projects. Corporate administration Corporate administration costs were 720 and 666 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and 2,726 and 2,712 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in 2024 for the comparable three-month periods was partially due to personnel costs being higher by 67. The total expenses in the comparable nine-month periods were substantially unchanged. Gain on sale of plant and equipment In March 2024, the Company recorded a gain of 802 upon sale of certain components of our used mill equipment. Gross proceeds totaled 900 and were offset by selling expense of 98. Non-operating income and expenses Interest income Interest income was 230 and 68 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and 496 and 207 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases in the 2024 periods were due to higher average cash balances, which resulted primarily from the proceeds received under the Royalty Agreement (as defined below). Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating activities Net cash used in operating activities was 3,808 and 4,090 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in operating cash outflows largely resulted from net changes in working capital components and capitalization of direct labor costs associated with the development drilling program that were recognized as investing activities. Investing activities Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was 16,139 and 43) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company received the second instalment payment of 7,000 and final instalment payment of 10,000 under the Royalty Agreement and 802 for the sale of certain used mill equipment, net of selling costs, in the 2024 period. These inflows were partially offset by expenditures for capitalized development drilling costs of 1,503.

 Financing activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash of 554 and 871, respectively, was provided by financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 639 of net proceeds under the ATM Program (as defined below) offset by payments of 85 for employee withholding tax obligations in lieu of issuing common shares of the Company Common Shares earned from the vesting of restricted share unit awards. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1,013 of net proceeds under the ATM Program offset by payments of 142 for employee withholding tax obligations in lieu of issuing Common Shares earned from the vesting of restricted share unit awards. Liquidity and capital resources The Company considers available cash, cash equivalents, and any short-term investments to be its primary measure of liquidity. Our cash liquidity position as of September 30, 2024, comprising cash and cash equivalents of 18,954, reflected a net increase of 12,885 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Current assets, net of current liabilities Working Capital ), is a secondary measure of liquidity for the Company. The Company had Working Capital of 18,083 and 5,576 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s primary sources of cash inflows were: 17,000 from its grant of the Royalty on Mt Todd; 802 upon sale of a portion of its used mill equipment; 639 from equity financings, and 496 from interest income. As of September 30, 2024, Vista has received the entire 20,000 as set forth in the Royalty Agreement. Cash received from Wheaton is only for the purposes of advancing Mt Todd and general corporate purposes. These sources of cash were offset by net operating cash outflows of 3,808 and other expenditures of 1,748. Recurring costs for corporate administration and Mt Todd maintenance were most of the Company s net operating cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Of the other expenditures, 1,503 related to Vista s development drilling program at Mt Todd. Additional details regarding 2024 financial results are presented in the Results from Operations section above and the preceding discussions in this section regarding operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. For the ensuing 12 months following September 30, 2024, the Company estimates net recurring costs will be approximately 6,400, plus 4,200 relates to work plans at Mt Todd for the finalization of a 6,000-7,000-meter drilling program; purchase of equipment for a water evaporation system; various technical studies, and several planned maintenance projects. Management expects to fund Vista s activities during the next twelve months from existing Working Capital and interest income. In addition to Vista s existing capital resources, we are a party to an at-the-market offering agreement (the ATM Agreement with H. C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright to provide balance sheet flexibility at a potentially lower cost than other means of equity issuances. Under the ATM Agreement, the Company can, but is not obligated to, issue and sell Common Shares through Wainwright for aggregate gross proceeds of up to 10,000 (the ATM Program ). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 1,018,564 Common Shares under the ATM Program for net proceeds of 639. As of September 30, 2024, 8,042 remained available under the ATM Program. Offers and sales of Common Shares under the ATM Program were and will be made only in the United States in an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, subject to an effective registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and no offers or sales of Common Shares under the ATM Agreement will be made in Canada. The Common Shares were and will be distributed at market prices prevailing at the time of sale. Other potential sources of cash inflows may include other equity issuances not covered by the ATM Program, monetization of Vista s remaining non-core assets, which include a royalty interest on a property in the U.S., another royalty interest on a property in Canada, and used mill equipment that is being marketed by a third-party mining equipment dealer. We believe our Working Capital as of September 30, 2024, together with interest income, other potential future sources of

Table of Contents 
 financing and sales of non-core assets, will be sufficient to fund our currently planned corporate expenses, Mt Todd holding costs, and anticipated discretionary programs for at least one year from the date of issuance of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Vista s long-term viability depends upon our ability to realize value from our principal asset, Mt Todd. We seek to maintain adequate liquidity and minimize dilution as we advance our primary objective to maximize returns to our shareholders by preserving, enhancing, and realizing value from Mt Todd. Our funding strategy is to maintain a low expenditure profile, realize value from our remaining non-core assets and, when considered appropriate, issue additional equity or find other means of financing. Vista also considers possible corporate opportunities as a means to enhance our liquidity. The underlying value and recoverability of the amounts shown as mineral properties and plant and equipment as presented in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets depend on market and industry conditions, our ability to attract sufficient capital resources to execute our strategy, and the ultimate success of our programs to enhance and realize value at Mt Todd. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations We have no material contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024. Critical Accounting Policies See "Critical Accounting Estimates and Recent Accounting Pronouncements" under Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC. Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures In this report, we have provided information prepared or calculated according to U.S. GAAP, as well as provided certain non-U.S. GAAP prospective financial performance measures. Because the non-U.S. GAAP performance measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are limitations associated with the use of such non-U.S. GAAP measures. Since these measures do not incorporate revenues, changes in working capital and non-operating cash costs, they are not necessarily indicative of potential operating profit or loss, or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-U.S. GAAP measures associated with cash costs, cash costs per ounce, and initial capital requirements per payable ounce of gold metrics are not, and are not intended to be, presentations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These metrics represent costs and unit-cost measures related to the Project. We believe that these metrics help investors understand the economics of the Project. We present the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures for our Project in the tables below. Actual U.S. GAAP results may vary from the amounts disclosed in this report. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Cash Costs, Initial Capital Requirements per Payable Ounce of Gold, and Respective Unit Cost Measures Cash costs, cash costs per ounce, and initial capital requirements per payable ounce of gold, are non-U.S. GAAP metrics developed by the World Gold Council to provide transparency into the costs associated with producing gold and provide a standard for comparison across the industry. The Company reports cash costs on a per ounce basis because we believe this metric appropriately reflects the direct mining costs associated with gold production over the life of mine. The Company reports initial capital cost requirements per payable ounce of gold because this metric provides a standard measurement of initial capital efficiency. Similar metrics are widely used in the gold mining industry as comparative benchmarks of performance.

Table of Contents 
 Cash costs consist of Project operating costs, refining costs, and the Jawoyn Association royalty and Wheaton Royalty. The sum of these costs is divided by the corresponding payable gold ounces to determine cash cost per ounce. Other costs excluded from cash costs include depreciation and amortization, income taxes, government royalties, financing charges, costs related to business combinations, asset acquisitions, and asset dispositions. Initial capital requirements per payable ounce of gold consist of total initial capital requirements divided by the corresponding payable gold ounces. The following tables demonstrate the calculation of cash costs, cash costs per ounce, and initial capital requirements per payable ounce metrics for amounts presented in this report. 

Units Life of Mine (16 years) Payable gold koz 6,313 Operating costs US millions 5,420 Refining cost US millions 23 Royalties US millions 324 Cash costs US millions 5,767 Cash cost per ounce US /oz 913 Initial capital requirements US millions 1,030 Initial capital requirements per payable ounce of gold US /oz 163 Project Updates Mt Todd Gold Project, Northern Territory, Australia Recent Developments The Company announced the results of updated SK-1300 and NI 43-101 feasibility studies in March and April 2024, respectively. The updated feasibility studies reflect changes in project economics since the feasibility study report filed in February 2022. Material capital and operating cost components have been updated with quotes obtained during the first quarter of 2024. The studies reflect the current outlook for the long-term gold price and foreign exchange rates, and the Wheaton Royalty. Mt Todd mineral resources and mineral reserves, mine plans, gold recoveries, and gold production schedules remain unchanged. The technical data and economic conclusions of the NI 43-101 report are materially identical to the results of the S-K 1300 report, with differences in the formatting of the reports and details of certain assumptions resulting only from the respective disclosure requirements of NI 43-101 and S-K 1300. In December 2023, the Company announced a royalty agreement with Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (the Royalty Agreement and Wheaton whereby Vista granted a 1 gross revenue royalty, subject to adjustment, on future gold production from Mt Todd to Wheaton in exchange for cash payments totaling 20 million (the Royalty ). As of June 30, 2024, the entire 20 million had been received by Vista. The Company undertook a drilling program earlier this year as a precursor to beginning a feasibility study for an alternate development plan. This program is nearing completion of the planned 6,000-7,000 meter program. To date, this drilling program has successfully confirmed the extension of the core zone and the mineralized boundaries in the northern section of the Batman deposit and identified multiple high-grade intercepts in the South Cross Lode zone, a narrower mineralized structure that intersects the Batman deposit and extends up to 400 meters northeast.

 Vista expects to incur expenditures of approximately 2,500 for its Mt Todd site management and environmental stewardship activities and 4,200 for discretionary programs for the ensuing 12 months following September 30, 2024, most of which relates to the 2024 drilling program. The Northern Territory s Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority AAPA is investigating the potential surface impacts of drilling undertaken by Vista from 2020 through 2022. The Company is cooperating with the AAPA. All scientific and technical information herein has been reviewed and approved by Maria Vallejo Garcia, Vista s Director of Projects and Technical Services, and designated Qualified Person (or QP as defined by S-K 1300 and NI 43-101. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations Vista believes it is possible the Company may be classified as a passive foreign investment company PFIC as defined under Section 1297 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in recent years and expects to continue to be a PFIC in the future. Current and prospective United States shareholders should consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of PFIC classification and the U.S. federal tax treatment of PFICs. Additional information on this matter is included in Vista s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under Part II. Item 5.

Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and forward-looking information under Canadian securities laws that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such legislation. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Canadian securities commissions and in press releases and public statements by our officers or representatives that address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements and forward-looking information, including, but not limited to, such things as those listed below. Operations Our belief that Mt Todd is a shovel-ready development-stage gold that offers significant scale, development optionality, growth opportunities, advanced local infrastructure, community support, and demonstrated economic feasibility; our belief the Mt Todd can be positioned as a leading development opportunity within the gold sector; our expectation that continued strength in the gold price and belief that shovel-ready projects like Mt Todd are especially attractive development opportunities in the current environment of a strong gold market, diminishing major deposit discoveries, and depleting gold reserves; our belief that Mt Todd offers strategic optionality through development as a large or mid-scale project and has all major operating and environmental permits necessary to initiate development; our belief that the feasibility study updated in 2024 demonstrates strong economics for development of a 50,000 tpd operation; our belief that there is an opportunity to add gold mineral resources beyond presently defined mineral reserves through further exploration; our belief that the Project has high capital efficiency; our belief that using contract mining and power generation and construction practices commonly used in Australia could create an opportunity to maintain high capital efficiency at a smaller initial project scale; 

 21 

Table of Contents 
 our belief that a project at the scale of the internal scoping study could reduce financing, development, and operating risks; our anticipation of moving forward with a feasibility study targeting throughput in the range of 12-17 ktpd (4-6 mtpa), with 150,000 to 200,000 ounces (150-200 koz of annual gold production, an initial capital cost of less than 400 million, and a mineral reserve grade of approximately 1 gram gold per tonne; our belief that the updated feasibility study will leverage prior technical studies and the work completed for the 50 ktpd feasibility study, preserve the potential for future expansion, and demonstrate the opportunity for Mt Todd to deliver substantial economic returns in a range of development scenarios; our expectation that a decision to commence the feasibility study would happen prior to the end of the year; our belief that the drilling program has successfully confirmed the extension of the core zone and the mineralized boundaries in the northern section of the Batman deposit and identified multiple high-grade intercepts in the South Cross Lode zone, a narrower mineralized structure that intersects the Batman deposit and extends up to 400 meters northeast; our belief that exploration at Mt Todd has identified additional growth targets immediately outside the Batman deposit; our estimates of future operating and financial performance; our belief that the 3.5 ad valorem royalty regime applied to gold production from Mt Todd represents a nearly 50 reduction in payable royalties and results in improved project economics and shareholder returns when compared to our 2024 updated Mt Todd FS, which included NT royalties equivalent to nearly a 7 ad valorum rate. Our belief that under the previous net profits royalty regime, our base case economic analysis at an 1,800 gold price estimated the payment of 765 million in NT royalties over the life of the mine; our belief that the 6,000-7,000 meter Mt Todd drilling program is expected to have an all-in cost of approximately 2,000 and is nearing completion; our belief our working capital as of September 30, 2024, together with interest income, other potential future sources of financing and sales of non-core assets, will be sufficient to fund our currently planned corporate expenses, Mt Todd holding costs, and anticipated discretionary programs for at least one year from the date of issuance of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q; our estimate that the outcome of the Mexico tax matter cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, and our estimate that the effect of the court ruling creates a potential income tax liability of up to approximately 2,000 plus assessable interest and penalties of up to an additional 1,500; our belief that Vista s long-term viability depends upon our ability to realize value from our principal asset, Mt Todd; our objective to maintain adequate liquidity and minimize dilution as we advance our primary objective to maximize returns to our shareholders by preserving, enhancing, and realizing value from Mt Todd; our estimate that recurring costs will be approximately 6,400 in the ensuing twelve months following September 30, 2024; our expectation that Vista will incur approximately 2,500 for its Mt Todd site management and environmental stewardship activities and 4,200 for discretionary programs for the ensuing 12 months following September 30, 2024; 
 Business and Industry our belief that it is possible the Company may be classified as PFIC for U.S. Federal tax purposes; the potential that we may grant stock-based compensation to our directors, officers, employees and consultants; and
