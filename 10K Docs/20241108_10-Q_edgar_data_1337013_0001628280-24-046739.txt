 reportable segments, Patient Services and Device Solutions. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company also operated through First Biomedical, Inc., a Kansas Corporation, which was a wholly-owned subsidiary that merged into InfuSystem, Inc. on January 1, 2024. 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for interim financial information. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") for complete financial statements. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, composed of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary by management to fairly state the Company s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on April 10, 2024. 
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the reporting date and the amounts of revenue and expenses in the periods presented. The Company believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.

 million, that matures on February 5, 2026. The Revolving Facility may be increased by million, subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the Agent and obtaining necessary commitments. The lenders under the 2021 Credit Agreement may issue up to million in letters of credit subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. On February 5, 2021, the Borrowers made an initial borrowing of million under the Revolving Facility. Proceeds from the loan, along with approximately million in cash, were used to repay all amounts due under the Company s then existing credit facility dated March 23, 2015 (the "2015 Credit Agreement"). 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement has customary representations and warranties. The ability to borrow under the facility is subject to ongoing compliance with a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers, acquisitions, investments, asset sales, affiliate transactions and restricted payments, as well as financial covenants, including the following: 
 a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement) less of depreciation expense), to consolidated fixed charges (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement)) for the prior four most recently ended calendar quarters of to 1.00; and 
 a maximum leverage ratio (defined as total indebtedness to EBITDA for the prior four most recently ended calendar quarters) of to 1.00. 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement includes customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default will permit the lenders to terminate commitments to lend under the Revolving Facility and accelerate payment of all amounts outstanding thereunder. 
 Simultaneous with the execution of the 2021 Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement to secure repayment of the obligations of the Borrowers. Under the Pledge and Security Agreement, each Borrower has granted to the Agent, for the benefit of various secured parties, a first priority security interest in substantially all of the personal property assets and shares of each of the Borrowers. 
 On April 26, 2023, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the 2021 Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment") with the Agent and the lenders party thereto, which amended the 2021 Credit Agreement, to provide for, among other things: (i) an extension of the maturity date for the 2021 Credit Agreement to April 26, 2028, (ii) the replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") with Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as a benchmark interest rate, and (iii) an increase of the maximum dollar amount of incremental revolving loans from million to million. Incremental revolving loans continue to be subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the Agent and obtaining necessary commitments. 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement and First Amendment were accounted for as debt modifications. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all debt-related covenants under the 2021 Credit Agreement, as amended.

 As of September 30, 2024, amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility provided under the 2021 Credit Agreement, as amended, bear interest at a variable rate equal to, at the Company s election, Adjusted Term SOFR for Term Benchmark loans or an Alternative Base Rate for ABR loans, as defined by the First Amendment, plus a spread that will vary depending upon the Company s leverage ratio. The spread ranges from to for Term Benchmark Loans and to for base rate loans. The weighted-average Term Benchmark loan rate at September 30, 2024 was (Adjusted Term SOFR of plus ).

The new swap has a constant notional amount over a term that ends on April 26, 2028. The agreement pays the Company 30-day SOFR on the notional amount and the Company pays a fixed rate of interest equal to . The Company does not have any other derivative financial instruments.

 . The Company s leases do not contain any restrictive covenants. The Company s office leases generally contain renewal options for periods ranging from one to . Because the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term, and payments associated with the option years are excluded from lease payments.

 Overview 
 We are a leading national health care service provider, facilitating outpatient care for Durable Medical Equipment manufacturers and health care providers. We provide our products and services to hospitals, oncology practices, ambulatory surgery centers, and other alternate site health care providers. Our headquarters is in Rochester Hills, Michigan, and we operate our business from a total of seven locations in the United States and Canada. We deliver local, field-based customer support, and we operate pump service and repair Centers of Excellence in Michigan, Kansas, California, Massachusetts, Texas and Ontario, Canada. InfuSystem, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is accredited by the Community Health Accreditation Partner (CHAP). We are also ISO 9001 certified at our Kansas, Michigan, Massachusetts, Canada and Santa Fe Springs, California locations and ISO 13485 certified at our Bakersfield, California location. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company also operated through First Biomedical, Inc., a Kansas Corporation, which was a wholly-owned subsidiary that merged into InfuSystem, Inc. on January 1, 2024. 
 InfuSystem competes for and retains its business primarily on the basis of its long participation and strong reputation in the Durable Medical Equipment space, its long-standing relationships with Durable Medical Equipment manufacturers and its health care provider customers, and the high levels of service it provides. Current barriers to entry for potential competitors are created by our: (i) growing number of third-party payer networks under contract; (ii) economies of scale, which allow for predictable reimbursement and less costly purchase and management of the pumps, respectively; (iii) established, long-standing relationships as a provider of pumps to outpatient oncology practices in the U.S. and Canada; (iv) pump fleet of ambulatory and large volume infusion pumps for rent and for sale, which may allow us to be more responsive to the needs of physicians, outpatient oncology practices, hospitals, outpatient surgery centers, homecare practices, patient rehabilitation centers and patients than a new market entrant; (v) seven geographic locations in the U.S. and Canada that allow for same day or next day delivery of pumps; and (vi) pump repair and service capabilities at all of these facilities and at our customer's locations. We do not perform any research and development on pumps, but we have made, and continue to make, investments in our information technology applications. 
 Patient Services Segment 
 Our Patient Services segment s core purpose is to seek opportunities to grow our business by leveraging our unique know-how in clinic-to-home health care involving Durable Medical Equipment, our logistics and billing capabilities, our growing network of third-party payers under contract, and our clinical and biomedical capabilities. This leverage may take the form of new products and/or services, strategic alliances, joint ventures and/or acquisitions. The leading service within our Patient Services segment is to supply electronic ambulatory infusion pumps and associated disposable supply kits to private oncology clinics, infusion clinics and hospital outpatient oncology clinics to be utilized in the treatment of a variety of cancers, including colorectal cancer and other disease states ("Oncology Business"). Colorectal cancer is the fourth most prevalent form of cancer in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society, and the standard of care for the treatment of colorectal cancer relies upon continuous chemotherapy infusions delivered via ambulatory infusion pumps. One of the goals for the Patient Services segment is to expand into treatment of other types of cancers. There are a number of approved treatment protocols for pancreatic, head and neck, esophageal and other types of cancers, as well as other disease states that present opportunities for growth. There are also a number of other drugs currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), as well as agents in the pharmaceutical development pipeline, which we believe could potentially be used with continuous infusion protocols for the treatment of diseases other than colorectal cancer. Additional drugs or protocols currently in clinical trials may also obtain regulatory approval over the next several years. If these new drugs or protocols obtain regulatory approval for use with continuous infusion protocols, we expect the pharmaceutical companies to focus their sales and marketing efforts on promoting the new drugs and protocols to physicians, which could benefit us. 
 Furthermore, our Oncology Business focuses mainly on the continuous infusion of chemotherapy. Continuous infusion of chemotherapy can be described as the gradual administration of a drug via a small, lightweight, portable infusion pump over a prolonged period of time. A cancer patient can receive his or her medicine anywhere from one to 30 days per month depending on the chemotherapy regimen that is most appropriate to that individual s health status and disease state. This may be followed by periods of rest and then repeated cycles with treatment goals of progression-free disease survival. This drug administration method has replaced intravenous push or bolus administration in specific circumstances. The advantages of slow continuous low doses of certain drugs are well documented. Clinical studies support the use of continuous infusion chemotherapy for decreased toxicity without loss of anti-tumor efficacy. The 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network ("NCCN") Guidelines recommend the use of continuous infusion for treatment of numerous cancer diagnoses. We believe that the growth of continuous infusion therapy is driven by three factors: (i) evidence of improved clinical outcomes; (ii) lower toxicity and side effects; and (iii) a favorable reimbursement environment. 

Table of Contents 

 We believe that oncology practitioners have a heightened sensitivity to providing quality service and to their ability to obtain reimbursement for services they provide. Simultaneously, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and private insurers are increasingly focused on evidence-based medicine to inform their reimbursement decisions that is, aligning reimbursement with clinical outcomes and adherence to standards of care. Continuous infusion therapy is a main component of the standard of care for certain types of cancers because clinical evidence demonstrates superior outcomes. Payers recognition of this benefit is reflected in their relative reimbursement policies for clinical services related to the delivery of this care. 
 Additional areas of focus for our Patient Services segment are as follows: 
 Pain Management providing our ambulatory pumps, products, and services for pain management in the area of post-surgical continuous peripheral nerve block. 
 Wound Care launched in November 2022, the Company established a partnership, SI Wound Care, LLC ("SI Wound Care"), with Sanara MedTech Inc. "Sanara"). The partnership focuses on delivering a complete wound care solution targeted at improving patient outcomes, lowering the cost of care, and increasing patient and provider satisfaction. The partnership enables InfuSystem to offer innovative products including negative pressure wound therapy ("NPWT") devices and supplies from Cork Medical LLC's ("Cork") and Genadyne Biotechnologies Inc. and Sanara's advanced wound care product line to new customers through the jointly controlled entity. 
 Acquisitions we believe there are opportunities to acquire smaller, regional health care service providers, in whole or part that perform similar services to us but do not have the national market access, network of third-party payer contracts or operating economies of scale that we currently enjoy. We may also pursue acquisition opportunities of companies that perform similar services, but offer different therapies or utilize different devices. 
 Information technology-based services - we also plan to continue to capitalize on key new information technology-based services such as EXPRESS, InfuBus or InfuConnect, Pump Portal, DeviceHub and BlockPain Dashboard . 
 The payer environment within our Patient Services segment is in a constant state of change. We continue to extend our considerable breadth of payer networks under contract as patients move into different insurance coverage plans, including Medicaid and Insurance Marketplace products. In some cases, this may slightly reduce our aggregate billed revenues payment rate but result in an overall increase in collected revenues, due to a reduction in concessions. Consequently, we are increasingly focused on revenues net of concessions. 
 Device Solutions Segment 
 Our Device Solutions segment s core service is to: (i) sell or rent new and pre-owned pole-mounted and ambulatory infusion pumps and other Durable Medical Equipment; (ii) sell treatment-related consumables; and (iii) provide biomedical maintenance services on medical equipment that include recertification, annual preventative maintenance and repair services for oncology practices as well as other alternate site settings, including, home care and home infusion providers, skilled nursing facilities, pain centers and others. We provide biomedical services at both our facilities and at our customers' locations. We also provide these products and services to customers in the hospital market. We purchase new and pre-owned pole-mounted and ambulatory infusion pumps from a variety of sources on a non-exclusive basis. We repair, refurbish and provide biomedical certification for the devices as needed. The pumps are then available for sale, rental or to be used within our ambulatory infusion pump management service.

 Net Revenues 
 Net revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 ("third quarter of 2024") were 35.3 million, an increase of 3.4 million, or 10.7 , compared to 31.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 ("third quarter of 2023"). The increase included higher net revenues for both the Patient Services and Device Solutions segments. 
 Patient Services 
 Patient Services net revenue of 20.8 million increased 1.5 million, or 7.7 , during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily attributable to additional treatment volume and increased third-party payer collections totaling 2.4 million, offset partially by 1.0 million lower revenue from sales-type leases of NPWT pumps. The improved volume and collections benefited Oncology revenue by 1.8 million, or 10.7 , Pain Management revenue by 0.2 

Table of Contents 

 million, or 14.3 , and Wound Care treatment revenue by 0.5 million, or 219 . The decrease in Sales-Type Lease revenue of NPWT pumps was mainly due to an unusually strong prior year comparison. 
 Device Solutions 
 Device Solutions net revenue of 14.5 million increased 1.9 million, or 15.2 , during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period. This increase included increased medical equipment sales of 1.1 million, or 89.5 , and higher rental revenue totaling 0.7 million, or 16.0 . Higher medical equipment sales were due to a large sale to an existing rental customer and reflects how timing for large contracts can vary from quarter-to-quarter. The increases in rental revenue was mainly attributable to a new customer added during the 2024 second quarter. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 of 19.0 million increased by 3.4 million, or 22.0 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase was due to the increase in net revenues and by a higher gross profit percentage of net revenue ("gross margin"). Gross margin was 53.9 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 48.9 during the prior year period, an increase of 5.0 . Gross profit and gross margin were each higher in both the Patient Services and Devices Solutions segments. 
 Patient Services 
 Patient Services gross profit was 13.7 million during the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 1.9 million, or 15.8 , compared to the prior year period. The increase reflected the higher net revenue and higher gross margin, which increased from the prior year by 4.6 to 66.0 . The increase in gross margin reflected increased third-party payer collections, favorable gross margin mix and improved coverage of fixed costs from higher net revenue. The favorable gross margin mix was mainly related to the decrease in revenue related to NPWT equipment leases which had lower average gross margin than other Patient Services revenue categories. 
 Device Solutions 
 Device Solutions gross profit during the third quarter of 2024 was 5.3 million, representing an increase of 1.6 million, or 41.2 , compared to the prior year. This increase was due to the increase in net revenue and an increased gross margin. The Device Solutions gross margin was 36.7 during the current quarter, which was 6.7 higher than the prior year period. The increase was due to favorable sales mix involving higher margin products including rental revenue and sales of used medical equipment. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses 
 Selling and marketing expenses were 2.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 1.0 , compared to the prior year. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 7.8 compared to 8.5 in the prior year period. This decrease reflected a reduction in sales team members and improved coverage of fixed costs from higher net revenues. The selling and marketing expenses during these periods consisted of sales personnel salaries, commissions and associated fringe benefit and payroll-related items, marketing, travel and entertainment and other miscellaneous expenses. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative ("G A") expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were 12.8 million, an increase of 1.8 million, or 16.8 , from the third quarter of 2023. G A expenses during these periods consisted primarily of accounting, administrative, third-party payer billing and contract services, customer service, nurses on staff, new product services, service center personnel salaries, fringe benefits and other payroll-related items, professional fees, legal fees, stock-based compensation, insurance and other miscellaneous items. The increase over the prior year of 1.8 million included increased stock-based compensation expenses of 0.2 million, increased accrued incentive compensation totaling 0.3 million, an increase in accrued bad debt expense of 0.2 million and 0.3 million of expenses not incurred in 2023 related to a project to upgrade the Company's information technology and business applications. Other increased expenses totaling 0.8 million were associated with revenue volume growth including the cost of additional personnel, information technology and general business expenses and included inflationary increases. G A expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the third quarter of 2024 increased to 36.2 from 34.3 for the prior year period. 

Table of Contents 

 Other Expenses 
 During the third quarter of 2024, other expense included interest expense of 0.5 million, which was 0.1 million lower than interest expense for the third quarter of 2023. Interest expense includes interest and other fees paid in relation to borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement, as amended, partially offset by amounts received on interest rate swap derivatives. The decrease resulted from lower average outstanding debt balances during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher commitment fees on a higher unused revolving line availability. 
 Provision For Income Taxes 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes totaling 1.0 million on pre-tax income of 2.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 35 . During the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of 0.4 million on a pre-tax income of 1.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 38 . The effective tax rates for these periods differed from the U.S. statutory rate mainly due to the effects of local, state and foreign jurisdiction income taxes and certain permanent differences in expenses recognized for tax purposes, such as non-deductible meals and entertainment, management compensation and differences between expense recognized for book purposes versus tax purposes associated with equity compensation expense. The impact of permanent differences weigh heavier on the effective tax rate when pre-tax earnings are close to break even.

Net Revenues 
 Net revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 ("nine-month period of 2024") were 101.0 million, an increase of 7.0 million, or 7.4 , compared to 94.0 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 ("nine-month period of 2023"). The increase included higher net revenues for both the Patient Services and Device Solutions segments. 

Table of Contents 

 Patient Services 
 Patient Services net revenue of 59.6 million increased 2.2 million, or 3.9 , during the nine-month period of 2024 compared to the same prior year period. This increase was primarily attributable additional treatment volume and increased third-party payer collections totaling 4.7 million offset partially by 2.5 million lower revenue from sales-type leases of NPWT pumps. The improved volume and collections benefited Oncology revenue by 3.2 million or 6.4 , Pain Management revenue by 0.4 million, or 10.4 , and Wound Care treatment revenue by 1.2 million, or 205.4 . The decrease in Sales-Type Lease revenue of NPWT pumps was mainly due to an unusually strong prior year comparison. 
 Device Solutions 
 Device Solutions net revenue of 41.4 million increased 4.8 million, or 13.0 , during the nine-month period of 2024 compared to the same prior year period. This increase included higher biomedical services revenue, which increased by 1.6 million, or 13.7 , higher rental revenue totaling 1.5 million, or 10.7 , higher disposable medical supplies revenue, which increased by 0.3 million or 4.5 and higher medical equipment sales, which increased by 1.4 million, or 30.4 . The increased biomedical revenue was mainly attributable to increased revenue from the master services agreement that we entered into in April 2022. The increases in rental revenue and disposables are mainly attributable to a new customer added during the period. Higher medical equipment sales were due to a large sale to an existing rental customer and reflects how timing for large contracts can vary from quarter-to-quarter. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit of 52.2 million for the nine-month period of 2024 increased 5.8 million, or 12.5 , from 46.4 million for the nine-month period of 2023. This increase was due to the increase in net revenues and by a higher gross margin. During the second quarter of 2024, we identified and corrected an immaterial error in our accrued liabilities associated with travel expenses resulting in a unfavorable cumulative expense adjustment to cost of revenues totaling 0.6 million. This adjustment represented 0.6 of net revenue for the nine-month period of 2024. Gross profit increased for both the Patient Services and Device Solutions segments. Gross margin increased to 51.7 during the nine-month period of 2024 compared to 49.4 during the same prior year period. Gross profit and gross margin were each higher in both the Patient Services and Devices Solutions segments. 
 Patient Services 
 Patient Services gross profit was 39.4 million during the nine-month period of 2024, representing an increase of 4.2 million, or 11.9 , compared to the same prior year period. The improvement reflected increased net revenue and higher gross margin, which increased from the prior year by 4.7 to 66.1 . The increase in gross margin reflected increased third-party payer collections, lower pump disposal expenses, favorable gross margin mix and improved coverage of fixed costs from higher net revenue. The favorable gross margin mix was mainly related to the decrease in revenue related to NPWT equipment leases, which had lower average gross margin than other Patient Services revenue categories. Pump disposal expenses, which include retirements of damaged pumps and reserves for missing pumps, decreased by 0.7 million during the nine-month period of 2024 compared to the prior year period. 
 Device Solutions 
 Device Solutions gross profit during the nine-month period of 2024 was 12.8 million, representing an increase of 1.6 million, or 14.2 , compared to the same prior year period. The improvement reflected increased net revenue. The Device Solutions gross margin was 30.8 during the current period, which was 0.3 higher than the same prior year period. This amount included a 1.5 reduction related to the error correction which was more than offset by improved sales mix favoring higher margin products including rental revenue and sales of used medical equipment. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses 
 Selling and marketing expenses for the nine-month period of 2024 were 9.2 million, representing an increase of 0.2 million, or 2.6 , compared to selling and marketing expenses for the nine-month period of 2023. Selling and marketing expenses consist of sales personnel salaries, commissions and associated fringe benefit and payroll-related items, marketing, travel and entertainment and other miscellaneous expenses. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues was 9.1 representing a slight decrease from the prior year period amount of 9.5 .

 General and Administrative Expenses 
 G A expenses for the nine-month period of 2024 were 38.0 million, an increase of 4.1 million, or 12.1 , from the nine-month period of 2023. G A expenses during these periods consisted primarily of accounting, administrative, third-party payer billing and contract services, customer service, nurses on staff, new product services, service center personnel salaries, fringe benefits and other payroll-related items, professional fees, legal fees, stock-based compensation, insurance and other miscellaneous items. Additionally, the amount for 2024 included a one-time 0.6 million payment to a former member of the board of directors related to a Cooperation Agreement and a one-time payment to the Company's former audit firm for services related to their consent to include their prior year audit report in our 2023 annual report totaling 0.3 million. The remaining increase of 3.2 million included increased stock-based compensation expenses of 0.5 million, and 0.3 million of expenses not incurred in 2023 related to a project to upgrade the Company's information technology and business applications. Other increased expenses totaling 2.4 million were associated with revenue volume growth including the cost of additional personnel, information technology and general business expenses and included inflationary increases. G A expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the nine-month period of 2024 increased to 37.6 compared to 36.0 for the same prior year period. 
 Other Expenses 
 During the nine-month period of 2024, other income and expense included interest expense of 1.4 million, which was 0.3 million lower than interest expense for the nine-month period of 2023. This decrease was due to a decrease in outstanding borrowings on the 2021 Credit Agreement, as amended, (defined below) revolving line of credit. 
 Provision For Income Taxes 
 During the nine-month period of 2024, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes totaling 1.4 million on pre-tax income of 2.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 49 . During the nine-month period of 2023, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes totaling 0.3 million on pre-tax income of 1.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 29 . These amounts differed from the U.S. statutory amounts mainly due to the effects of local, state and foreign jurisdiction income taxes, limitations on the deductions of certain expenses including meals and entertainment expense and management compensation and differences between expense recognized for book purposes versus tax purposes associated with equity compensation expense.

 As of September 30, 2024, amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility provided under the 2021 Credit Agreement, as amended, bear interest at a variable rate equal to, at the Company s election, Adjusted Term SOFR for Term Benchmark loans or an Alternative Base Rate for ABR loans, as defined by the First Amendment, plus a spread that will vary depending upon the Company s leverage ratio. The spread ranges from 2.00 to 3.00 for Term Benchmark Loans and 1.00 to 2.00 for base rate loans. The weighted-average Term Benchmark loan rate at September 30, 2024 was 7.43 (Adjusted Term SOFR of 5.08 plus 2.35 ). The actual ABR loan rate at September 30, 2024 was 9.25 (lender s prime rate of 8.00 plus 1.25 ). As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all debt-related covenants under the 2021 Credit Agreement, as amended. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On May 16, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (the "Share Repurchase Program") that authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 20.0 million of the Company s outstanding common stock through June 30, 2026. The Share Repurchase Program supersedes the previous authorization, which was set to expire on June 30, 2024. Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program are subject to market conditions, the periodic capital needs of the Company s operating activities, and the continued satisfaction of all covenants under the Company s existing 2021 Credit Agreement, as amended. Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan. The Share Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase shares and may be suspended, terminated, or modified at any time at the discretion of the Board. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million, or 149,670 shares, of the Company's outstanding common stock under the Share Repurchase Program. The Company had repurchased and retired approximately 6.2 million, or 553,149 shares under the previous authorization. 
 Cash Flows: 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, In millions 2024 2023 2023 vs. 2022 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 12,528 6,565 5,963 Net cash used in investing activities (9,970) (5,690) (4,280) Net cash used in financing activities (2,409) (879) (1,530) 

Table of Contents 

 Operating Cash Flow . Operating cash flows provided 12.5 million in cash during the nine-month period of 2024 and 6.6 million of cash during the nine-month period of 2023. This 6.0 million favorable difference was attributable to a reduction of cash used to fund working capital items, which was 1.4 million during nine-month period of 2024 compared to 6.0 million during nine-month period of 2023, a decrease of 4.6 million. The increase in operating cash flows also included an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items, which was 13.9 million during the nine-month period of 2024 compared to 12.6 million during the nine-month period of 2023, an increase of 1.3 million. The increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items was primarily attributable to higher revenue and gross profit in 2024, offset partially by increased general and administrative expenses described above. The use of cash for working capital items during the nine-month period of 2024 included a 1.2 million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities net of capital items, a 1.3 million increase in accounts receivable and a 0.3 million increase in inventories. These cash flow uses were partially offset by a 1.1 million decrease in other assets and a 0.4 million decrease in other current assets. The cash used for working capital items during the nine-month period of 2023 included a 2.3 million increase in other assets, a 1.1 million increase in other current assets, a 1.3 million increase in inventories, a 1.0 million increase in accounts receivable and a 0.3 million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities net of capital items. 
 The increase in accounts receivable during both periods was mainly due to the increase in revenue during each period. This increase was greater during the nine-month period of 2023 when the revenue was growing at a higher rate and increased revenue attributable to sales-type leases was included, which resulted in higher lease receivables (of which the long-term portion is included in other assets versus accounts receivable) and to the biomedical master services agreement described above, a part of which increased the related contract asset (which is included in other current assets versus accounts receivable). Revenue increased in the nine-month period of 2024, but at a lower rate than the nine-month period of 2023, resulting in a smaller accounts receivable balance increase. Accounts payable and other liabilities net of capital items decreased by 1.2 million during the nine-month period of 2024 and decreased 0.3 million during the nine-month period of 2023, representing a 0.9 million unfavorable cash flow swing, mainly due to an increase in the amount paid in 2024 for the 2023 short-term incentive bonus plan as compared to the amount paid in 2023 for the 2022 short-term incentive bonus plan. The increase in inventories during 2023 reflected the higher revenue growth during that period. The 2024 decrease in other assets was due to lower long-term lease receivables due to customer payments received and a decrease in the amount of equipment sales on leases during 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Investing Cash Flow. Net cash used in investing activities was 10.0 million for the nine-month period of 2024 compared to 5.7 million for the nine-month period of 2023, an increase of 4.3 million. The increase was due to an increase totaling 3.6 million in cash used to purchase medical equipment and other property and equipment during the nine-month period of 2024 compared to the nine-month period of 2023. Purchases of medical equipment were higher during 2024 compared to 2023 because a higher portion of the revenue growth in 2024 came from rental revenues that require capital equipment purchases. 
 Financing Cash Flow. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine-month period of 2024 was 2.4 million compared to 0.9 million for the nine-month period of 2023. The amount of cash flow used by financing activities during 2024 included net revolving line of credit repayments under the 2021 Credit Agreement totaling 1.2 million, cash used to satisfy statutory withholding on employee stock based compensation plans totaling 0.6 million and 1.0 million to repurchase the Company's common stock. These cash uses were partially offset by cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan proceeds totaling 0.4 million. Cash used by financing activities during 2023 primarily related to net revolving line of credit repayments under the 2021 Credit Agreement totaling 0.4 million, 0.2 million in debt issuance costs related to the First Amendment to the 2021 Credit Agreement, cash used to satisfy statutory withholding on employee stock based compensation plans totaling 1.1 million and 0.2 million to repurchase the Company's common stock. These were partially offset by 1.0 million in cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan proceeds combined. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. The critical accounting estimates that affect the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with those described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed 

Table of Contents 

 with the SEC on April 10, 2024. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and short-term interest rates. Market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our debt obligations under our 2021 Credit Agreement. Foreign currency exchange risks are attributable to sales to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers not denominated in our functional currency, which is the U.S. Dollar ("USD") and include exposures primarily to the Canadian Dollar. 
 The Company periodically enters into derivative contracts with the objective of managing its financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the financial instruments used to hedge them. We did not have any foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding at any time during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The maximum length of time over which we hedge our exposure to short-term interest rate risk is equal to the remaining term for the debt obligation being hedged. We had interest rate derivative contracts with a notional value of 20.0 million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Our hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis to be designated for hedge accounting treatment. For derivative contracts, which can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income is recorded in earnings in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. We record the ineffective portion of interest rate hedging instruments, if any, to interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for information related to the fair values of derivative instruments in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and information related to the effect of derivative instruments included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income including the amount of unrealized gains or (losses) associated with our interest rate derivatives reported in accumulated other comprehensive income that was reclassified into earnings during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The Company uses an income approach to value derivative instruments, analyzing quoted market prices to calculate the forward values and then discounting such forward values to the present value using benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the instrument s full term. 
 In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") announced its intent to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021, and the administrator of LIBOR announced its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two month USD LIBOR settings immediately following December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The one week and two month USD LIBOR settings were last published on December 31, 2021. Additionally, it is expected that banks no longer issue LIBOR-based debt after December 31, 2021. Accordingly, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of such rates beyond these dates. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee ("ARRC") has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to USD LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to USD LIBOR. On April 26, 2023, the Company amended its 2021 Credit Agreement with the First Amendment, discussed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, to provide for the replacement of LIBOR with Term SOFR as a benchmark interest rate. Prior to the First Amendment, net revolving loans under the 2021 Credit Agreement were indexed to USD LIBOR. As discussed in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, on May 11, 2023, the Company settled its two outstanding interest rate swap agreements, which were indexed to USD LIBOR, and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement indexed to SOFR to coincide with the index change in the 2021 Credit Agreement, as amended. The new swap agreement has a notional value of 20 million, which is equal to the combined notional value of the two settled swap agreements. The term of the new swap agreement, which matches the April 26, 2028 expiration date of the 2021 Credit Agreement, as amended, extends past the term of the settled swap agreements by approximately 26 months. Because of the hedging relationships, a change of 50 in the market rate of SOFR would not have a material impact on our financial results.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our CEO and CFO have evaluated these disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and have determined that such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness described below. 
 Ongoing Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weakness 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 As previously disclosed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company identified a material weakness in that we did not design and maintain effective internal controls over the completeness and accuracy of our accrual for employee travel and expenses. 
 Management designed and implemented controls, including additional reconciliation procedures, that address the completeness and accuracy of our employee travel and expense accrual balance. 
 
 These controls have operated effectively for a sufficient period during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Accordingly, the material weakness was determined to be remediated as of September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, as previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we are implementing measures designed to ensure that the control deficiency contributing to the previously disclosed material weakness is remediated, such that the controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The Company is in the process of designing and implementing controls that will improve the Company's ongoing application of US GAAP related to revenue recognition for the Company's rental revenue contracts under ASC Topic 842, Leases and ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . These remediation actions remain in process in addition to further modifications deemed necessary to address the material weakness. 
 The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Management believes the remediation of this material weakness will be completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2024. However, there is no assurance as to when such remediation will be completed. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than described above, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, the outcomes of which may not be determinable. The results of litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in diversion of significant resources. We are not able to estimate an aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses for those legal matters for which losses are not probable and estimable, primarily for the following reasons: (i) many of the relevant legal proceedings are in preliminary stages and until such proceedings develop further, there is often uncertainty regarding the relevant facts and circumstances at issue and potential liability; and (ii) many of these proceedings involve matters of which the outcomes are inherently difficult to predict. We have insurance policies covering potential losses where such coverage is cost effective. 

Table of Contents 

 We are not at this time involved in any proceedings that we believe could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 For information regarding factors that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, refer to the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 10, 2024. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer 
 A summary of our purchases of our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows: 
 Period Total Number of Shares Purchased (a) Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (b) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (in thousands) (b) July 1, 2024 through July 31, 2024 118 6.90 19,717,707 August 1, 2024 through August 31, 2024 23,535 6.50 23,535 19,564,820 September 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 84,996 6.42 84,996 19,019,299 Total 108,649 6.44 108,531 
 (a) Of the 108,649 shares of common stock presented in the table above, 118 shares were originally granted to employees and directors as stock options and restricted stock awards. Our stock plans allow for the withholding of shares to satisfy tax obligations due upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. Pursuant to our stock plans, the 118 shares reflected above were relinquished by employees or directors in exchange for our agreement to pay U.S. federal, state and local tax withholding obligations resulting from the exercise of the Company's stock options and vesting of the Company's restricted stock. 
 (b) On May 16, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (the "Share Repurchase Program") authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 20.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock through June 30, 2026, which was announced on May 20, 2024. The Share Repurchase Program supersedes the previous authorization, which was set to expire on June 30, 2024. Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program will be subject to market conditions, the periodic capital needs of the Company's operating activities, and the continued satisfaction of all covenants under the Company's existing credit agreement. Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan. The Share Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase shares and may be suspended, terminated, or modified at any time. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased 149,670 shares under the Share Repurchase Program. The Company had repurchased 553,149 shares under the previous authorization .
