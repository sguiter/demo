The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula. Expected volatilities
and risk-free interest rates are based upon the expected life of the grant. The interest rates used are the U.S. Treasury yield curve
in effect at the time of the grant. 

During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, options were granted, with of the options vesting at the respective grant date,
 vesting in December 2023, and vesting in December 2024. At the date of grant, expected volatility was , a risk-free
rate of , expected dividends, and an expected term of . 

The
expected term was determined based on the reasoning that all previously granted options have been held to expiration. Additionally, all
5 members who were granted options are board members or an officer, and the expectation is that they are holding these options to expiration
or until any such liquidation event would take place which is not estimable. 

As

square foot facility in Cranford, New Jersey. The
facility housed the Company s administrative offices, a warehouse, walk-in freezer and refrigerator, and a product development
laboratory and test kitchen. The Company s original lease agreement expired on July 1, 1999, but it continued to occupy the premises
on a monthly basis. In September, the company left the lease and derecognized the associated right of use asset and liability. Rent expense
was and for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and and for the thirty-nine weeks ended
September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company also rents warehouse storage space at various outside facilities.
Outside warehouse expenses were . for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and for the thirteen weeks ended September 30,
2023, and and for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company rents a
copier and mail machine under a finance lease. In 2022, the Company entered into a copier and mail
machine lease, which still exists as of September 28, 2024 . Payments for the copier and mail machine amounted to and for
the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively and and for the thirty-nine weeks ended September
28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

We
recently signed a five -year lease to move our offices into a one-story facility in Edison, New Jersey. The lease commenced on July 1
2024, with an . We completed the move into the new facility in September 2024. The square foot facility houses
our administrative offices, a warehouse, freezers, and refrigerators. 

Under
Topic 842, operating lease expense is generally recognized evenly over the term of the lease. The standard requires a lessee to record
a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the inception of the lease. The current portion of lease liabilities is included
in accrued expenses on the condensed balance sheets. 

Under
Topic 842, finance lease cost includes amortization, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the leased
asset, and interest expense, which is recognized following an effective interest rate method. The Company has a finance lease consisting
of a copier lease with a term of four years. The standard requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease
liability at the inception of the lease. 

The
Company s lease agreements generally do not provide an implicit borrowing rate; therefore, an internal incremental borrowing rate
is determined based on information available at lease commencement date for purposes of determining the present value of lease payments.
At the time of adoption of Topic 842, the Company used the incremental borrowing rate of for all leases that commenced prior to
that date.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected our financial position and
operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. 

The
discussion and analysis which follows in this Quarterly Report and in other reports and documents and in oral statements made on our
behalf by our management and others may contain trend analysis and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial results. These include
statements regarding our earnings, projected growth and forecasts, and similar matters which are not historical facts. We remind stockholders
that forward-looking statements are merely predictions and therefore are inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors which
could cause the actual future events or results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. These uncertainties
and other factors include, among other things, business conditions in the food industry and general economic conditions, both domestic
and international; lower than expected customer orders; competitive factors; changes in product mix or distribution channels; and resource
constraints encountered in developing new products. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report and made elsewhere
by or on our behalf should be considered in light of these factors. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding
of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment, with financial
reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical
accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely
develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. 

Revenue
Recognition. We primarily sell vegan and dairy-free soy-based cheeses and frozen desserts. We recognize revenue when control over
the products transfers to our customers, deemed to be the performance obligation, which generally occurs when the product is shipped
or picked up from one of our distribution locations by the customer. We account for product shipping, handling and insurance as fulfillment
activities with revenues for these activities recorded within net revenue and costs recorded within cost of sales. Revenues are recorded
net of trade and sales incentives and estimated product returns. Known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments, such as trade discounts,
rebates or returns, are estimated at the time of sale. We base these estimates of expected amounts principally on historical utilization
and redemption rates. Estimates that affect revenue, such as trade incentives and product returns, are monitored and adjusted each period
until the incentives or product returns are realized. 

Key
sales terms, such as pricing and quantities ordered, are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related
incentives have a one year or shorter duration. As such, we do not capitalize contract inception costs and we capitalize product fulfillment
costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our inventory policies. We generally do not have any unbilled receivables at the end of a period. 

Accounts
Receivable . The majority of our accounts receivables are due from distributors (domestic and international) and retailers. Management
closely monitors outstanding balances during the year and allocates an allowance account if appropriate. The Company estimates and records
a provision for its expected credit losses related to its financial instruments, including its trade receivables and contract assets.
The Company considers historical collection rates, the current financial status of its customers, macroeconomic factors, and other industry-specific
factors when evaluating for current expected credit losses. Forward-looking information is also considered in the evaluation of current
expected credit losses. However, because of the short time to the expected receipt of accounts receivable, the Company believes that
the carrying value, net of expected losses, approximates fair value and therefore, relies more on historical and current analysis of
such financial instruments. 

12 

Inventory.
 Inventory is stated at lower of cost or net realizable value determined by first in first out (FIFO) method. Inventories in excess
of future demand are written down and charged to the provision for inventories. At the point of which loss is recognized, a new, lower
cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase
in the newly established cost basis. 

Leases.
 Under Topic 842, operating lease expense is generally recognized evenly over the term of the lease. We have operating leases primarily
consisting of facilities with remaining lease terms of approximately one to three years. Leases with an initial term of twelve months
or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842, we have
combined the lease and non-lease components in determining the lease liabilities and right of use assets. 

Income
Taxes . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded if there is uncertainty as to the realization of deferred
tax assets. We will recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management s assessment
is that the position is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction
based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term tax position refers to a position in a previously filed
tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standard Updates ASUs ). ASUs not discussed below were
assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company s balance sheets or statements
of operations. 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The
ASU is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment
expenses. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09).
ASU 2023-09 requires that an entity, on an annual basis, disclose additional income tax information, primarily related to the rate reconciliation
and income taxes paid. The amendment in the ASU is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures.
The ASU s amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact that adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on its financial statements. 

Results
of Operations 

Thirteen
Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 Compared with Thirteen Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
sales for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 decreased by 529,000, or 21 , to 1,986,000, from net sales of 2,515,000 for
the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. Sales of our vegan cheese products decreased to 1,648,000 in the thirteen weeks ended September
28, 2024 from 2,110,000 in the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. Sales of our frozen dessert products decreased to 338,000 in
the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 405,000 for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the sales
of our vegan cheese products was due to the continued introduction of competitive products in the vegan cheese category and a decline
of our export cheese business. The decrease in frozen dessert product sales was due to a decrease in sales of our frozen dessert pints. 

13 

Our
gross profit was 485,000 for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and 786,000 for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023.
Our gross profit percentage decreased to 24 for the thirteen weeks ending September 28, 2024 compared to 31 for the thirteen weeks
ending September 30, 2023. Our gross profit and gross profit percentage were negatively impacted by the decrease in frozen dessert product
sales, and was due to a decrease in sales of our vegan cheese products and frozen dessert pints and increased promotional activity to
combat the increased competition in the vegan cheese market. We anticipate that our gross profit and gross profit percentage will remain
lower than in 2023 for the remainder of 2024. 

Freight
expense, a significant part of our cost of sales, decreased by 17,000, or 10 , to 156,000 for the thirteen weeks ended September 28,
2024 compared with 173,000 for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in freight expense was due to the decrease
in sales. Freight expense was 8 of sales for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 compared to 6 of sales for the thirteen weeks
ended September 30, 2023. We anticipate our freight expense, as a percentage of sales, will remain slightly higher than that of 2023
for the balance of this year. 

Selling
and warehouse expenses decreased slightly by 3,000, or 1 , to 207,000 for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 210,000
for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to decreases in commission expense of 10,000, meetings and convention
expense of 11,000, and sample shipping expenses of 3,000 which were partially offset by an increase in outside warehouse rental expenses
of 5,000, an increase in payroll expense of 5,000, and an increase in travel, entertainment, and auto expense of 10,000. The decrease
in commission expense is due to the decrease in sales for the thirteen-weeks ended September 28, 2024 compared with the thirteen-weeks
ended September 30, 2023. 

Marketing
expenses decreased by 20,000, or 19 , to 83,000 for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 103,000 for the thirteen weeks
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in artwork and plates expense of 3,000 and advertising expense
of 18,000. We anticipate that our marketing expenses for the balance of this year will be comparable to the corresponding periods in
fiscal 2023. 

Product
development costs were 28,000 for both the thirteen week periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. We anticipate our
product development costs for the remainder of 2024 will continue at a lower level than the corresponding 2023 period as we have reduced
our research and development work. 

General
and administrative expenses increased by 41,000, or 12 , to 374,000 for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 333,000 for
the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in payroll expense of 8,000, office supply expense of 11,000,
security and fire alarm expense of 9,000, and building rental expense of 19,000, equipment rental expense of 4,000 and general insurance
expense of 6,000, which were partially offset by a decrease in IT expense of 10,000 and professional and outside services expense of
 10,000. Building rent, security and fire alarm, and office expenses increased due to additional expenses associated with the move to
our new facility. These are one-time expenses that will be offset by future savings in operational expenses. 

Income
tax expense was 0 for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and 1,000 for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023.

Thirty
Nine Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 Compared with Thirty Nine Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 decreased by 1,243,000, or 16 , to 6,481,000, from net sales of 7,724,000
for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. Sales of our vegan cheese products decreased to 5,383,000 in the thirty-nine weeks
ended September 28, 2024 from 6,492,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. Sales of our frozen dessert products decreased
to 1,098,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 1,232,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023.
The significant reduction in sales for the current thirty-nine week period was primarily due to the decrease in our vegan cheese sales
caused by increased competition in the vegan cheese category and a decline in our export cheese business. 

Our
gross profit decreased to 1,621,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 2,059,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended
September 30, 2023, while our gross profit percentage was 25 for the thirty-nine weeks ending September 28, 2024 compared to 27 for
the thirty-nine weeks ending September 30, 2023. The decrease in our gross profit and gross profit percentage was due to the reduction
in sales. 

Freight
expense, a significant part of our cost of sales, decreased by 98,000, or 16 , to 513,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September
28, 2024 compared with 611,000 for the thirty-nine weeks September 30, 2023 due to the reduction in sales. Freight expense was 8 of
sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. 

Selling
and warehouse expenses decreased by 131,000, or 16 , to 671,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 802,000 for
the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in meetings and convention expense
of 55,000, commission expense of 86,000, bad debt expense of 15,000, and sample shipping expenses of 26,000, which were partially
offset by an increase in outside warehouse rental expenses of 25,000, payroll expenses of 15,000, and travel, entertainment, and auto
expenses of 11,000. The decrease in commission expense is due to the decrease in sales and a reduction to the commission rate we pay
to our brokers from 5 to 4 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 compared with the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30,
2023. 

Marketing
expenses increased slightly by 10,000, or 3 , to 297,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 287,000 for the thirty-nine
weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in promotions expense of 36,000, point of sale material
expense of 16,000 and artwork and plate expense of 5,000, which were partially offset by decreases in advertising expense of 11,000,
and public relations expense of 5,000. 

Product
development costs were 92,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and 111,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in professional fees and outside services expenses of 11,000 and lab costs and
supplies expense of 8,000. 

General
and administrative expenses increased by 8 , or 79,000, to 1,097,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 1,018,000
for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in payroll expense of 28,000, security
and fire alarm expense of 9,000, office supply expense of 19,000, equipment repairs expense of 5,000, telephone expense of 5,000,
building rental expense of 27,000, and general insurance expense of 12,000, which were partially offset by decreases in public relations
expense of 19,000, IT expense of 9,000, and stock option expense of 7,000. Our increase in payroll expense was due primarily to an
increase in group insurance expense. 

Income
tax expense was 5,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and 148,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30,
2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 28, 2024, we had approximately 176,000 in cash and our working capital was approximately 2,961,000, compared with approximately
 837,000 in cash and working capital of 3,440,000 at December 30, 2023.

Net
cash used in operating activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 was 661,000 compared to 345,000 used in operating
activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended
September 28, 2024 was primarily a result of the net loss of 528,000 and decreases in current liabilities of 501,000, which were partially
offset by decreases in inventories of 345,000. 

We
believe our existing cash on hand at September 28, 2024, existing working capital and the cash flows expected from operations, will be
sufficient to support our operating and capital requirements during the next twelve months. 

Inflation
and Seasonality 

We
do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding two years. There can be no
assurance, however, that our operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future. Our business is subject to minimal seasonal
variations with slightly increased sales historically in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. We expect to continue to experience
slightly higher sales in the second and third quarters, and slightly lower sales in the fourth and first quarters, as a result of reduced
sales of dairy free frozen desserts during those periods 

Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements 

None. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
had no material contractual obligations as of September 28, 2024. 

Recently

See
Note 2 to the unaudited condensed financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
do not believe that our exposure to market risk related to the effect of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
commodity prices and other market risks with regard to instruments entered into for trading or for other purposes is material.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of September 28, 2024, our Company s chief executive and financial officer conducted
an evaluation regarding the effectiveness of our Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon the evaluation of these controls and procedures, our chief executive and financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 28, 2024. 

Disclosure
Controls and Internal Controls. As provided in Rule 13a-14 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, Disclosure Controls are defined as meaning controls and procedures that are designed with the objective of insuring
that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ), is recorded, processed, designed and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
Controls include, within the definition under the Exchange Act, and without limitation, controls and procedures to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in our reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. Internal Controls are procedures which
are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions are properly authorized; (2) our assets are
safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly recorded and reported, all to permit the preparation
of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of the
interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management s
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting includes using the COSO framework, an integrated framework for the evaluation
of internal controls issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, to identify the risks and control
objectives related to the evaluation of our control environment. 

Based
on the evaluation under the frameworks described above, Mr. Kass, our chief executive and chief financial officer, has concluded that
our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of September 28, 2024 because of the following material weaknesses in
internal controls over financial reporting: 

A continuing lack of sufficient
 resources and an insufficient level of monitoring and oversight, which may restrict our ability to gather, analyze and report information
 relative to the financial statements, including but not limited to accounting estimates, reserves, allowances, and income tax matters,
 in a timely manner. 

The limited size of the
 accounting department makes it impracticable to achieve an optimum separation of duties and monitoring of internal controls. 

To
date, we have been unable to remediate these weaknesses, which stem from our small workforce of five persons at September 28, 2024.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
