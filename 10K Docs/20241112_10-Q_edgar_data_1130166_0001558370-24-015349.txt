 million as of September 30, 2024, will allow it to meet its liquidity requirements into the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company s history of losses, negative cash flows from operations, liquidity resources currently on hand, and its dependence on the ability to obtain additional financing to fund its operations after the current resources are exhausted, about which there can be no certainty, have resulted in the assessment that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements. While the Company has plans in place to mitigate this risk, which primarily consist of raising additional capital through equity financing or by entering into a strategic transaction, there is no guarantee that it will be successful in these mitigation efforts. In the event that we are not able to secure funding, we may be forced to curtail operations, delay or stop ongoing development activities, cease operations altogether, and/or file for bankruptcy. On August 26, 2024, the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq determined that the Company was not in compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Equity Rule because the Company reported stockholders equity of less than 2.5 million as of June 30, 2024. The notice from the Staff further stated that unless the Company timely requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ), the Company s securities would be subject to delisting. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a stockholders equity deficit of approximately million which is not in compliance with the Equity Rule. On October 15, 2024, the Company met with the Panel regarding the Company s potential delisting from Nasdaq as a result of its violation of the Equity Rule. On October 22, 2024, the Company received the Panel s decision which granted the Company until December 24, 2024 to regain compliance with the Equity Rule and all applicable criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq. If the Company is unable to regain compliance with the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market by December 24, 2024, the Company s securities may be delisted from Nasdaq. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

 Overview We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative cancer medicines based on cell cycle, transcriptional regulation, epigenetics and mitosis control biology. We reported revenue of 10,000 and 43,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and revenues of 16,000 and 389,000 for the comparable three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We do not expect to report a significant amount of revenue for the foreseeable future. Our primary focus has been on the development of our transcriptional regulation program, which is evaluating fadraciclib, a CDK2/9 inhibitor, in solid tumors and hematological malignancies . The anti-mitotic program is evaluating plogosertib, a PLK1 inhibitor, in advanced cancers. We currently retain all marketing rights worldwide to the compounds associated with our drug programs. Fadraciclib Phase 1/2 Study in Advanced Solid Tumors and Lymphoma (065-101; NCT#04983810 In this ongoing study, a total of 47 heavily pretreated patients have been dosed in the Phase 1 part of the 065-101 study through eight dose levels. Clinical, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data from the study were presented at a poster at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. Patients received a median of four prior lines of therapy. Fadraciclib was generally well tolerated with good compliance between dose levels 1 and 5. The most common treatment related adverse events reported were nausea (66.0 ), vomiting (46.8 ), diarrhea (31.9 fatigue (25.5 ), and hyperglycemia (21.3 ). A total of 25 drug-related serious adverse events (SAE) were reported in 8 patients. The most common SAEs reported were hyperglycemia (n=4), platelet count decrease (n=3), and accidental overdose (n=3). There were no drug-related SAEs at dose level 5 (100 mg bid, 5 days a week, for 4/4 weeks) which was selected for the Phase 2 proof of concept part of the 065-101 study. PKs were dose-proportional and exceeded the preclinical efficacy targets for both CDK2 and CDK9. PDs evaluated in peripheral blood showed suppression of CDKN2A/B by four hours post treatment in most patients who received 100 mg bid or higher. A total of 34 patients had measurable target lesions at baseline. Two partial responses were reported in patients with T-cell lymphoma, one of whom had CDKN2A loss. A squamous non-small cell lung (NSCLC) cancer patient with CDKN2A and CDKN2B loss achieved 22 reduction in tumor burden at 4 weeks per RECIST 1.1 criteria. In addition, clinical benefit was reported in two patients with endometrial cancer and one each with ovarian and pancreatic cancers. The primary objectives of the 065-101 study in the Phase 1 dose escalation stage are to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or RP2D and in the Phase 2, Proof of Concept stage to evaluate preliminary efficacy of fadraciclib as measured by overall response rate (ORR). The secondary objectives in dose escalation are to assess safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and ORR, while in Phase 2, Proof of Concept, to assess safety and tolerability, evaluate disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The study is utilizing a Simon two-stage optimal design to evaluate clinical activity. Exploratory objectives include investigation of clinical pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacogenomics (PGx). The Phase 2, part of the study is ongoing and two dose expansion cohorts are enrolling patients with mechanistically relevant biomarkers, including CDKN2A and/or CDKN2B mutation or deletion or T-cell lymphoma. Cohort 8 prospectively enrolled 12 patients with known CDKNA/B genetic alterations between April and September 2024. The rationale was to further evaluate observations of clinical activity in Phase 1 patients with known CDNK2A or CDKN2B genetic alterations. Cohort 6 is enrolling patients with T-cell Lymphoma with two patients treated so far. The rationale was to further evaluate observations of partial response (PR) in 2/3 Phase 1 patients with T-cell lymphoma. Certain T-Cell lymphomas are known to harbor CDNK2A genetic alterations. All patients were treated with oral fadraciclib 100mg BID, M-F, week 1-4 in 28-day cycles which was the Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

 Interim data from the Phase 2 was presented as a poster at the 2024 EORTC-NCI-AACR 36 th Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in Barcelona, Spain in October, 2024. The data showed that fadraciclib was well tolerated in Cohort 8. Most common drug-related adverse events included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and were similar to those seen at this dose in Phase 1. There were no Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events in the Phase 2 study this far, consistent with the Phase 1 data. The majority of patients (12/14) had ECOG performance status of 1 and median number of prior therapies was 3. In Cohort 8, four patients had pancreatic cancer, and one each cholangiocarcinoma, duodenal, melanoma, cervical, laryngeal, ovarian, squamous cell cancer with unknown primary (CUP) and thymus cancer. Out of six patients evaluable for efficacy, two achieved stable disease: a melanoma patient whose treatment duration was 125 days and a squamous cell CUP patient who achieved 11 tumor shrinkage in the sum of all lesions on first scan with treatment duration of over 85 days (ongoing). Two additional patients with ovarian and laryngeal cancer are ongoing but have not had their first scan yet. The most common molecular characteristics of Cohort 8 patients were loss of function or deletion of CDKN2A and/or CDKN2B tumor suppressor genes. Other pharmacogenomic observations included CDKN2A/B, KRAS and/or TP53 mutations. Fadraciclib tablets can be given orally with repeat dosing which has led to transient suppression of anti-apoptosis proteins with generally good tolerability and no Grade 3 or higher hematological toxicity in the first cycle. We believe that fadraciclib s inhibition of CDK2 and CDK9 may be superior to inhibiting either CDK2 or CDK9 alone. Plogosertib Phase 1/2 Study in Advanced Solid Tumors and Lymphoma (140-101; NCT# 05358379 This open-label Phase 1/2 registration-directed study uses a streamlined design and initially seeks to determine the RP2D for single-agent oral plogosertib in a dose escalation stage. Once RP2D has been established, the study will enter into proof-of-concept, cohort stage, using a Simon 2-stage design. In this stage plogosertib will be administered to patients in up to seven mechanistically relevant cohorts including patients with bladder, breast, colorectal (including KRAS mutant), hepatocellular and biliary tract, and lung cancers (both small cell and non-small cell), as well as lymphomas. An additional basket cohort will enroll patients with biomarkers relevant to the drug s mechanism, including MYC amplified tumors. The protocol allows for expansion of individual cohorts based on response which may allow acceleration of the clinical development and registration plan for plogosertib. Fifteen patients have been treated at the first five dose escalation levels with no dose limiting toxicities observed. Stable disease has been observed in pretreated patients with gastrointestinal, lung, and ovarian cancers. A new, alternative salt, oral formulation of plogosertib with improved bioavailability is under development. Going Concern For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used net cash of 6.6 million to fund our operating activities. We have cash and cash equivalents of 3.0 million as of September 30, 2024, will allow it to meet its liquidity requirements into the fourth quarter of 2024. However, there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently investigating ways to raise additional capital through private equity financing or by entering into a strategic transaction. In the event that we are not able to secure funding, we may be forced to curtail operations, delay or stop ongoing development activities, cease operations altogether, and/or file for bankruptcy. On August 26, 2024, the Staff of Nasdaq determined that we were not in compliance with the Equity Rule because we reported stockholders equity of less than 2.5 million as of June 30, 2024. The notice from the Staff further stated that unless we timely requested a hearing before a Panel, our securities would be subject to delisting. As of September 30, 2024, we had a stockholders equity deficit of approximately 0.97 million which is not in compliance with the Equity Rule. On October 15, 2024, we met with the Panel regarding our potential delisting from Nasdaq as a result of our violation of the Equity Rule. On October 22, 2024, we received the Panel s decision which granted us until

 December 24, 2024 to regain compliance with the Equity Rule and all applicable criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq. If we are unable to regain compliance with the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market by December 24, 2024, our securities may be delisted from Nasdaq. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our key liquidity measures as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in 000s): 

September 30, 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 2,982 5,944 Working capital: Current assets 4,913 11,113 Current liabilities (6,351) (8,148) Total working capital (1,438) 2,965 
 Since our inception, we have relied primarily on the proceeds from sales of common and preferred equity securities to finance our operations and internal growth. Additional funding has come through research and development tax credits, government grants, the sale of product rights, interest on investments and licensing revenue. We have incurred significant losses since our inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 436.4 million. Cash Flows Cash from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is summarized as follows (in 000s): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (6,634) (12,202) Net cash used in investing activities (6) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 6,209 (151) 
 Operating activities Net cash used in operating activities decreased by 5.6 million, from 12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in cash used by operating activities was primarily the result of a decrease in net loss of 9.1 million, brought about by a reduction in clinical trial supply and non-clinical activities, offset by a change in working capital of 2.9 million. Investing activities Net cash used by investing activities remained inconsequential for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and consisted of IT-related capital expenditure in 2023. 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 Financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a direct result of receiving approximately 6.2 million, net of expenses, from the issuance of common stock and warrants under a Securities Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor. Net cash used in financing activities was 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of dividend payments of approximately 0.2 million to the holders of our 6 Preferred Stock. Funding Requirements and Going Concern We do not currently have sufficient funds to complete development and commercialization of any of our drug candidates. Current business and capital market risks could have a detrimental effect on the availability of sources of funding and our ability to access them in the future, which may delay or impede our progress of advancing our drugs currently in the clinical pipeline to approval by the Food and Drug Administration FDA or European Medicines Agency EMA for commercialization. Additionally, we plan to continue to evaluate in-licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain access to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy. Any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future. 

Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to: the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities; the costs associated with establishing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities; the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses, product candidates and technologies; the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA and EMA approvals; the effect of competing technological and market developments; and the economic and other terms and timing of any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or strategic collaborations. Although we are not reliant on institutional credit finance and therefore not subject to debt covenant compliance requirements or potential withdrawal of credit by banks, we are reliant on the availability of funds and activity in equity markets. We do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or make changes to our operating plan, which may include ceasing operations altogether and/or filing for bankruptcy. In addition, we may have to partner one or more of our product candidate programs at an earlier stage of development, which would lower the economic value of those programs to us. Since our inception, we have relied primarily on the proceeds from sales of common and preferred equity securities to finance our operations and internal growth. Additional funding has come through research and development tax credits, government grants, the sale of product rights, interest on investments, licensing revenue, royalty income, and a limited amount of product revenue from operations discontinued in September 2012. As discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements accompanying this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, under ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern , management is required at each reporting period to evaluate whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the 

 26 

Table of Contents 
 financial statements are issued. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued. Our history of losses, our negative cash flows from operations, our liquidity resources currently on hand, and our dependence on the ability to obtain additional financing to fund our operations after the current resources are exhausted, about which there can be no certainty, have resulted in our assessment that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the issuance date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We are currently investigating ways to raise additional capital through private equity financing or by entering into a strategic transaction. In the event that we are not able to secure funding, we may be forced to curtail operations, delay or stop ongoing development activities, cease operations altogether, and/or file for bankruptcy. In such event, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in our company. Results of Operations Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenues We recognized 10,000 and 43,000 of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. This revenue is related to recovery of clinical manufacturing costs associated with an investigator sponsored study managed by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Revenues recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were approximately 16,000 and 389,000 respectively. The future We expect to completely fulfill our obligations under this agreement by the fourth quarter of 2024. The associated clinical manufacturing costs are presented as a component of research and development expenses. Research and Development Expenses From our inception, we have focused on drug discovery and development programs, with a particular emphasis on orally available anticancer agents, and our research and development expenses have represented costs incurred to discover and develop novel small molecule therapeutics, including clinical trial costs for fadraciclib and plogosertib . We have also incurred costs in the advancement of product candidates toward clinical and preclinical trials and the development of in-house research to advance our biomarker program and technology platforms. We expense all research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expenses primarily include: Clinical trial and regulatory-related costs; Payroll and personnel-related expenses, including consultants and contract research organizations; Preclinical studies, supplies and materials; Technology license costs; Stock-based compensation; and Rent and facility expenses for our offices.

 Total research and development expenses represented 56 and 76 of our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. Research and development expenses decreased by 9.9 million from 15.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Expenditure for the transcriptional regulation program decreased by 6.6 million relative to the respective comparative period, primarily due to decreases in manufacturing and non-clinical expenditure. Research and development expenses relating to plogosertib decreased by 2.7 million relative to the respective comparative period due to decreases in manufacturing and non-clinical expenditure. The future We anticipate that overall research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 will decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 as we do not expect to incur further manufacturing or preclinical costs. Expenditure will be primarily clinical trial costs related to our fadraciclib Phase 1/2 065-101 study in advanced solid tumors and lymphomas. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses include costs for administrative personnel, legal and other professional expenses and general corporate expenses. The following table summarizes the general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in 000s except percentages): 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, Difference September 30, Difference 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total general and administrative expenses 1,237 1,625 (388) (24) 4,444 4,845 (401) (8) 
 Total general and administrative expenses represented 44 and 24 of our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 0.3 million from 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due largely to reduction in stock compensation expense.

Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates to royalties receivable under a December 2005 Asset Purchase Agreement, or APA, whereby Xcyte Therapies, Inc., or Xcyte (a business acquired by us in March 2006) sold certain assets and intellectual property to ThermoFisher Scientific Company, or TSC (formerly Invitrogen Corporation) through the APA and other related agreements. The assets and technology were not part of our product development plan following the transaction between Xcyte and Cyclacel in March 2006. Accordingly, we presented 52,000 and 50,000 as other income arising from royalties from the APA during each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. Foreign exchange gains (losses) Foreign exchange gains increased by 64,000, from a loss of 58,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to a gain of 6,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The future Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2024, will continue to be impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and the receipt of income under the APA. As we are not in control of sales made by TSC, we are unable to estimate the level and timing of income under the APA, if any. Because the nature of funding advanced through intercompany loans is that of a long-term investment, unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on such funding will be recognized in other comprehensive income until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable. Foreign exchange gains and losses relating to intercompany operating expenditure, which is expected to be settled in the foreseeable future, will be recognized within the statement of operations. Income Tax Benefit Credit is taken for research and development tax credits, which are claimed from the United Kingdom s revenue and customs authority, or HMRC, in respect of qualifying research and development costs incurred.

 The following table summarizes total income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in 000s except percentages): 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, Difference September 30, Difference 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total income tax benefit 210 668 (458) (69) 1,976 2,574 (598) (23) 
 The total income tax benefit, which comprised of research and development tax credits recoverable, decreased by approximately 0.6 million, from 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The level of tax credits recoverable is linked directly to qualifying research and development expenditure incurred in any one year and the availability of trading losses. The future We expect to continue to be eligible to receive United Kingdom research and development tax credits for the year ended December 31, 2024 and will continue to elect to receive payment of the tax credit. The amount of tax credits we will receive is entirely dependent on the amount of eligible expenses we incur and could be restricted by any future cap introduced by HMRC. Beyond 2024, we cannot be certain of our eligibility to receive this tax credit or if eligible, the amount that may be received, as a result of any future changes by HMRC to the eligibility criteria.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our critical accounting policies are those policies which require the most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates, judgments, and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide information in response to this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2024, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Based upon such evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. Our remediation process is still ongoing and therefore cannot be considered fully complete at this time. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in remediating the material weaknesses. We plan to continue to assess internal controls and procedures and intend to take further action as necessary or appropriate to address any other matters as they are identified. Notwithstanding the identified material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, we have concluded that the consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods, presented, in conformity with GAAP. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot ensure that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings None. Item 1A. Risk Factors Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to our risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For a further discussion of our Risk Factors, refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. If we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. On March 27, 2024, we received a written notice (the Notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires companies listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain a minimum of 2,500,000 in stockholders equity for continued listing (the Stockholders Equity Requirement ). Our stockholders equity was 607,000 as of December 31, 2023 and, as a result, we did not satisfy Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). We submitted a plan to Nasdaq s Listing Qualifications Staff Staff advising of actions we have taken or will take to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). On August 26, 2024, the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq determined that we were not in compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Equity Rule because we reported stockholders equity of less than 2.5 million as of June 30, 2024. The notice from the Staff further stated that unless we timely requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ), our securities would be subject to delisting. As of September 30, 2024, we had a stockholders equity deficit of approximately 1.02 million which is not in compliance with the Equity Rule. On October 15, 2024, we met with the Panel regarding our potential delisting from Nasdaq as a result of our violation of the Equity Rule. On October 22, 2024, we received the Panel s decision which granted us until December 24, 2024 to regain compliance with the Equity Rule and all applicable criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq. If we are unable to regain compliance with the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market by December 24, 2024, our securities may be delisted from Nasdaq. If, for any reason, Nasdaq were to delist our securities from trading on its exchange and we are unable to obtain listing on another reputable national securities exchange, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could materially adversely affect our stockholders: the liquidity and marketability of our common stock; the market price of our common stock; our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations; the number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in our common stock; the number of market makers in our common stock; the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock; and the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock. In addition, if we cease to be eligible to trade on Nasdaq, we may have to pursue trading on a less recognized or accepted market, such as the over the counter markets, our stock may be traded as a penny stock, which would make transactions in our stock more difficult and cumbersome, and we may be unable to access capital on favorable terms or at all, as companies trading on alternative markets may be viewed as less attractive investments with higher associated
