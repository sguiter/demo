AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) . The Company has historically financed its operations primarily through the issuance of common stock, warrants, and debt. The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses and net cash outflows until such time as it generates a level of revenue to support its cost structure. There is no assurance that the Company will achieve profitable operations, and, if achieved, whether it will be sustained on a continued basis. The Company intends to fund ongoing activities by utilizing its current cash on hand and by raising additional capital through equity and/or debt financings. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising that additional capital or that such capital, if available, will be on terms that are acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional capital, the Company may be compelled to reduce the scope of its operations and planned capital expenditures. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of continuity of operations, realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business; no adjustments have been made relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not continue as a going concern. 9 Table of Contents Recently Announced Accounting Standards carries an annual percentage rate and will be paid down in nine equal monthly payments of beginning on March 10, 2024.

Overview: We are a research and development company operating in both the biotech and agtech sectors, with an intellectual property portfolio comprised of proprietary algal and bacterial strains, biologically active molecules and complexes, production techniques, cultivation techniques and patented or patent-pending inventions for applications in human and animal health. Biotech ZIVO Product Candidates ZIVO is developing bioactive compounds derived from its proprietary algal culture, targeting human and animal diseases, such as poultry coccidiosis, bovine mastitis, human cholesterol, and canine osteoarthritis. As part of its therapeutic strategy, ZIVO will continue to seek strategic partners for late stage development, regulatory preparation and commercialization of its products in key global markets. Review of isolated active materials derived from our proprietary algal culture and their potential treatment applications led us to identify a product candidate for treating coccidiosis in broiler chickens as the best option for most rapidly generating significant revenue because coccidiosis is a global poultry industry issue, and because the clinical testing cycle for chickens is shorter than for other species. Most of the global animal health companies have products for the coccidiosis market; however, they are mostly antibiotic- or ionophore-based with essentially no new technology having been introduced in the last 60 years. 18 Table of Contents Agtech - ZIVO s Algal Biomass ZIVO s algal biomass is currently produced in Peru. ZIVO s algal biomass contains Vitamin A, protein, iron, important fatty acids, non-starch polysaccharides and other micronutrients that position the product as a viable functional food ingredient and nutritional enhancement for human and animal use and as a viable functional ingredient for skin care products. Through our direction and technology, a site in Peru has been successful in consistently producing our proprietary algae. Our team has been working toward building commercial-scale algae ponds using a ZIVO proprietary design, and we are in the middle of a project to grow our algae in a penultimate scale pond. Once we are successful at this scale, we plan to invest in full commercial-scale ponds and product processing equipment. The Company currently has contracts for the sale and production of its algal biomass. ZIVO has engaged an independent distributor, ZWorldwide, Inc., who has begun to sell the product, branded Zivolife TM , with an initial focus on the North American green powder food market with the product being grown in Peru. Additional Indications Pending additional funding, ZIVO may also pursue the following indications: Biotech : o Bovine Mastitis : ZIVO is developing a treatment for bovine mastitis derived from its proprietary algal culture and the bioactive agents contained within. o Canine Joint Health : Studies have indicated the potential of a chondroprotective property when a compound fraction was introduced into ex vivo canine joint tissues. o Human Immune Modulation : Early human immune cell in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that one of the isolated and characterized biologically active molecules in the Company s portfolio may serve as an immune modulator with potential application in multiple disease situations. Agtech: o Companion Animal Food Ingredient : The self-affirmed GRAS process was completed for ZIVO algal biomass in late 2018 and updated in early 2023 to validate its suitability for human consumption as an ingredient in foods and beverages. We plan to leverage this work into viable food and nutritional supplements for companion animals. o Skin Health : ZIVO is developing its algal biomass as a skin health ingredient, the Company has engaged in some limited topical skin product testing started in the third quarter of 2020, and we plan to perform clinical efficacy claim studies planned for ingestible and topical products. 19 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes ZIVO s operating results for the periods indicated: Quarter ended September 30, 2024 2023 Total revenue: 31,500 11,800 Total cost of goods sold 22,050 7,670 Gross margin 9,450 4,130 Costs and expenses: Research and development 326,361 220,653 General and administrative 1,943,127 1,355,865 Total costs and expenses 2,269,487 1,576,518 Loss from operations (2,260,037 (1,572,388 Other (expense): Total other expense (8,560 (252,534 Net loss (2,268,597 (1,824,922 Revenue During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 31,500 in commercial revenue relating to sales of the Company s dried algal biomass product as a human food or food ingredient. This is an approximately 20,000 increase from the same period last year. The 20,000 increase is the result of increased product volume sold in the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same quarter last year. This increase in volume can be fully attributable to production capacity increases at our contract grower in Peru. Costs of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 22,050. This is approximately 14,000 higher than the same period last year, the increase was attributable to increased product volumes. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses were approximately 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 1.4 million for the comparable prior year period. The increase of approximately 600,000 in general and administrative expense during 2024 is due to an increase in labor related expenses of 295,000, an increase in professional services of 370,000, partially offset by a 75,000 decrease in other overhead costs. The 295,000 increase in labor related costs is fully explained by an increase in non-cash equity related compensation awarded by the Board of Directors to certain Company employees. The 370,000 year over year increase in professional services expense is primarily due to an increase in equity compensation awarded to the Board of Directors totaling approximately 500,000, which was partially offset by lower legal and consulting expenses of approximately 120,000. The 75,000 decrease in other overhead spending is attributable mostly to lower insurance, filing, and listing fees. Research and Development Expenses For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred approximately 325,000 in research and development expenses, as compared to approximately 220,000 for the comparable period in 2023. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s research and development spending included no amortization of deferred research and development. In the comparable prior year period the spending included approximately 190,000 of amortization of deferred research and development obligations for the participation agreements. 20 Table of Contents In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, excluding this amortization, the Company had gross research and development spending of approximately 325,000; an 85,000 increase in spending from the third quarter of 2023. Of these costs in the third quarter of 2024, 290,000 was attributable to labor and other internal research and development costs, a decrease of approximately 30,000 from the comparable prior year. The reduction is due 70,000 lower cash compensation and 10,000 in lower travel and entertainment and internal lab costs, partially offset by 50,000 higher non-cash compensation expense. Third party research and development spending of approximately 36,000 was 52,000 lower than the comparable prior year period due to a reduction in third party research studies.

The 67,220 for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 is an increase over the 15,850 in revenue in the same nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The approximately 51,500 increase is due to higher sales volumes fully attributable to production capacity increases at our contract grower in Peru. Costs of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 45,268. This is approximately 37,000 higher than the same period last year, explained by the increase in sales volume. 21 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses were approximately 8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase from the 4.3 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase of approximately 4.6 million in general and administrative expense during 2024 is explained by higher labor related costs of approximately 3.1 million and an increase in 1.7 million of professional services, partially offset by a reduction in other overhead of 190,000. The 3.1 million increase in labor related expenses is attributable to an increase in non-cash equity related employee compensation of 3.4 million partially offset by a reductions in bonus expense of 400,000. Professional services expense increases of 1.7 million were due to directors compensation increases of 2.4 million partially offset by lower legal 610,000) and accounting 135,000) that were elevated in the nine months ending September 30, 2023 as the Company undertook funding activities. The approximately 190,000 reduction in other overhead is attributable to a 70,000 reduction in insurance expense, lower filing and listing costs of 85,000, and a significant reduction in travel and entertainment expense of 30,000. Research and Development Expenses For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred approximately 2.9 million in research and development expenses, as compared to approximately 1.1 million in the comparable period in 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s research and development spending included no amortization of deferred research and development. In the comparable prior year period the spending included approximately 625,000 of amortization of deferred research and development obligations for the participation agreements. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, excluding this amortization, the Company had gross research and development spending of approximately 2.9 million; a 1.2 million increase in spending from the first nine months of 2023. Of these costs in the first nine months of 2024, approximately 2.8 million was related to labor and other internal lab costs, an increase of approximately 1.8 million from the comparable prior year, primarily attributable to an increase in non-cash compensation of 2.0 million. Third party research and development spending of approximately 65,000 was 635,000 lower than the comparable prior year period due to a pause in third party research studies. Nine months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Labor and other internal expenses 2,826,060 986,534 External research expenses 65,392 702,139 Total gross R D expenses 2,891,452 1,688,673 Less contra-expense for amortization of deferred R D obligation - participation agreements - (624,110 Research and development 2,891,452 1,064,563 Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, ZIVO s principal source of liquidity consisted of cash of 159,403. The Company expects to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating and net losses for the foreseeable future until and unless we generate an adequate level of revenue from potential commercial sales to cover expenses. The sources of cash to date have been limited proceeds from the issuance of notes with warrants, common stock with and without warrants and unsecured loans. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised approximately 3.2 million from direct sale of 662,550 shares of common stock in private transactions to qualified individuals. 22 Table of Contents June 2023 Registered Direct Offering and Private Placement In June 2023, the Company sold 171,666 shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per share, at an offering price of 16.02 per share, and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 78,021 shares of Common Stock at an offering price of 16.0194 per pre-funded warrant, to a single institutional investor. In a concurrent private placement, the Company also directly sold to the purchaser Series A Common Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 249,688 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of 16.80 per share and Series B Common Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 249,688 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of 16.80 per share.

The Series B Common Warrants are immediately exercisable, subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of the holder provided in the Series B Common Warrants, at any time on or after the date of issuance and will expire five years from the initial exercise date. The gross proceeds to the Company from the registered direct offering and concurrent private placement were approximately 4.0 million (before deducting the placement agent s fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company). 2023 and 2024 Private Direct Offerings In November 2023, the Board of Directors approved a direct private offering to raise capital to fund the Company s operations, the 2023 Private Offering. The funding program targeted a small number of existing investors and offered common stock for to be purchased at the market price as reported on the OTCQB exchange. Between December 5, 2023 and June 13, 2024 the Company sold 1,047,214 shares of stock in 37 separate transactions for proceeds of 2,348,325, an average of 2.24 per share. Of this total, related parties participated in 15 transactions for the purchase of 571,257 shares of stock yielding proceeds to the Company of 1,220,781, an average of 2.14 per share. None of the foregoing transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering. On June 10, 2024, the Board of Directors appointed a pricing committee of the board to establish an enhanced private direct offering which resulted in the 2024 Private Offering. This offering has a stock price based on the prior 30-day average closing price as reported on the OTCQB, and each investor will receive warrants to purchase common stock at a rate of 1 warrant share for every 10 common shares purchased. The warrants have the same strike price as the common stock for each purchase agreement, have a life of five years, and have provisions to allow for a cashless exercise. Since June 28, 2024, the Company has entered into 9 transactions under the 2024 Private Offering, resulting in the sale of 171,364 shares of commons stock and 17,134 warrant shares for proceeds of 1,414,474, an average of 8.25 per share. Three of these transactions were with related parties for 45,406 shares of common stock, 4,540 warrant shares, resulting in proceeds of 378,101, an average of 8.33 per share. None of the foregoing transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering. Participation Agreements From April 13, 2020, through May 14, 2021, the Company entered into twenty-one License Co-Development Participation Agreements (the Participation Agreements with certain accredited investors Participants for an aggregate of 2,985,000 in proceeds. The Participation Agreements provide for the issuance of warrants to such Participants and allows the Participants to participate in the fees (the Fees from licensing or selling bioactive ingredients or molecules derived from ZIVO s algae cultures. Specifically, ZIVO has agreed to provide to the Participants a 44.775 Revenue Share of all license fees generated by ZIVO from any licensee. The Participation Agreements allow the Company the option to buy back the right, title and interest in the Revenue Share for an amount equal to the amount funded plus a forty percent (40 premium, if the option is exercised less than 18 months following execution, and for either forty (40 or fifty percent (50 if the option is exercised more than 18 months following execution. Pursuant to the terms of twelve of the Participation Agreements, the Company may not exercise its option until it has paid the Participants a revenue share equal to a minimum of thirty percent (30 of the amount such Participant s total payment amount. Pursuant to the terms of the one of the Participation Agreements, the Company may not exercise its option until it has paid the Participant a revenue share equal to a minimum of one hundred forty percent (140 of the amount such Participant s total payment amount. Five of the Participation Agreements have no minimum threshold payment. Once this minimum threshold is met, the Company may exercise its option by delivering written notice to a Participant of its intent to exercise the option, along with repayment terms of the amount funded, which may be paid, in the Company s sole discretion, in one lump sum or in four (4) equal quarterly payments. If the Company does not make such quarterly payments timely for any quarter, then the Company shall pay the prorate Revenue Share amount, retroactive on the entire remaining balance owed, that would have been earned during such quarter until the default payments have been made and the payment schedule is no longer in default. 23 Table of Contents Funding Requirements Management has noted the existence of substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our existing cash will not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses through at least twelve months from the date of this filing. To continue to fund operations, we will need to secure additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings, through collaborations or partnerships with other companies or other sources. We may not be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Any failure to raise capital when needed could compromise our ability to execute on our business plan. If we are unable to raise additional funds, or if our anticipated operating results are not achieved, we believe planned expenditures may need to be reduced in order to extend the time period that existing resources can fund our operations. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital, it may have a material adverse effect on our operations and the development of our technology, or we may have to cease operations altogether. Our material cash requirements relate to the funding of our ongoing product development and for payment of significant levels of accounts payable and accrued executive and employee bonuses. The development of our product candidates is subject to numerous uncertainties, and we could use our cash resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of development is costly, and the timing of progress in pre-clinical tests and clinical trials is uncertain. Our ability to successfully transition to profitability will be dependent upon achieving further regulatory approvals and achieving a level of product sales adequate to support our cost structure. We cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities. Statement of Cash Flows Cash Flows from Operating Activities . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating activities used 3.4 million in cash, a decrease of cash used of approximately 1.7 million from the comparable prior year period when the Company used approximately 5.1 million for operating activities. After adjusting the comparison period s net income for non-cash expenses including equity-based compensation and amortization of lease liabilities, the Company incurred approximately 2.3 million less of additional cash net loss than in the comparable prior year period. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated about 600,000 less cash than the prior year period through net total changes in working capital accounts. Cash Flows from Investing Activities . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no investing activities. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our financing activities generated approximately 3.3 million, a decrease of approximately 1.5 million from the comparable prior year period when the Company generated approximately 4.8 million from financing activities. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received net proceeds of 3.2 million from direct sales of common equity to investors, and raised a net 100,000 from proceeds of a short term financing agreement. In the nine months ending September 30, 2023, the Company raised a net 100,000 from proceeds of a short term financing agreement, received 3.6 million in proceeds from the sale of equity, and received 1.0 million from a short term loan from the Company s CEO. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (3,407,788 (5,084,160 Investing activities - - Financing activities 3,292,811 4,769,540 Net increase (decrease) in Cash (114,977 (314,620 24 Table of Contents We estimate that we would require approximately 6.0 million in cash over the next 12 months in order to fund our basic operations, excluding our research and development initiatives. Based on this cash requirement, we have a near term need for additional funding to continue to develop our products and intellectual property. Historically, we have had substantial difficulty raising funds from external sources. If we are unable to raise the required capital, we will be forced to curtail our business operations, including our research and development activities. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results may differ materially from our estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in our financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate. For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, please read Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not applicable for smaller reporting companies. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer, as our principal executive officer, and the Chief Financial Officer, as our principal financial and accounting officer, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as the material weaknesses identified as of December 31, 2023 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and described below, continue to exist as of September 30, 2024. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 25 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not detect or prevent misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management utilized the criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. As previously reported, we identified material weaknesses that continued to exist at December 31, 2023. In addition, in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified additional material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, as described below. The material weakness has not been remediated as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has determined that the Company had the following material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting: Control Environment, Risk Assessment, and Monitoring As previously discussed in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023, management had concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023, due to: (i) lack of structure and responsibility, insufficient number of qualified resources, and inadequate oversight and accountability over the performance of controls, (ii) ineffective identification and assessment or risks impacting internal control over financial reporting, and (iii) ineffective evaluation and determination as to whether the components of internal control were present and functioning. Control Activities and Information and Communication These material weaknesses contributed to the following additional material weaknesses within certain business processes and the information technology environment: Management did not design and maintain appropriate information technology general controls in the areas of user access, vendor management controls, and segregation of duties, including controls over the recording and review of journal entries, related to certain information technology systems that support the Company s financial reporting process. Management did not design, implement, and retain appropriate documentation of formal accounting policies, procedures, and controls across substantially all of the company's business processes over; (i) the financial reporting process, including management review controls over key disclosures and financial statement support schedules, (ii) the monthly financial close process, including journal entries and account reconciliations and (iii) the completeness and accuracy of information used by control owners in the operation of certain controls, to achieve timely, complete, accurate financial accounting, reporting. 26 Table of Contents Management did not design and implement controls over the accounting, classification, and application of United States Generally Accounting Principles US GAAP relating to income taxes, stock-based compensation, and deferred research and development obligations - participation agreements accounting. Specifically: Management did not identify controls over the review of the tax provision, including the valuation analysis related to deferred tax assets, considerations for uncertain tax positions, the preparation of the income tax footnote and required disclosures and selecting and applying accounting policies; Management did not identify controls over the accounting and classification of deferred research and development obligations - participation agreements; and Management did not identify controls over the valuation of stock-based compensation for option awards to employees and members of the board of directors. Based on the assessment and identification of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective and could lead to a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures. Accordingly, management has concluded that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses. However, after giving full consideration to these material weaknesses, and the additional analyses and other procedures that we performed to ensure that our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods disclosed in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Remediation Plans Management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: Developing a training program and educating control owners concerning the principles of the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO; Implementing a risk assessment process by which management identifies risks of misstatement related to all account balances; Developing internal controls documentation, including comprehensive accounting policies and procedures over financial processes and related disclosures Enhancing policies and procedures to retain adequate documentary evidence for certain management review controls over certain business processes including precision of review and evidence of review procedures performed to demonstrate effective operation of such controls Engaging outside resources for complex accounting matters and drafting and retaining position papers for all complex, non-recurring transactions Developing monitoring activities and protocols that will allow us to timely assess the design and the operating effectiveness of controls over financial reporting and make necessary changes to the design of controls, if any; Segregating key functions within our financial and information technology processes supporting our internal controls over financial reporting; Reassessing and formalizing the design of certain accounting and information technology policies relating to security and change management controls, including user access reviews, including assessing the need for implementing a more robust information technology system and Continuing to enhance and formalize our accounting, business operations, and information technology policies, procedures, and controls to achieve complete, accurate, and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Except as discussed above, there was no other change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ending September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 27 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may be subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. To our knowledge, we are not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding. Item 1A.

We believe the offers, sales and issuances of the above securities were exempt from registration under the Securities Act by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act because the issuance of securities to the recipients did not involve a public offering. The recipients of the securities in each of these transactions represented their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates issued in these transactions. All recipients had adequate access, through their relationships with us, to information about Zivo. The sales of these securities were made without any general solicitation or advertising. The funds were used for general corporate purposes. Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities Not applicable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5.
