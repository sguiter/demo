on (the Company , Impact
BioMedical , We , IBO ), discovers, confirms, and patents unique science and technologies which
can be developed into new offerings in human healthcare and wellness in collaboration with external partners through licensing, co-development,
joint ventures, and other relationships. By leveraging technology and new science with strategic partnerships, we pursue advances
in biopharmaceuticals and over the counter direct to consumer wellness offerings. In addition to existing efforts, we continually
search for and evaluate other potential new offerings to add to our portfolio. Our business model includes partnering and potentially
direct sales for commercialization and distribution. Potential licensors and development partners include pharmaceutical, consumer goods
and services companies and others, who would commercialize IBO technologies in exchange for milestone, and royalty licensing payments. 

Impact
has several unique and proprietary technologies that are in continuing development: 

Linebacker 

Linebacker is a platform of
small molecule electrophilically enhanced polyphenol compounds with potential application in oncology (solid tumors), inflammatory disorders,
and neurology. Polyphenols are substances found in many nuts, vegetables, and berries. Linebacker compounds are modified Myricetin,
which is a common plant-derived flavonoid. Myricetin exhibits a wide range of activities that include strong antioxidants and anti-inflammatory
activities (source: NIH). Linebacker can potentially be developed as monotherapy or co-therapy to down-regulate PIM (proviral integration
site for Moloney murine leukemia virus) kinase which plays a key role as an oncogene in various cancers (e.g., colon, lung, prostate,
breast). Additional potential applications include inflammatory disorders and neurology. Linebacker-1 and Linebacker-2 compounds
have been licensed to ProPhase Laboratories (NASDAQ: PRPH) for development and potential commercialization worldwide, from which Impact
Biomedical could receive future milestone and royalty payments. Composition and method patents are issued to the company for Linebacker
in the U.S. and other countries. 

Laetose 

Laetose technology is derived
from a unique combination of multiple sugars independently with myo-inositol, which demonstrates compelling potential in 1) reducing glycemic
index and caloric intake in foods, 2) application as a therapeutic which inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- ), a cytokine
associated with inflammatory chronic diseases, and 3) a method of reducing or limiting the occurrence of diabetes. The sugar can
be one or a combination of sugars: sucrose, fructose, isoglucose, and galactose. Laetose has a unique composition patent allowed in the
United States and patents are pending in other countries worldwide. IBO is actively seeking potential partners for further development
and commercialization of Laetose as a consumer packaged or biopharmaceutical offering worldwide. 

Functional
Fragrance Formulation 3F 

3F is a suite of organic functional
fragrances containing specialized botanical ingredients (e.g., terpenes) with potential application as an antimicrobial, or as
an additive in insect repellents, detergents, lotions, shampoo, fabrics, and other substances to increase effectiveness. IBO has
partnered with the Chemia Corporation (St. Louis, MO) to pursue development of the 3F technology. Chemia is a leading developer and manufacturer
of fragrances and flavors. Composition patents have issued in the U.S. and are pending in other countries. In addition to Chemia,
IBO is actively seeking potential partners for the further development and commercialization of 3F worldwide, given the broad application
of this technology. 

Equivir /Equivir
G 

Equivir technology is a novel
blend of FDA Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) eligible polyphenols (e.g., Myricetin, Hesperetin, Piperine) which have demonstrated
antiviral effects with additional potential applications such as health supplements or medication. Polyphenols are substances found in
many nuts, vegetables, and berries. Myricetin is a member of the flavonoid class of polyphenolic compounds with antioxidant properties.
Hesperitin is a flavanone and Piperine is an alkaloid, commonly found in black pepper. Equivir/Equivir G is licensed to ProPhase
Laboratories for development and commercialization worldwide. ProPhase Lab s initial focus is for potential use as an over-the-counter
health supplement offering for upper respiratory wellness. Additional applications could be pursued in the future. Method and composition
patents are issued in the U.S. and other countries. 

Emerging
Technology 

IBO
continually evaluates additional technologies that are in various phases of development which can be advanced to patent filings and allowances.
These include, and are not limited to biopharmaceuticals, indoor air quality products, preservatives, bioplastics, personalized medicine
(e.g., genomics, diagnostics), nanotechnology, cannabis products and technology, pain management, and others. These activities
include discussions with inventors, scientists, universities, research foundations, and other parties, which, subject to completion
of diligence, and approval of the respective management, could potentially expand the offerings of IBO. 

As
of the date of this report, we have not generated significant revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in
our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including possible
delays in our research, testing and marketing efforts or wider economic downturns.

 Balance at September 30, 2024 

As
of September 30, 2023, management performed annual goodwill impairment testing. No goodwill impairment was identified as a result of
these tests. As of September 30, 2023, a quantitative analysis was prepared utilizing the Market Approach and Income Approach valuing
the Company. The guideline public company Market Approach produced a mean business enterprise value indication using estimated 2026 results
of million. The Income Approach was based upon the use of a discounted pro forma cash flow model and produced a business enterprise
value indication of million. A weighting of to the weighted value indicated was applied under the Market Approach, and a weighting
of to the value indicated under the Income Approach. A lower weighting was applied to the Market Approach due to the fact of using
forecasted earnings of the Company. Based upon the above weightings, an initial value of million for Impact was calculated. Adding
cash of to the initial business enterprise value produced a concluded business enterprise value of million (rounded) for
Impact. Subtracting interest-bearing debt of million, results in a Fair Value for the common equity of Impact of million.
As of September 30, 2023, the indicated equity value exceeded the carrying amount by approximately million or . No circumstances
or events have occurred since the most recent analysis that would indicate the need for an impairment.

We
considered various valuation methodologies in our analysis of the embedded derivative. Valuation methodologies can generally be aggregated
into the following three approaches: the Market Approach, the Income Approach, and the Cost Approach. Based on our analysis of the facts
and circumstances, in estimating the fair value of the Note payable, related party, we utilized a discounted cash flow method (income
approach), in the form of a Monte Carlo simulation of the Company s stock price and volume weighted average price VWAP throughout 36-month period from the Effective Date relative to its closing stock price and VWAP as of the Valuation Date, or and
 , respectively. The simulated analysis estimates the expected note cash flow from the date the first payment is due and until the
equity conversion rights expire under the terms of the Note payable, related party based on the following steps: 

1) Developed
 the Note Payable repayment schedule 
 
 2) Developed
 the following inputs underlying the simulation analysis 

i) Stock
 price 
 
 ii) VWAP 

3) Inputs
 (i) and (ii), were assigned a normal probability distribution, which has a mean of 0 and
 a standard deviation of 1, and a correlation of .9885 based on analysis of the guideline
 public companies 
 
 4) Ran
 a simulation with 25,000 trials for purposes of capturing the key inputs discussed above
 (i.e., forecasting the stock price and VWAP). 
 
 5) For
 the period from the 37th payment to maturity date, the DCF Method includes the remaining
 payments required to be made in cash.

Overview 

Impact
BioMedical, Inc. (the Company , Impact BioMedical , We through the utilization of its intellectual
property rights, or through investment in, or through acquisition of companies in the biohealth and biomedical fields, focuses on the
advancement of drug discovery and prevention, inhibition, and treatment of neurological, oncological, and immune related diseases. The
Company is also developing open-air defense initiatives, which curb transmission of air-borne infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis
and influenza. 

Global
BioLife, Inc. Global BioLife ), one of the Company s subsidiaries and the main operating company of the group, focuses
on research in four main areas: (i) the Linebacker project, which aims to develop a universal therapeutic drug platform;
(ii) a new sugar substitute called Laetose, (iii) a multi-use fragrance called 3F (Functional Fragrance
Formulation); and (iv) Equivir/Nemovir, a blend of natural polyphenols designed as an antimicrobial medication. 

Linebacker 

Unlike
the traditional approach to treat individual diseases with specific drugs, the Linebacker platform seeks to offer a breakthrough therapeutic
option for multiple diseases. Linebacker is designed to work by inhibiting a cascade of inflammatory responses responsible for many diseases.
Its design is in direct contrast to the traditional approach of targeting individual diseases with specific drugs. 

Laetose 

We
have also developed a low-calorie, low glycemic level, natural modified sugar through Global BioLife. The product, Laetose, 
is designed to possess low glycemic properties and mitigate inflammation. The Company is presently seeking to license Laetose. Global
BioLife established a joint venture, Sweet Sense, Inc. Sweet Sense ), with Quality Ingredients, LLC for the development,
manufacture, and global distribution of the new sugar substitute. On November 8, 2019, the Company purchased 50 of Sweet Sense Inc.
from Quality Ingredients, LLC for 91,000. Sweet Sense is now an 81.8 owned subsidiary of Impact BioMedical. 

Functional
Fragrance Formulation 3F 

Global
BioLife has entered into a royalty agreement with U.S.-based Chemia Corporation Chemia ), a leading developer and manufacturer
of fragrances, to manufacture the 3F technology. This arrangement, under the terms of the agreement, allows Chemia to create fragrances
based on Global BioLife s patents. The 3F product is made from specialized oils sourced from botanicals that insects avoid. Global
BioLife aims to commercialize this product, with any potential profits from the 3F project being split between Global BioLife and Chemia
pursuant to the terms of the 20-year Royalty Agreement. (Note 10)

respectively. The increase in net income (loss) is attributable to the Company s cost cutting measures in taken with both its
professional and research and development costs as the Company shifts efforts to taking to market its existing technologies as well
as the change in fair value of embedded derivatives associated with the amended Note payable, related party. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The
Company has historically met its liquidity and capital requirements primarily through debt financing. On September 16, 2024, the Company
completed an initial public offering raising 3,726,000 net of issuance costs and is currently listed on the NYSE American under the
ticker symbol IBIO. The Company s management intends to take additional actions necessary to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans concerning these matters include, among other things, monetization of its intellectual properties, and tightly controlling operating
costs. 

Cash
Flow from Continuing Operating Activities 

Net cash used by operating activities was 2,663,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cash used by operating activities of 2,418,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
This fluctuation is driven by less payments of the Company s accounts payable by approximately 232,000, as well as decrease in
net loss after reconciling items of approximately 161,000 

Cash
Flow from Investing Activities 

Net
cash provided by investing activities was 2,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cash used by investing
activities of 16,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This fluctuation is driven by the purchase of capital assets
approximating 18,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 without similar activities during 2024. 

Cash
Flow from Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 5,328,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and represents 1,602,000 in
borrowings from DSS as well as 3,726,000 in issuance of common stock, net of issuance costs. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was driven by borrowings from DSS of 2,633,000.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments,
assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. The financial
statements as of December 31, 2023, describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the
financial statements. Accounting for derivatives has been added to Footnote 2 of the accompanying financial statements. There are
no additional material changes to such critical accounting policies as of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
September 30, 2024. 

ITEM
4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e)
and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on this
evaluation and on the material weaknesses disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 which remained
as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is being recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms, and that our disclosure controls are not effectively designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is being accumulated and communicated to management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

While
changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as the Company
began implementation of the remediation steps described in our annual report dated December 31, 2023, we believe that there were no changes
in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
