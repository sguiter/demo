 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 (Dollar amounts referenced in this Item 2 are in thousands, except per share amounts.) 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto contained in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q and our audited financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to provide an understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those set forth under Item 1A Risk Factors, the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Form 10-Q, including the sections titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" and Risk Factors, contains forward-looking statements regarding our future performance. All forward-looking information is inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from assumptions, estimates or expectations reflected or contained in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There may be additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial which could have an adverse impact on our business. Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business, financial performance, financial condition and results of operations, and often contain words such as intends, estimates, anticipates, hopes, projects, plans, expects, drives, seek, believes, see, focus, should, will, would, opportunity, outlook, could, can, may, future, predicts, target, potential, "forecast," "trend," "might" and similar expressions and the negative versions of those words, and may be identified by the context in which they are used. However, the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements that address activities, events, circumstances or developments that AtriCure expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, such as earnings estimates (including projections and guidance), other predictions of financial performance, launches by AtriCure of new products, developments with competitors and market acceptance of AtriCure's products. Such statements are based largely upon current expectations of AtriCure. Reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to different materially from those expressed or implied. Forward-looking statements are based on AtriCure s expectations, experience and perception of current conditions, trends, expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond AtriCure s control. In other words, these statements are not guarantees of future performance and inherently involve a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. With respect to the forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new information or future events or otherwise unless required by law. 
 Overview 
 We are a leading innovator in treatments for atrial fibrillation (Afib), left atrial appendage (LAA) management and post-operative pain management. Our ablation and left atrial appendage management (LAAM) products are used by physicians during both open-heart and minimally invasive procedures. In open-heart procedures, the physician is performing heart surgery for other conditions and our products are used in conjunction with (or concomitant to) such a procedure. Minimally invasive procedures are performed on a standalone basis, and often include multi-disciplinary or hybrid approaches, combining surgical procedures using AtriCure ablation and LAAM products with catheter ablation procedures performed by electrophysiologists. Our pain management devices are used by physicians to freeze nerves during cardiothoracic or thoracic surgical procedures. We anticipate that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will relate to products we currently sell or are in the process of developing. 
 We sell our products to medical centers through our direct sales force in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Benelux region, Australia and Canada. We also sell our products through distributors who in turn sell our products to medical centers in other markets. Our business is primarily transacted in U.S. Dollars; direct sales transactions outside the United States are transacted in Euros, British Pounds, Australian Dollars or Canadian Dollars.

 Recent Developments 
 In 2024, we realized strong global revenue growth resulting from our continued strategic initiatives of product innovation, clinical science and physician education and training to expand awareness and adoption. Our worldwide revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 341,030, representing an increase of 48,328, or 16.5 , over the first nine months of 2023, driven by growing adoption across key product lines as well as new product launches. Historically there have been limited competitors in our key markets. However, new entrants are developing competing products, procedures, and/or clinical solutions that may cause variability in our results. 
 Highlights of the strategic and operational advancements include: 
 PRODUCT INNOVATION . We continue to invest in research and development of new products and pursue regulatory approvals to market and sell globally across all franchises. Throughout 2024, we received several additional CE Mark certifications under the European Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR). 
 Open . During the third quarter 2024, we received regulatory approval to sell the ENCOMPASS clamp in CE-marked countries in the European Union, representing a significant expansion of our open ablation franchise products in Europe. 
 Minimally invasive . In the first half of 2024, FDA granted 510(k) clearance for EPi-Ease , our Hybrid access device to facilitate guide-wire delivery, vacuum application and endoscope insertion. During the third quarter, FDA granted 510(k) clearance for our EnCapture clamp, the newest in our line of Isolator Synergy Ablation System clamps, with enhanced geometry and features to facilitate engagement with intended cardiac tissue. 
 Pain management . During the second quarter of 2024, we launched the cryoSPHERE + cryoablation probe for pain management in the US. The cryoSPHERE + device leverages new technology that minimizes thermal loss by focusing energy at the ball tip, allowing for a reduction in freeze time by 25 . Further, the cryoSPHERE MAX probe, recently launched in October 2024, features a larger ball tip designed to optimize Cryo Nerve Block therapy. This new probe reduces freeze times by 50 when compared to the first generation cryoSPHERE cryoablation probe, and over 30 when compared to the cryoSPHERE + probe. 
 Appendage management . The first patient was treated and we launched the AtriClip FLEX-Mini device in the US during the third quarter of 2024. The AtriClip FLEX-Mini sets a new standard as the smallest profile for surgical LAA device on the market and builds upon the proven technology of our AtriClip platform, with ease of use and design simplicity that offers enhanced access and increased visibility for physicians. We also obtained additional international regulatory approvals for our AtriClip platform during the third quarter. In China, we received approval to market and sell several models of our AtriClip Left Atrial Appendage Exclusion System from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China. In CE-marked countries in Europe, we received expanded indication for the AtriClip for use in patients at high risk of thromboembolism for whom left atrial appendage exclusion is warranted. 
 CLINICAL SCIENCE . We invest in studies to expand labeling claims, support various indications for our products and gather and publish clinical data for therapies and procedures involving our products. One of our critical initiatives is the Left Atrial Appendage Exclusion for Prophylactic Stroke Reduction (LeAAPS) IDE clinical trial. LeAAPS is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic LAA exclusion using the AtriClip LAA Exclusion System for the prevention of ischemic stroke or systemic arterial embolism in cardiac surgery patients without pre-operative AF diagnosis who are at risk for these events. This prospective, multicenter, randomized trial evaluates safety at 30 days post-procedure to demonstrate no increased risk with LAA exclusion during cardiac surgery, and efficacy over a minimum follow-up of five years post procedure. The trial provides for enrollment of up to 6,500 subjects at up to 250 sites worldwide. The first patient was enrolled in the trial in January 2023, and we ended the third quarter of 2024 with over 3,400 patients enrolled. Site initiation and enrollment is ongoing. 
 TRAINING . Our professional education team conducts a variety of in-person and virtual training programs for physicians and other healthcare professionals. These training methods ensure access to continuing education and awareness of our products and related procedures. During 2023, we launched new training courses for Advanced Practice Providers, pain management in pectus procedures, as well as a best practice course for developing arrhythmia programs, with a primary focus on Hybrid therapies. These training events allow for collaborative, hands-on engagement with our physician partners and other healthcare professionals. Additionally, our professional education courses continue to be enhanced by the use of simulation models or synthetic cadavers, known as CADets. These reusable CADets provide a sustainable alternative to the use of cadaver specimens, in addition to increasing the efficiencies of education and more cost effective training alternatives. In 2024, we continue to innovate physician training to improve accessibility and efficiency for our physician partners. We are currently piloting the use of live streaming to enable remote proctoring and case observation.

 Results of Operations 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts and as percentages of revenue: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Amount of Revenues Amount of Revenues Revenue 115,910 100.0 98,290 100.0 Cost of revenue 29,117 25.1 24,421 24.8 Gross profit 86,793 74.9 73,869 75.2 Operating expenses: Research and development expenses 20,960 18.1 20,354 20.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 73,238 63.2 61,604 62.7 Total operating expenses 94,198 81.3 81,958 83.4 Loss from operations (7,405) (6.4) (8,089) (8.2) Other expense, net: (126) (0.1) (919) (0.9) Loss before income tax expense (7,531) (6.5) (9,008) (9.2) Income tax expense 322 0.3 47 Net loss (7,853) (6.8) (9,055) (9.2) 
 Revenue. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our revenue by product type and geography expressed as dollar amounts and the corresponding change in such revenues between periods, in both dollars and percentages: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Open ablation 30,601 25,844 4,757 18.4 Minimally invasive ablation 11,117 10,893 224 2.1 Pain management 16,314 12,591 3,723 29.6 Appendage management 37,420 32,364 5,056 15.6 Total United States 95,452 81,692 13,760 16.8 Total International 20,458 16,598 3,860 23.3 Total revenue 115,910 98,290 17,620 17.9 
 Worldwide revenue increased 17.9 (17.8 on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales grew in key product lines, including our ENCOMPASS clamp in open ablation, AtriClip Flex V for appendage management and our cryoSPHERE probes for post-operative pain management. Growth in minimally invasive ablation was driven by our EPi-Sense System devices for Hybrid AF Therapy. International sales increased 23.3 (22.4 on a constant currency basis), with strength across all franchises in Europe and most of our other major markets. 
 Revenue reported on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure calculated by applying previous period foreign currency exchange rates, which are determined by the average daily exchange rate, to each of the comparable periods. Revenue is analyzed on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on revenue, we believe that evaluating growth in revenue on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of revenue to both management and investors. 
 Cost of revenue and gross margin. Cost of revenue increased 4,696 primarily reflecting higher sales volumes. Gross margin decreased 27 basis points, driven primarily by less favorable geographic and product mix.

Table of Contents 

 Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased 606 or 3.0 . Expansion of product development, clinical and regulatory teams resulted in 1,815 increase in personnel costs including travel and share-based compensation. Clinical trial expenses increased 739 from increased clinical activity and consulting costs, driven by LeAAPS clinical trial patient enrollment and follow up activities. These increases were partially offset by a 2,179 decrease in product development project spend and regulatory filings and submission costs incurred in 2023 related to several products brought to market in 2024, including cryoSPHERE+ and AtriClip FLEX-Mini. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11,634, or 18.9 , driven by 9,337 increase in personnel costs including travel and share-based compensation, primarily reflecting headcount growth and variable compensation. Consulting fees increased 1,274, while marketing and meeting costs increased 725. Professional services, IT and other corporate costs grew 444, offset by a 401 decrease in training costs. 
 Other income (expense). Other income and expense consists primarily of net interest expense and net foreign currency transaction gains or losses.

 management and AtriClip Flex V for appendage management in open-chest procedures. International sales increased 24.8 (24.6 on a constant currency basis), across all franchises and major geographic regions. 
 Cost of revenue and gross margin. Cost of revenue increased 13,978, reflecting higher sales volumes, while gross margin decreased 61 basis points, primarily driven by less favorable geographic and product mix, as well as an increase in product costs. 
 Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased 8,102 or 15.3 , primarily from a 5,305 increase in personnel costs as a result of additional headcount in our product development, regulatory, and clinical teams. Clinical trial expenses increased 3,448 due to increased clinical activity primarily driven by the LeAAPS trial. These were partially offset by a 574 decrease due to higher regulatory approval costs in 2023. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 33,723, or 18.2 , due to a 22,763 increase in personnel costs, including travel and share-based compensation, as a result of growth in headcount and variable compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased 1,877 for professional services, IT and corporate costs reflecting operational growth, a 1,892 increase in marketing, training and meeting activities and an increase of 901 in consulting fees. The increase was further driven by a 4,412 non-recurring net gain during 2023 related to legal settlements; see Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies for related discussion. 
 Other income (expense). During the first quarter of 2024, the Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 1,362; see Note 7 - Indebtedness for related discussion. The remaining activity consists primarily of net interest expense and net foreign currency transaction gains or losses. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of 130,335 and outstanding debt of 61,865. We had unused borrowing capacity of 61,885 (see Note 7 - Indebtedness for related discussion). All cash equivalents and investments and most of our operating cash are held in United States financial institutions. A small portion of our cash is held in foreign banks to support our international operations. We had net working capital of 194,855 and an accumulated deficit of 386,187 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Consolidated Cash Flows - For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 5,914 from 2023 to 2024. Operating results declined 8,481, primarily due to a 4,412 nonrecurring net gain for legal settlements recorded in 2023. In addition, non-cash charges increased 7,633 in 2024. Cash used for working capital and other assets and liabilities decreased 6,762 due to collection of accounts receivable and moderating investments in inventory in 2024, partially offset by higher annual variable compensation payments due to improved operating performance. 
 Cash flows provided by investing activities. Net cash provided by investing activities increased by 20,324 in 2024 compared to 2023, due to the cash paid for acquisition of intellectual property in the prior year of 30,000, offset by a 10,147 decrease in sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities.

 Cash flows used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities increased by 2,950 in 2024. This increase was a result of a 1,623 payment for extinguishment of debt and financing fees, net of borrowings, and a 998 decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan. 
 Credit facility. As of January 5, 2024, we entered into a credit agreement (Credit Agreement) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Silicon Valley Bank, a division of First-Citizens Bank and Trust Company, as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners that provides for a 125,000 asset-based revolving credit facility (ABL Facility), with an option to increase the revolving commitment by an additional 40,000. A portion of the ABL Facility, limited to 5,000, is available for the issuance of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement has a three-year term and expires January 5, 2027. Amounts available to be drawn from time to time under the ABL Facility are determined by calculating the applicable borrowing base, which is based upon applicable percentages of the values of eligible accounts receivable, eligible inventory, eligible liquid assets, less reserves as determined by the Administrative Agent, all as specified in the Credit Agreement. The borrowings bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company's election: (i) an alternate base rate (ABR) plus an applicable margin or (ii) an adjusted term secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus an applicable margin. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has borrowed 61,865, classified as noncurrent and had unused borrowing availability of 61,885. 
 Our corporate headquarters lease agreement requires a 1,250 letter of credit which we renew annually and remains outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 For additional information on the terms and conditions, as well as applicable interest and fee payments, see Note 7 Indebtedness. 
 Uses of liquidity and capital resources. Our executive officers and Board of Directors review our funding sources and future capital requirements in connection with our annual operating plan and periodic updates to the plan. Our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation: market acceptance of our current and future products; costs to develop and support our products, including professional training; costs to expand and support our sales and marketing efforts; operating and filing costs relating to changes in regulatory policies or laws; costs for clinical trials and to secure regulatory approval for new products; costs to prosecute, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights; maintenance and enhancements to our information systems and security; and possible acquisitions and joint ventures, including potential business integration costs. We continue to evaluate additional measures to maintain financial flexibility, and we will continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions including, but not limited to, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates that may impact our liquidity and access to capital resources. Our principal cash requirements include costs of operations, capital expenditures, debt service costs and other contractual obligations. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns and allowances, inventories, share-based compensation and income taxes. We use authoritative pronouncements, historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 includes additional information about the Company, our operations, our financial position and our critical accounting policies and estimates and should be read in conjunction with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the information provided regarding recent accounting pronouncements in Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management, with the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer (the Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (the Principal Accounting and Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13(a) -15(e) and 15(d) -15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, we concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s forms and rules, and the material information relating to the Company is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that control objectives are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company will be detected. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individuals, by collusion of two or more people or by management override. Over time, controls can become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance may deteriorate. Further, the design of any system of controls is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in any cost-effective control system, misstatements due to errors or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 In the ordinary course of business, we routinely enhance our information systems by either upgrading current systems or implementing new ones. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Information with respect to legal proceedings can be found under the heading Legal in Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, careful consideration should be given to the factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described therein are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. There have been no material changes with respect to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our executive officers or directors or modified a "Rule 10b5-1(c) trading arrangement" or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
