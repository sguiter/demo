stores in states and the District of Columbia, with an average size of approximately square feet. The Company has distribution centers located in Michigan, Oklahoma, Virginia and Wisconsin. , . SEC Developments Relating to Climate Change Disclosures On March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to require public companies (including the Company) to provide detailed climate-related information in their registration statements and periodic reports. Among other things, the final rules require public companies to disclose information about (i) climate-related risks that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on the company s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition; (ii) the actual and potential material impacts of such risks on the company s strategy, business model, and outlook; (iii) a company s activities, if any, to mitigate or adapt to material climate-related risks; (iv) the role of the board of directors in overseeing climate-related risks and management s role in assessing and managing the company s material climate-related risks; (v) processes the company uses for identifying, assessing, and managing material climate-related risks; (vi) the company s Scope 1 Greenhouse Gas GHG emissions (direct GHG emissions) and Scope 2 GHG emissions (indirect GHG emissions resulting from purchased energy) when such emissions are material and an attestation report covering such disclosures; and (vii) expenditures, costs, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions (subject to disclosure thresholds) to be disclosed in notes to the financial statements. Based on the rule as adopted, compliance with these requirements will be phased in over a period of years, with disclosure by large accelerated filers starting in 2026 with respect to information for the 2025 fiscal year and disclosure by smaller reporting companies (such as the Company at this time) starting in 2028 with respect to information for the 2027 fiscal year, if not delayed by the SEC. Certain requirements such as GHG emissions do not apply to smaller reporting companies (such as the Company at this time). Various organizations have filed lawsuits seeking to invalidate the SEC s final rules that mandate climate-related disclosures. These lawsuits, which challenge the authority of the SEC to adopt these rules, have been consolidated in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On April 4, 2024, the SEC issued an order staying its final climate disclosure rules pending the completion of judicial review of these lawsuits. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the rules on its disclosures and will monitor the litigation progress for possible impacts on the disclosure requirements under the rules.

 (1) Man-made tile revenues include sales of luxury vinyl tile products. The Company generates revenues by selling tile products, setting and maintenance materials, accessories, and delivery services to its customers through its store locations and online. The timing of revenue recognition coincides with the transfer of control of goods and services ordered by the customer, which falls into one of three categories described below: Revenue recognized when an order is placed If a customer places an order in a store and the contents of their order are available, the Company recognizes revenue concurrent with the exchange of goods for consideration from the customer. Revenue recognized when an order is picked up If a customer places an order for items held in a centralized distribution center, the Company requests a deposit from the customer at the time they place the order. Subsequently, when the contents of the customer s order are delivered to the store, the customer returns to the store and picks up the items that were ordered. The Company recognizes revenue on this transaction when the customer picks up their order. Revenue recognized when an order is delivered If a customer places an order in a store and requests delivery of their order, the Company prepares the contents of their order, initiates the delivery service, and recognizes revenue once the contents of the customer s order are delivered. The Company determines the transaction price of its contracts based on the pricing established at the time a customer places an order. The transaction price does not include sales tax as the Company is a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales tax. Any discounts applied to an order are allocated proportionately to the base price of the goods and services ordered. Deposits made by customers are recorded in other accrued liabilities. Deferred revenues associated with customer deposits are recognized at the time the Company transfers control of the items ordered or renders the delivery service. In the event an order is partially fulfilled at the end of a reporting period, revenue will be recognized based on the transaction price allocated to the goods delivered and services rendered. The customer deposit balance was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Revenues recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that were included in the customer deposit balance as of the beginning of the period were million. The Company extends financing to qualified professional customers who apply for credit. Customers who qualify for an account receive 30-day payment terms. The accounts receivable balance was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company expects that the customer will pay for the goods and services ordered within one year from the date the order is placed. Accordingly, the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the financing component.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument. There have been no changes in the valuation techniques used by the Company to value the Company s financial instruments. Cash and cash equivalents: Consists of cash on hand, bank deposits and money market funds primarily held in short term US treasury securities. The value was measured using quoted market prices in active markets. The carrying amount approximates fair value. Fair value measurements also apply to certain non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Property, plant and equipment and right of use assets are measured at fair value when an impairment is recognized and the related assets are written down to fair value. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did t record any impairment charges in selling, general and administrative expenses to write-down property, plant and equipment and right of use assets to their estimated fair values. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded million and million, respectively, of impairment charges. The Company measured the fair value of these assets based on projected cash flows, an estimated risk-adjusted rate of return and market rental rates for comparable properties.

Shares tendered or withheld to pay the exercise price of a stock option or to cover tax withholding will not be added back to the number of shares available under the 2021 Plan. To the extent that any award under the 2021 Plan, or any award granted under the Prior Plan prior to stockholder approval of the 2021 Plan, is forfeited, canceled, surrendered or otherwise terminated without the issuance of shares or an award is settled only in cash, the shares subject to such awards granted but not delivered will be added to the number of shares available for awards under the 2021 Plan. Stock options: The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock based awards at fair value. The financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include compensation expense for the portion of outstanding awards that vested during those periods. The Company recognizes stock based compensation expenses on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term.

Recipients are not required to provide any consideration upon vesting of the award. Restricted stock awards are subject to certain restrictions on transfer, and all or part of the shares awarded may be subject to forfeiture upon the occurrence of certain events, including employment termination.

Overview and Recent Trends We are a specialty retailer of man-made and natural stone tiles, luxury vinyl tiles, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories in the United States. We offer a wide selection of high-quality products, exclusive designs, knowledgeable staff and exceptional customer service, in an extensive showroom environment with up to 50 full-room tiled displays. As of September 30, 2024, we operated 142 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia, with an average size of approximately 20,000 square feet. We purchase our tile products and accessories directly from suppliers and manufacture our own setting and maintenance materials, such as thinset, grout, and sealers. We believe that our long-term supplier relationships, together with our design and manufacturing and distribution capabilities, enable us to offer a broad assortment of high-quality products to our customers, who are primarily homeowners and professionals, at competitive prices. We have invested significant resources to develop our proprietary brands and product sources, and we believe that we are a leading retailer of man-made and natural stone, luxury vinyl tiles, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories in the United States. Our business continues to be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including high interest rates, and slowing existing home turnover. We believe this is contributing to a slowdown in demand for home improvement products. Our comparable store sales decreased by 7.9 and 8.4 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to lower levels of traffic in our stores. While our net sales declined in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, our gross margin rate improved by 180 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 to 66.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The improvement in gross margin rate was primarily due to decreases in product costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.7 million, or 1.2 , from 56.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 56.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in variable compensation costs totaling 0.7 million, advertising expense of 0.6 million and depreciation expense of 0.6 million. These factors were partially offset by a 0.5 million increase in occupancy costs, a 0.2 million increase in information technology expenses and a 0.2 million increase in shipping and transportation costs.

In response to the challenges faced in our industry and continued pressure on our topline results, we took steps to close our distribution center located in Dayton, New Jersey, reduce staffing levels at our corporate office and close our trading company office located in Beijing, China. We did not incur any material asset impairment or severance costs in connection with these actions. We are actively working to sublease the distribution center space in Dayton, New Jersey. Our lease of the distribution space in Dayton, New Jersey expires in September 2026. We anticipate the annualized benefit from these actions will reduce SG A expenses by 2.8 million to 4.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 28.5 million of operating cash flow, which was used to fund 11.8 million of capital expenditures. Cash and cash equivalents increased by 16.4 million from 8.6 million on December 31, 2023 to 25.1 million on September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding on our line of credit. Key Components of our Consolidated Statements of Income Net Sales Net sales represents total charges to customers, net of returns, and includes freight charged to customers. We recognize sales at the time that the customer takes control of the merchandise or final delivery of the product has occurred. We are required to charge and collect sales and other taxes on sales to our customers and remit these taxes back to government authorities. Total revenues do not include sales tax because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales tax. Sales are reduced by a reserve for anticipated sales returns that we estimate based on historical returns. Comparable store sales growth is the percentage change in sales of comparable stores period-over-period. A store is considered comparable on the first day of the 13th full month of operation. When a store is relocated, it is excluded from the comparable store sales growth calculation. Comparable store sales growth amounts include total charges to customers less any actual returns. We include the change in allowance for anticipated sales returns applicable to comparable stores in the comparable store sales calculation. Comparable store sales data reported by other companies may be prepared on a different basis and therefore may not be useful for purposes of comparing our results to those of other businesses. Company management believes the comparable store sales growth (decline) metric provides useful information to both management and investors to evaluate the Company s performance, the effectiveness of its strategy and its competitive position. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists primarily of material costs, freight, customs and duties fees, and storage and delivery of product to the customers, as well as physical inventory losses and costs associated with manufacturing of setting and maintenance materials. Gross Profit Gross profit is net sales less cost of sales. Gross margin rate is the percentage determined by dividing gross profit by net sales. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs, occupancy, utilities, maintenance costs, advertising costs, shipping and transportation expenses to move inventory from our distribution centers to our stores, and depreciation and amortization. Income Taxes We are subject to income tax in the United States as well as other tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business.

Gross Profit Gross profit decreased 3.3 million, or 5.6 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The gross margin rate was 66.5 and 64.7 during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The improvement in gross margin rate was primarily due to decreases in product costs. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 0.7 million, or 1.2 , from 56.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 56.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in variable compensation costs totaling 0.7 million, advertising expense of 0.6 million and depreciation expense of 0.6 million. These factors were partially offset by a 0.5 million increase in occupancy costs, a 0.2 million increase in information technology expenses and a 0.2 million increase in shipping and transportation costs. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 0.1 million and 0.5 million, respectively. The decrease in the provision for income tax was due to a decrease in pretax income. Our effective tax rate was 77.0 and 22.4 in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was largely due to a decrease in pretax income and a disproportionate impact of certain permanent items.

Sales decreased at comparable stores by 8.4 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in store traffic. Gross Profit Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 11.5 million, or 6.1 , compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gross margin rate was 66.1 and 64.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the gross margin rate was primarily due to decreases in product costs and stabilizing international freight costs. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1.2 million, or 0.7 , compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to reductions of depreciation expense of 2.6 million and variable compensation costs totaling 2.5 million, partially offset by an increase in occupancy expenses totaling 2.6 million due to an increase in rent expense associated with leases that were extended over the last year, a 0.9 million increase in information technology expenses and a 0.8 million increase in shipping and transportation costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 0.9 million of asset impairment charges in connection with the write-down of certain store assets. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes decreased 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease in taxable income. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 27.9 and 26.1 , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was largely due to a decrease in pretax income and a disproportionate impact of certain permanent items . Non-GAAP Measures We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by taking net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ), and adjusting for interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin is equal to Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. We calculate pretax return on capital employed by taking income from operations divided by capital employed. Capital employed equals total assets less accounts payable, income taxes payable, other accrued liabilities, lease liability and other long-term liabilities. Other companies may calculate 

 18 
 Table of Contents 

both Adjusted EBITDA and pretax return on capital employed differently, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, for purposes of determining management incentive compensation, for budgeting and planning purposes and for assessing the effectiveness of capital allocation over time. These measures are used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and our Board of Directors. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other specialty retailers, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Our management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 of sales 2023 of sales Net income 41 0.0 1,844 2.0 Interest expense 71 0.1 453 0.5 Provision for income taxes 138 0.2 532 0.6 Depreciation and amortization 4,458 5.3 5,062 5.5 Stock based compensation 336 0.4 366 0.4 Adjusted EBITDA 5,044 6.0 8,257 9.0

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity requirements have been for working capital and capital expenditures. Our principal sources of liquidity are 25.1 million of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, our cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under our Credit Agreement. We expect to use this liquidity for maintaining our existing stores, purchasing additional merchandise inventory, and general corporate purposes. On September 30, 2022, Holdings and its operating subsidiary, The Tile Shop, LLC and certain subsidiaries of each entered into a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the lenders party thereto, including Fifth Third Bank (the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides us with a senior credit facility consisting of a 75.0 million revolving line of credit through September 30, 2027. Borrowings pursuant to the Credit Agreement initially bear interest at a rate per annum equal to: (i) Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin ranging from 1.25 to 1.75 ; (ii) Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin ranging from 1.25 to 1.75 ; or (iii) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin ranging from 0.25 to 0.75 . The margin is determined based on the Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement is secured by virtually all our assets, including but not limited to inventory, accounts receivable, equipment and general intangibles. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, conditions to borrowing and restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets, engage in acquisitions or mergers, make distributions on or repurchases of capital stock, incur additional debt, incur liens or make investments. The Credit Agreement also includes financial and other covenants, including covenants to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of no less than 1.20 to 1.00 and a Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of no greater than 3.50 to 1.00. We were in compliance with the covenants as of September 30, 2024. We had no borrowings outstanding on our line of credit as of September 30, 2024. We have standby letters of credit outstanding related to our workers compensation and medical insurance policies. As of September 30, 2024, standby letters of credit totaled 1.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, there was 73.8 million available for borrowing on the revolving line of credit, which may be used for maintaining our existing stores, purchasing additional merchandise inventory, and general corporate purposes. We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under our Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures over at least the next twelve months and our long-term liquidity requirements. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were 11.8 million and 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2024 were primarily due to investments in store remodels, merchandising, distribution and information technology assets.

Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flow data for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. (in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 28,511 56,172 Net cash used in investing activities (11,661) (10,988) Net cash used in financing activities (481) (35,887) 
 Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 28.5 million compared with 56.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income, an income tax refund received in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, that did not recur in 2024, and other working capital changes. Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled 11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to investments in store remodels, merchandising, distribution and information technology assets. Financing activities Net cash used in financing activities was 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 35.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash outflows for financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily related to payments made against our line of credit. We were able to fully repay our line of credit in 2023. Cash and cash equivalents totaled 25.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared with 8.6 million at December 31, 2023. Working capital was 42.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared with 35.8 million at December 31, 2023. ITE M 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that information relating to the Company is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 and have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, the application of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As previously disclosed, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness due to the ineffective design of the Company s information technology general controls ITGCs ), which stemmed from deficiencies in user access controls, which did not adequately restrict access to the Company s financial reporting system, did not ensure appropriate segregation of duties, and 

 21 
 Table of Contents 

did not prevent unauthorized individuals from having the ability to create, post and modify journal entries. The material weakness also resulted in the ineffectiveness of automated and manual business process controls throughout the Company s financial reporting and business transaction cycles that are dependent upon the affected ITGCs. While we are working to implement controls and procedures to remediate the ITGC deficiencies, such deficiencies continue to result in an elevated risk that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected by other compensating controls. Notwithstanding the ITGC-related material weakness, we believe the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. Planned Remediation of Material Weakness Management has actively engaged in implementing remediation plans to address the remaining material weakness in its ITGCs outlined above. The steps taken to remediate the ITGC material weakness during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included: Restricting access in our enterprise resource planning ERP system to process transactions that could trigger a manual journal entry initiated outside of the park and post process for users who are responsible for reviewing account reconciliations. Implementing a new monitoring control to identify the population of transactions processed in our ERP system that generate accounting entries that do not go through the park and post process and assessing the compensating controls designed to reduce the risk of misstatement arising from these transactions to an appropriate level. Adjusting access profiles in the Company s ERP system to eliminate the ability for a user to modify and subsequently approve a manual journal entry. Reviewing activity occurring during the quarter to identify and assess the appropriateness of any manual journal entries that had been modified and approved by the same user. Refining the ruleset applied to identify segregation of duty and sensitive access risks. Evaluating identified segregation of duties and sensitive access risks and adjusting access profiles to mitigate segregation of duty and sensitive access risks. Mapping identified segregation of duty and sensitive access risks to compensating controls that exist within the control environment. We continue to implement the remediation steps with respect to the ITGC-related material weakness outlined above. The identified material weakness in internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls have been in operation for a sufficient period of time for our management to conclude that such material weakness has been remediated. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our remediation efforts in connection with our evaluations of internal control over financial reporting. No assurance can be made that our remediation efforts will be completed in a timely manner or that the updated controls and procedures associated with such efforts will be deemed adequate after being subjected to testing. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Other than the changes discussed above, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined by Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, intends that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of 

 22 
 Table of Contents 

changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION IT EM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are, from time to time, party to lawsuits, threatened lawsuits, disputes and other claims arising in the normal course of business. We assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. Where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal accruals may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, we do not record an accrual, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. In the opinion of management, while the outcome of such claims and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, our ultimate liability in connection with these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, and the amounts accrued for any individual matter are not material. However, legal proceedings are inherently uncertain. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period. IT EM 1A. RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. ITE M 2.
