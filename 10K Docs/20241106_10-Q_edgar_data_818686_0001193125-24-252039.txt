million, of which million related to 2022 and million related to 2023. These errors resulted from the exclusion of royalty payments that should have been included in the fair value re-measurement
 calculation of the contingent consideration liability as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the quarterly and year-to-date

 periods ended June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2022, and March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2023. These errors did not impact the Company s actual royalty payments, as well as total cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities in the periods stated above. 
 The Company evaluated the errors, individually and in the aggregate, considering both qualitative and quantitative factors, and concluded that these errors did not have a material impact on any of the prior periods stated above. However, the aggregate amount of the prior period errors in 2022, would have been material to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2023. Therefore, the Company has revised the prior periods impacted for these errors.

(1) 
 Cumulative goodwill impairment as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately billion and billion, respectively. 
 Teva operates its business through three reporting segments: United States, Europe and International Markets. Each of these business segments is a reporting unit. Additional reporting units include Teva s production and sale of APIs to third parties Teva API and an out-licensing
 platform offering a portfolio of products to other pharmaceutical companies through its affiliate Medis. Teva s API and Medis reporting units are included under Other in the table above. See note 15 for additional segment information. 
 Teva determines the fair value of its reporting units using the income approach. The income approach is a forward-looking approach for estimating fair value. Within the income approach, the method used is the discounted cash flow method. Teva begins with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminal value, and then applies a discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Cash flow projections are based on Teva s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used is based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC ), adjusted for the relevant risk associated with country-specific and business-specific characteristics. If any of these expectations were to vary materially from Teva s assumptions, Teva may record an impairment of goodwill allocated to these reporting units in the future. 
 First Quarter Developments 

 As further discussed in note 15, as of January 1, 2024, Canada is reported as part of Teva s International Markets segment and not as part of Teva s North America segment, which has been renamed as Teva s United States segment. As a result, Teva aligned its segment reporting and its reporting units in accordance with this change, and reallocated its goodwill to the adjusted reporting units using a relative fair value allocation. In conjunction with the goodwill reallocation, Teva performed a goodwill impairment test for the balances in its adjusted United States and International Markets reporting units and concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, management evaluated whether there were any developments that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of any of its reporting units was below its carrying amount as of March 31, 2024. Management concluded that no triggering event had occurred and, therefore, no quantitative assessment was performed. 
 Second Quarter Developments 

 During the second quarter of 2024, Teva completed its long-range planning LRP process. The LRP is part of Teva s internal financial planning and budgeting processes and is discussed and reviewed by Teva s management and its board of directors. 

million related to Teva s API reporting unit. 
 Following the goodwill impairment charges recorded in relation to Teva s API reporting unit, the carrying values of this reporting unit equaled its fair value as of June 30, 2024. Therefore, if business conditions or expectations were to change materially, it may be necessary to record further impairment charges to Teva s API reporting unit in the future (see Third Quarter Developments below). 

Teva s United States, Europe, International Markets and Medis reporting units had fair values in excess of over their book values as of June 30, 2024. 
 In the second quarter of 2023, Teva recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to its International Markets reporting unit, mainly due to an increase in the discount rate due to higher risk associated with country-specific characteristics of several countries. 
 Third Quarter Developments 

 During the third quarter of 2024, management evaluated whether there were any developments that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of any of its reporting units was below its carrying amount as of September 30, 2024. 
 As part of this evaluation, management noted a triggering event related to Teva s API reporting unit, which resulted from updated assumptions in connection with Teva s intention to divest its API business through a sale. 
 Teva performed a quantitative assessment in the third quarter of 2024, which resulted in the recording of a goodwill impairment charge of million related to Teva s API reporting unit. 
 Following this goodwill impairment charge, the carrying value of Teva s API reporting unit equaled its fair value as of September 30, 2024. Therefore, if business conditions or expectations, including related to Teva s intention to divest its API business, were to change materially, it may be necessary to record further impairment charges to Teva s API reporting unit in the future. 
 With respect to the remaining reporting units, management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any of the reporting units was below its carrying amounts as of September 30, 2024 and, therefore, no quantitative assessment was performed.

 Long-term debt was issued by several indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company and is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company as to payment of all principal, interest, discount and additional amounts, if any. The long-term debt outlined in the above table is generally redeemable at any time at varying redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest. 

Teva s debt as of September 30, 2024 was effectively denominated in the following currencies: in U.S. dollars, in euro and in Swiss franc. 
 Teva s principal sources of short-term liquidity are its cash on hand, existing cash investments, liquid securities and available credit facilities, primarily its billion unsecured syndicated sustainability-linked revolving credit facility entered into in April 2022, as amended on February 6, 2023 and on May 3, 2024 RCF ). 
 The RCF had an initial maturity date of April 2026
 with two 
 extension options. In April 2024, an extension option was exercised and the RCF maturity date was extended to April 2027. The RCF contains certain covenants, including certain limitations on incurring liens and indebtedness and maintenance of certain financial ratios, including a maximum leverage ratio, which becomes more restrictive over time. 
 On May 3, 2024, the terms of the RCF were amended to update the Company s maximum permitted leverage ratio under the RCF for certain periods. Under the terms of the RCF, as amended, the Company s leverage ratio shall not exceed (i) x in 2024, 2025 and in the first quarter of 2026, (ii) x in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2026 and (iii) x in the first quarter of 2027 and onwards. The RCF permits the Company to increase the maximum leverage ratio if it consummates or commences certain material transactions. 
 Under the RCF, as amended, the applicable margin used to calculate the interest rate under the RCF is linked to one sustainability performance target, the number of new regulatory submissions in low and middle-income countries. 
 Under specified circumstances, including non-compliance
 with any of the covenants described above and the unavailability of any waiver, amendment or other modification thereto, the Company will not be able to borrow under the RCF. Additionally, violations of the covenants, under the circumstances referred to above, would result in an event of default in all borrowings under the RCF and, when greater than a specified threshold amount as set forth in each series of senior notes and sustainability-linked senior notes is outstanding, could lead to an event of default under the Company s senior notes and sustainability-linked senior notes due to cross-acceleration provisions. 
 Teva expects that it will continue to have sufficient cash resources to support its debt service payments and all other financial obligations within one year from the date that the financial statements are issued. 
 of Teva s revenues were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, Teva is subject to significant foreign currency risks. 
 The Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases and writes options in order to hedge the currency exposure on balance sheet items, revenues and expenses. In addition, the Company takes measures to reduce its exposure by using natural hedging. The Company also acts to offset risks in opposite directions among the subsidiaries within Teva. The currency hedged items are usually denominated in the following main currencies: euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, British pound, Russian ruble, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, new Israeli shekel, Indian rupee and other currencies. Depending on market conditions, foreign currency risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. 
 The Company may choose to hedge against possible fluctuations in foreign subsidiaries net assets net investment hedge and has in the past entered into cross-currency swaps and forward-contracts in order to hedge such an exposure. 
 Most of the counterparties to the derivatives are major banks and the Company is monitoring the associated inherent credit risks. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.

 Teva uses foreign exchange contracts (mainly option and forward contracts) to hedge balance sheet items from currency exposure. These foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. In connection with these foreign exchange contracts, Teva recognizes gains or losses that offset the revaluation of the balance sheet items also recorded under financial expenses, net. 

(3) 
 Teva entered into option and forward contracts designed to limit the exposure of foreign exchange fluctuations on projected revenues and expenses recorded in euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, British pound, Russian ruble, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty and some other currencies to protect its projected operating results for 2024. These derivative instruments do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, however, they are accounted for as an economic hedge. These derivative instruments, which may include hedging transactions against future projected revenues and expenses, are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value on a quarterly basis, while the foreign exchange impact on the underlying revenues and expenses may occur in subsequent quarters. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the negative impact from these derivatives recognized under revenues was million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the positive impact from these derivatives recognized under revenues
 was million. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, the positive impact from these derivatives recognized under revenues
 was million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the positive impact from these derivatives recognized under revenues was million. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in the same line item in the statements of income as the underlying exposure being hedged. Cash flows associated with these derivatives are reflected as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Amortizations due to terminated derivative instruments: 

 Forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury lock agreements 

 In 2015, Teva entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury lock agreements to protect the Company from interest rate fluctuations in connection with a future debt issuance the Company was planning. These forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury lock agreements were terminated in July 2016 upon the debt issuance. Termination of these transactions resulted in a loss position of million, which was recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) and is amortized under financial expenses, net over the life of the debt. 
 With respect to these forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury lock agreements, losses of million were recognized under financial expenses, net, for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and losses of million and million were recognized under financial expenses, net for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Supplier Finance Program Obligation 

 Teva maintains supply chain finance agreements with participating financial institutions. Under these agreements, participating suppliers may voluntarily elect to sell their accounts receivable with Teva to these financial institutions. Teva s suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective financial institutions and Teva is not a party to these agreements. Teva has no economic interest in its suppliers decisions to participate in the program and Teva pays the financial institutions the stated amount of confirmed invoices on the maturity dates, which is generally within 120 days from the date the invoice was received. The agreements with the financial institutions do not require Teva to provide assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees for the supplier finance program. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the supplier finance program are recorded under accounts payables 
in Teva s consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, million and million of accounts payables to suppliers participating

Expenses in the third quarter of 2023 were mainly related to an update to the provision for the DOJ patient assistance program litigation, as well as an update to the estimated settlement provision of the opioid cases (mainly the effect of the passage of time on the net present value of the discounted payments). See note 10. 
 In the first nine months of 2024, Teva recorded expenses of million in legal settlements and loss contingencies, compared to million in the first nine months of 2023. Expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were mainly related to a decision by the European Commission in its antitrust investigation into COPAXONE, and an update to the estimated settlement provision for the opioid cases (mainly the effect of the passage of time on the net present value of the discounted payments and the settlement agreement with the city of Baltimore). Expenses in the first nine months of 2023 were mainly related to an estimated provision for the DOJ patient assistance program litigation, an update to the estimated settlement provision of the opioid cases, the provision for the settlement of the U.S. DOJ criminal antitrust charges on the marketing and pricing of certain Teva USA generic products, as well as the provision for the settlement of the reverse-payment antitrust litigation over certain HIV medicines. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Teva s provision for legal settlements and loss contingencies recorded under accrued expenses and other taxes and long-term liabilities was million and million, respectively. 

million jury verdict, not including pre-
 or post-judgment interest, finding Teva liable for patent infringement. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Teva s appeal for a rehearing. The case has been remanded to the district court for further proceedings on Teva s other legal and equitable defenses that have not yet been considered by the district court. Teva recognized a provision based on its offer to settle the matter.

 in July 2010. 

million at the time of the settlement and approximately billion at the time Teva launched its generic version of Lamictal 
 in July 2008. 
 In April 2013, purported classes of direct purchasers of, and end payers for, Niaspan 
 (extended release niacin) filed claims against Teva and Abbott for violating the antitrust laws by entering into a settlement agreement in April 2005 to resolve patent litigation over the product. A multidistrict litigation has been established in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Throughout 2015 and in January 2016, several individual direct-purchaser opt-out
 plaintiffs filed complaints with allegations nearly identical to those of the direct purchasers class. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. District Court s denial of the indirect purchasers motion for class certification was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and on June 5, 2023, the Court of Appeals denied the indirect purchasers petition for re-hearing.
 In October 2016, the District Attorney for Orange County, California, filed a similar complaint in California state court, alleging violations of state law and seeking restitution and civil penalties. The California state court case is temporarily stayed. Annual sales of Niaspan 
 were approximately million at the time of the settlement and approximately billion at the time Teva launched its generic version of Niaspan 
 in September 2013. 
 In August 2019, certain direct-purchaser plaintiffs filed claims in federal court in Philadelphia against Teva and its affiliates alleging that the September 2006 patent litigation settlement relating to AndroGel 
 1 (testosterone gel) between Watson, from which Teva later acquired certain assets and liabilities, and Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Solvay violated antitrust laws. In September 2023, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed certain claims, and in September 2024, certain defendants, including the remaining Teva affiliates, and the plaintiffs agreed to settle the remaining claims. The litigation has been stayed pending finalization of the settlements. Annual sales of AndroGel 
 1 were approximately million at the time of the earlier Watson/Solvay settlement and approximately million at the time Actavis launched its generic version of AndroGel 
 1 in November 2015. A provision for this matter was previously included in the financial statements. 
 Between September 1, 2020 and December 20, 2020, plaintiffs purporting to represent putative classes of direct and indirect purchasers and opt-out
 retailer purchasers of Bystolic 
 (nebivolol hydrochloride) filed complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against several generic manufacturers, including Teva, Actavis, and Watson, alleging, among other things, that the settlement agreements these generic manufacturers entered into with Forest Laboratories, Inc., the innovator, to resolve patent litigation over Bystolic 
 violated the antitrust laws. The cases were coordinated, and the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss all claims with prejudice. The plaintiffs appealed the district court s grant of defendants motion to dismiss, and on May 13, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court s dismissal with prejudice and issued a mandate on June 4, 2024, formally ending the appeal. The plaintiffs period to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court expired. Annual sales of Bystolic 
 in the United States were approximately million at the time of Watson s 2013 settlement with Forest. 
 In November 2020, the European Commission issued a final decision in its proceedings against both Cephalon and Teva, finding that the 2005 settlement agreement between the parties had the object and effect of hindering the entry of generic modafinil, and imposed fines totaling euro million on Teva and Cephalon. Teva and Cephalon filed an appeal against the decision in February 2021, and a judgment was issued on October 18, 2023 rejecting Teva s grounds of appeal. A provision for this matter was included in the financial statements. Teva has provided the European Commission with a bank guarantee in the amount of the imposed fines. On January 4, 2024, Teva appealed the October 2023 judgment to the European Court of Justice. 
 In February 2021, the State of New Mexico filed a lawsuit against Teva and certain other defendants related to various medicines used to treat HIV (the New Mexico litigation ). Between September 2021 and April 2022, several private plaintiffs including retailers and health insurance providers filed similar claims in various courts, which were all removed and/or consolidated into the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the California litigation ). As they relate to Teva, the lawsuits challenged settlement agreements Teva entered into with Gilead in 2013 and/or 2014 to resolve patent litigation relating to Teva s generic versions of Viread 
 and/or Truvada 
 and Atripla 
, although plaintiffs in the California litigation abandoned any claim for damages relating to the Viread 
 settlement. In May 

million, billion, and billion, respectively. Annual sales in the United States at the time Teva launched its generic version of Viread 
 in 2017, Truvada 
 in 2020 and Atripla 
 in 2020 were approximately million, billion and million, respectively. 

In March 2021, the European Commission opened a formal antitrust investigation to assess whether Teva may have abused a dominant position by delaying the market entry and uptake of medicines that compete with COPAXONE. On October 10, 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections, which sets forth its preliminary allegations that Teva had engaged in anti-competitive practices. On October 31, 2024, the European Commission announced its final decision, alleging that Teva had abused a dominant position in certain European member states by (i) filing and withdrawing certain divisional patents, and (ii) raising concerns about competitors follow-on versions of COPAXONE. The decision, which Teva intends to appeal, also includes a fine of approximately million million euros). In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 450 Accounting for Contingencies, Teva recognized a provision in its financial statements in the third quarter of 2024, based on management s current best estimate of the outcome within a range of outcomes for the final resolution of this case. Teva intends to provide the European Commission a bank guarantee to cover at least a portion of the fine. 
 
 On June 29, 2021, Mylan Pharmaceuticals Mylan filed claims against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. On March 11, 2022 and March 15, 2022, purported purchasers of COPAXONE filed claims against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of themselves and similarly situated direct and indirect purchasers of COPAXONE. On August 22, 2022, additional purported purchasers of COPAXONE sued Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont on behalf of themselves and similarly situated indirect purchasers of COPAXONE. The complaints variously assert claims for alleged violations of the Lanham Act, state and federal unfair competition and monopolization laws, tortious interference, trade libel, and a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO Act ). Additionally, plaintiffs claim Teva was involved in an unlawful scheme to delay and hinder generic competition concerning COPAXONE sales. Plaintiffs seek damages for lost profits and expenses, disgorgement, restitution, treble damages, attorneys fees and costs, and injunctive relief. Teva moved to dismiss all of the complaints, and on January 22, 2024, Teva s motion to dismiss the complaint in the District of Vermont was granted as to certain state law claims but was otherwise denied. Decisions on Teva s remaining motions to dismiss are pending. 
 
 On July 15, 2021, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority CMA issued a decision imposing fines for breaches of U.K. competition law by Allergan, Actavis UK, Auden Mckenzie and a number of other companies in connection with the supply of 10mg and 20mg hydrocortisone tablets in the U.K. The decision combines the CMA s three prior investigations into the supply of hydrocortisone tablets in the U.K., as well as the CMA s subsequent investigation relating to an alleged anticompetitive agreement with Waymade. On January 9, 2017, Teva completed the sale of Actavis UK to Accord Healthcare Limited, in connection with which Teva agreed to indemnify Accord Healthcare for potential fines imposed by the CMA and/or damages awarded by a court against Actavis UK in relation to two of the three statements of objection from the CMA (dated December 16, 2016 and March 3, 2017), and resulting from conduct prior to the closing date of the sale. In addition, Teva agreed to indemnify Allergan against losses arising from this matter in the event of any such fines or damages. On October 6, 2021, Accord UK (previously Actavis UK) and Auden Mckenzie appealed to the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal (the Tribunal the CMA s decisions that the prices of hydrocortisone were unfair and excessive and that the agreements amounted to infringements of the U.K. s Competition Act as so-called pay-for-delay

 arrangements. The hearing for the appeal concluded in the first quarter of 2023, with partial judgments handed down by the Tribunal on September 18, 2023 (judgment on unfair pricing), March 8, 2024 (judgments on pay-for-delay and due process) and April 29, 2024 (judgment on fines). The CMA appealed to the U.K. Court of Appeals on an expedited basis against certain elements of the pay-for-delay and due process judgments that it had lost, and on September 6, 2024, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Tribunal s judgment on due process and, as a result, the Tribunal will now consider and issue a further judgment on fines. Accord UK and Auden Mckenzie have requested permission to appeal to the U.K. Supreme Court and have submitted to the Tribunal additional applications for permission to appeal certain other issues relating to unfair pricing and fines. A provision for the estimated exposure for Teva related to the fines and/or damages has been recorded in the financial statements. 

billion at the time of the settlement. 
 On December 2, 2022, plaintiffs purporting to represent putative classes of indirect purchasers of EpiPen 
 (epinephrine injection) and NUVIGIL 
 (armodafinil) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against Teva, Cephalon, and a former Teva executive. Teva owns the New Drug Application NDA for NUVIGIL and sold the brand product, for which generic entry occurred in 2016. Teva filed an ANDA to sell generic EpiPen 
, which Teva launched in 2018, following receipt of FDA approval. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated federal antitrust laws, the RICO Act, and various state laws in connection with settlements resolving patent litigation relating to those products. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, interest, attorneys fees and costs. On September 26, 2023, plaintiffs filed a brief in opposition to Teva s motion to dismiss the amended complaint, in which plaintiffs limited their claims only to those relating to the alleged delay of generic NUVIGIL. On March 26, 2024, the court issued its decision, which granted Teva s motion in part, dismissing plaintiffs RICO claims and certain state law claims, but denied Teva s motion regarding plaintiffs antitrust claims. On April 26, 2024, Teva sought certification to seek an interlocutory appeal of the decision, which is still pending. Annual sales of NUVIGIL in the United States were approximately million at the time Teva entered into the first settlement with an ANDA filer in 2012. 
 In May 2023, certain end-payor
 plaintiffs filed putative class action complaints in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Teva and a number of its affiliates, alleging that Teva engaged in anticompetitive conduct to suppress generic competition to its branded QVAR 
 asthma inhalers in violation of state and federal antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. Teva moved to dismiss these claims, and on May 7, 2024, the court granted Teva s motion in part and denied its motion in part. The court dismissed plaintiffs claim that Teva had engaged in sham litigation and certain of plaintiffs state antitrust and consumer protection claims, but permitted the case to proceed on the remainder of plaintiffs allegations. Following this decision, two direct purchaser plaintiffs filed similar putative class action complaints in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. On June 18, 2024, Teva answered in all cases and simultaneously moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c), which remains pending. Subsequently, on June 28, 2024, Teva stipulated to the dismissal of the two direct purchaser plaintiffs claims, with prejudice. 
 Government Investigations and Litigation Relating to Pricing and Marketing 

 Teva is involved in government investigations and litigation arising from the marketing and promotion of its pharmaceutical products in the United States. 
 In 2015 and 2016, Actavis and Teva USA each respectively received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ Antitrust Division seeking documents and other information relating to the marketing and pricing of certain Teva USA generic products and communications with competitors about such products. On August 25, 2020, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania returned a three-count indictment charging Teva USA with criminal felony Sherman Act violations. The indictment alleged that Teva USA had participated in three separate conspiracies with other 

million worth of clotrimazole and tobramycin, valued at wholesale acquisition cost WAC ), to humanitarian organizations over five years; and (iv) agreed to pay a fine in the amount of million over 5 years, with million due each year from 2024 through 2027, and million due in 2028. Teva recognized a provision for the resolution of this case. 
 In May 2018, Teva received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ Civil Division pursuant to the federal False Claims Act, seeking documents and information produced since January 1, 2009 relevant to the Civil Division s investigation concerning allegations that generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Teva, engaged in market allocation and/or price-fixing agreements, paid illegal remuneration, and caused false claims to be submitted in violation of the False Claims Act. On October 10, 2024, Teva entered into a settlement agreement with the Civil Division to resolve these allegations. Teva will pay million under the terms of the settlement million in the fourth quarter of 2024, and million in 2025 which includes no admission of wrongdoing. Teva has recognized a provision for the resolution of this matter. 
 In 2015 and 2016, Actavis and Teva USA each respectively received a subpoena from the Connecticut Attorney General seeking documents and other information relating to potential state antitrust law violations. On December 15, 2016, the civil action that was brought by the attorneys general of twenty states against Teva USA and several other companies asserting claims under federal antitrust law alleging price fixing of generic products in the United States was subsequently amended to include 49 states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as plaintiffs, and to add new allegations and state law claims against both Actavis and Teva. On May 10, 2019, most of these attorneys general filed another antitrust complaint against Actavis, Teva and other companies and individuals, which was subsequently amended on November 1, 2019, alleging that Teva was at the center of a conspiracy in the generic pharmaceutical industry and asserting that Teva and others fixed prices, rigged bids, and allocated customers and market share with respect to certain products. On June 10, 2020, most of the same states, with the addition of the U.S. Virgin Islands, filed a third complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut naming, among other defendants, Actavis, in a similar complaint relating to dermatological generics products, and that complaint was later amended to, among other things, add California as a plaintiff. 
 In the various complaints described above, which also include claims against certain former employees of Actavis and Teva USA, the states seek a finding that the defendants actions violated federal antitrust law and state antitrust and consumer protection laws, as well as injunctive relief, disgorgement, damages on behalf of various state and governmental entities and consumers, civil penalties and costs. All such complaints were transferred to the generic drug multidistrict litigation in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania MDL ). On May 7, 2021, the Pennsylvania MDL court chose the attorneys general s third complaint filed on June 10, 2020, as subsequently amended, to serve as a bellwether complaint in the Pennsylvania MDL, along with certain complaints filed by private plaintiffs. On June 7, 2022, the Court dismissed the attorneys general s claims for monetary relief under federal law, concluding that the federal statute under which the attorneys general brought suit authorizes injunctive relief only. However, the attorneys general have pending claims for monetary relief under state law. On February 27, 2023, the Court largely denied defendants motions to dismiss the federal claims asserted by the attorneys general in their bellwether complaint. Another motion to dismiss related to the state law claims asserted by the attorneys general in their bellwether complaint remains pending. 
 Teva has settled with the states of Mississippi (in June 2021), Louisiana (in March 2022), Georgia (in September 2022), Arkansas (in October 2022), Florida (in February 2023), Kentucky (in June 2023), South Dakota (in June 2024), and New Mexico (in June 2024). Teva paid each state an amount proportional to its share of the national population (approximately for each share of the national population), and the states have dismissed their claims against Actavis and Teva USA, as well as certain former employees of Actavis and Teva USA, pursuant to these settlements. These settlements, in addition to the status of ongoing negotiations with several other U.S. state attorneys general to settle on comparable terms, caused management to consider settlement of the claims filed by the remaining 

billion in damages, which would automatically be trebled in the event of an adverse verdict, and Teva would also be subject to mandatory statutory penalties for each false claim, the amount of which (potentially billions of U.S. dollars in additional penalties, at the high end) would be determined by the court within a statutory range. On October 10, 2024, Teva entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve these claims. Teva will pay million over 6 years under the terms of the settlement million in the fourth quarter of 2024, million in 2025, million in each of 2026 and 2027, million in 2028, and million in 2029 which includes no admission of wrongdoing. Teva has recognized a provision for the resolution of this case. Additionally, on January 8, 2021, Humana, Inc. Humana filed an action against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida based on the allegations raised in the DOJ PAP Complaint. In June 2023, Teva filed a joint motion to dismiss the amended complaint, together with co-defendant
 Advanced Care Scripts, Inc., on the grounds that Humana lacks standing to assert RICO claims and the claims are time-barred and/or insufficiently pled, and that motion remains pending. On November 17, 2022, United Healthcare also filed an action against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey based on the conduct alleged in the DOJ PAP Complaint, and on February 29, 2024, United Healthcare filed an amended complaint. On August 16, 2024, several MSP Recovery-related entities filed a putative class action against Teva and others in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas based on the alleged conduct in the DOJ PAP Complaint. 

billion (including the already settled cases), spread over years. This total includes the supply of up to billion of Teva s generic version of Narcan 
 (naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray), valued at wholesale acquisition cost, over 10 years or cash at of the wholesale acquisition cost million) in lieu of product. In September 2024, Teva reached and finalized an agreement with the City of Baltimore to settle its opioid-related claims for a total of million (of which million will be paid by the end of 2024 and the remainder will be paid by July 1, 2025), averting a trial that was scheduled to begin on September 16, 2024. 

of the U.S. states and litigating political subdivisions and the Native American tribes (the Tribes ). Teva s estimated cash payments between 2024 and 2028 for all opioids settlements are: million payable in 2024 (of which million was paid as of September 30, 2024), million payable in 2025; million payable in 2026; million payable in 2027; and million payable in 2028. These payments are subject to change based on various factors including, but not limited to, timing of payments, most favored nations clauses associated with prior settlements, and the states elections to take Teva s generic version of Narcan 
 (naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray). The remaining payments, subject to adjustments, will be paid beyond 2028. 
 Various Teva affiliates, along with several other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in opioids cases initiated by approximately 500 U.S. hospitals and other healthcare providers asserting opioid-related claims, including public nuisance. Specifically, the lawsuits brought by the hospitals allege that they have incurred financial harm from increased operating costs for treating patients whose underlying illnesses are purportedly exacerbated or complicated by opioid addiction. In September 2024, Teva and the representatives for acute care hospitals finalized the terms of a proposed settlement agreement. Under the financial terms of the proposed national settlement agreement, Teva will pay up to million in cash, spread over years, and supply up to million of Teva s generic version of Narcan 
 (naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray), valued at wholesale acquisition cost, over years. The proposed settlement agreement is contingent upon Teva s satisfaction, in its sole discretion, with the level of participation by acute care hospitals and health care systems in the proposed settlement agreement. 
 In light of the nationwide settlement agreement between Teva and the States Attorneys General and their subdivisions, Teva s indemnification obligations arising from Teva s acquisition of the Actavis Generics business for opioid-related claims, prior settlements reached with Louisiana, Texas, Rhode Island, Florida, San Francisco, West Virginia, New York, the Tribes, Nevada and the City of Baltimore, the agreement in principle with the hospitals discussed above, as well as an estimate for a number of items including, but not limited to, costs associated with administering injunctive terms, and most favored nations clauses associated with prior settlements, the Company has recorded a provision. The provision is a reasonable estimate of the ultimate costs for Teva s opioids settlements, after discounting payments to their net present value. Opioid-related lawsuits brought against Teva by dozens of third-party payers, such as unions and welfare funds, remain pending. A reasonable upper end of a range of loss cannot be determined for the entirety of the remaining opioid-related cases. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits or investigations may involve large monetary penalties, damages, and/or other forms of monetary and non-monetary
 relief and could have a material and adverse effect on Teva s reputation, business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition, Teva, certain of its subsidiaries and other defendants, are defending claims and putative class action lawsuits in Canada related to the manufacture, sale, marketing and distribution of opioid medications. The lawsuits include a claim by the Province of British Columbia on behalf of itself and a putative class of other federal and provincial governments, and claims of municipalities, First Nations, and persons who used opioids on behalf of themselves and putative classes. In November and December 2023, the British Columbia Supreme Court held a hearing regarding preliminary motions, including plaintiffs certification motion, which remain pending. 
 Shareholder Litigation 

 On November 6, 2016 and December 27, 2016, two putative securities class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against Teva and certain of its current and former officers and directors. Those lawsuits subsequently were consolidated and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut (the Ontario Teachers Securities Litigation ). On December 13, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint, purportedly on behalf of purchasers of Teva s securities between February 6, 2014 and May 10, 2019, asserting that Teva and certain of its current and former officers and directors violated federal securities and common laws in connection with Teva s alleged failure to disclose pricing strategies for various drugs in its generic drug portfolio and by making allegedly false or misleading statements in certain offering materials. From July 2017 to June 2019, other putative securities class actions were filed in other federal courts based on similar allegations and claims, and were transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. Between August 2017 and January 2022, twenty-three complaints were filed against Teva and certain of its current and former officers and directors on behalf of plaintiffs in various forums across the country, but many of those plaintiffs opted-out 
 of the Ontario Teachers Securities Litigation. On January 18, 2022, Teva entered into a settlement in the Ontario Teachers Securities Litigation for million, which received final approval from the court on June 2, 2022. The vast majority of the total settlement amount was covered by the Company s insurance carriers, with a small portion contributed by Teva. Additionally, as part of the settlement, Teva admitted no liability and denied all allegations of wrongdoing. On January 22, 2021, the Court dismissed the opt-out 
 plaintiffs claims arising from statements made prior to the five-year statute of repose, but denied Teva s motion to dismiss their claims under Israeli laws. Teva has settled the majority of the opt-out 
 claims, and one opt-out
 case remains outstanding. Teva also reached a settlement with shareholders who filed class actions in Israel with similar allegations to those raised in the Ontario Teachers Securities Litigation, which was approved by the court in Israel in November 2023. 

. The following matter is disclosed in accordance with that requirement. On July 8, 2021, the National Green Tribunal Principal Bench, New Delhi, issued an order against Teva s subsidiary in India, Teva API India Private Limited, finding non-compliance
 with environmental laws and assessed a penalty of million. The Company disputed certain of the findings and the amount of the penalty and filed an appeal before the Supreme Court of India. On August 5, 2021, the Supreme Court of India admitted the appeal for hearing and granted an interim unconditional stay on the National Green Tribunal s order. The Company does not believe that the eventual outcome of such matter will have a material effect on its business. 

million, an amount they alleged was equivalent to the milestones payable to the former shareholders of Ception in the event Cephalon were to obtain regulatory approval for EE in the United States million) and Europe million). On December 28, 2018, following defendants motion to dismiss the complaint, the court granted the motion in part and dismissed all of plaintiffs claims, except for their claim against Cephalon for breach of contract. In November 2021, plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to, among other things, reassert claims against the Company and Teva USA. However, on July 12, 2022, plaintiffs filed a new amended complaint that included claims against Teva USA but not the Company, in exchange for Teva USA s agreement to guarantee any judgment entered against Cephalon in the litigation. A bench trial for this matter was held in September 2022 and on April 30, 2024, the court issued a memorandum opinion in favor of Cephalon and Teva USA, finding that they did not breach the merger agreement as plaintiffs had alleged. Plaintiffs have appealed that ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court, and the appeal remains pending. 
 Gain Contingencies 

 From time to time, Teva may directly or indirectly pursue claims against certain parties, including but not limited to patent infringement lawsuits against other pharmaceutical companies to protect its patent rights, as well as derivative actions brought on behalf of Teva. Teva recognizes gain contingencies from the defendants in such lawsuits when they are realized or when all related contingencies have been resolved. No gain has been recognized regarding the matters disclosed below, unless mentioned otherwise. 
 In October 2017, Teva filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that Eli Lilly Co. s Lilly marketing and sale of its galcanezumab product for the treatment of migraine infringes nine Teva patents, including three method of treatment patents and six composition of matter patents. Lilly then submitted inter partes review IPR petitions to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board PTAB ), challenging the validity of the nine Teva patents. The PTAB issued decisions upholding the three method of treatment patents but finding the six composition of matter patents invalid, which decisions were affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on August 16, 2021. A jury trial regarding the three method of treatment patents resulted in a verdict in Teva s favor on November 9, 2022, in which the three method of treatment patents were determined to be valid and infringed by Lilly and Teva was awarded million in damages. On September 26, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued a decision that reversed the jury s verdict and damages award, finding Teva s method of treatment patents to be invalid. Teva filed its opening appeal brief on February 2, 2024 and Lilly filed its responsive brief on April 19, 2024. Teva filed its responsive brief on May 29, 2024, and Lilly s final brief was filed on July 19, 2024. No date has been set for the appeal hearing. 
 In March 2024, Teva filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging that Amarin Pharma, Inc., Amarin Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited, and Amarin Corporation plc (collectively Amarin engaged in a decade-long scheme to lock up the supply of icosapent ethyl to prevent and delay generic competition to its branded Vascepa 
 drug product. Teva s lawsuit coincides with four other lawsuits brought by generic drug manufacturers and purchasers of branded Vascepa 
 alleging the same or similar conduct by Amarin. Teva s requested relief includes compensatory damages for lost sales and lost profits from generic icosapent ethyl drug sales that Teva could have made absent Amarin s alleged interference. On May 24, 2024, Amarin filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, seeking to enforce the terms of an earlier Teva-Amarin agreement to settle patent litigation regarding Vascepa 
, which Amarin asserts precludes Teva from filing the present antitrust action. Teva opposed this motion on June 7, 2024, and Amarin s motion remains pending. As the lawsuit is still in its initial stages, it is not possible to predict its outcome and there is no guarantee that Teva will be granted its requested relief. 
 In June 2024, Teva filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Corcept Therapeutics, Inc. Corcept ), and Optime Care Inc. Optime have engaged in a multifaceted, years-long scheme to stifle generic competition to Corcept s branded Korlym 
 (mifepristone) drug product, which is indicated to treat endogenous Cushing s syndrome. Teva alleges that Corcept and Optime have suppressed competition by abusing the

 million, on a pre-tax
 loss
 of million. In the third quarter of 2023, Teva recognized a tax benefit of million, on a pre-tax income

of million. Teva s tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was mainly impacted by impairment charges with no corresponding tax effects, an adjustment to the Company s corporate tax rate in Israel on losses related to non-qualified
 tax incentive activities in Israel, legal expenses with no corresponding tax effect related to the fine issued by the European Commission in connection with its antitrust investigation into COPAXONE, and recording of valuation allowance with respect to certain carry over credits outside of Israel. Teva s tax rate for the third quarter for 2023 was mainly affected by deferred tax benefits resulting from intellectual property related integration plans, which have been adopted, among others, in an effort of addressing the global adoption of the Organization for Economic Co-operation
 and Development (OECD) Pillar Two minimum effective corporate tax. The pre-tax
 loss in the third quarter of 2023 was revised as discussed in note 1c. 

 In the first nine months of 2024, Teva recognized a tax expense of million, on a pre-tax
 loss of million. In the first nine months of 2023, Teva recognized a tax benefit of million, on a pre-tax
 loss of million. Teva s tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was mainly impacted by a settlement agreement with the Israeli Tax Authorities ITA as discussed below, impairment charges with no corresponding tax effects, deferred tax benefits resulting from intellectual property related integration plans, an adjustment to the Company s corporate tax rate in Israel on losses related to non-qualified
 tax incentives activities in Israel, legal expenses with no corresponding tax effect related to the fine issued by the European Commission in connection with its antitrust investigation into COPAXONE, and recording of valuation allowance with respect to certain carry over credits outside of Israel. Teva s tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 was mainly affected by deferred tax benefits from intellectual property related integration plans, impairments, legal settlements, and interest expense disallowances. The pre-tax
 loss in the first nine months of 2023 was revised as discussed in note 1c. 

 The statutory Israeli corporate tax rate is in 2024. Teva s global tax rate differs from the Israeli statutory tax rate, mainly due to generation of profits in various jurisdictions in which tax rates are different than the Israeli tax rate, tax benefits, as well as infrequent or non-recurring
 items. 
 Teva filed a claim seeking the refund of withholding taxes paid to the Indian tax authorities in 2012. A trial for this case is currently ongoing. A final and binding decision against Teva in this case may lead to a charge of million. 
 On June 23, 2024, Teva entered into an agreement with the ITA to settle certain litigation with respect to taxes payable for the Company s taxable years 2008 through 2020 (the Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company will pay a total amount of approximately million to the ITA spread over a 
 period beginning this year. The Company has the right to prepay, and amounts paid over time are subject to interest and increase for inflation. Such total amount includes: (i) million in corporate taxes with respect to the Company s historical earnings that were previously considered by the Company to be exempt from taxes under the Encouragement for Capital Investment Law; and (ii) approximately million in corporate taxes, relating to additional disputed tax issues in the aforementioned taxable years. The Agreement resulted in an increase of million in the Company s total income taxes in the second quarter of 2024, as certain elements had been recognized in previous periods. Additionally, under the terms of the Agreement, it was further agreed that in the future event the Company pays dividends on, or repurchases, its equity interests, the Company will pay an additional - 
 of the amount of such dividends or repurchases in corporate taxes, up to a maximum tax payment amount of approximately million. Any amounts due under this provision of the Agreement will be recorded in the future as incurred. 
 Teva believes it has adequately provided for all of its uncertain tax positions, including items currently under dispute, however, adverse results could be material. 
 The OECD introduced Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS Pillar Two rules that impose a global minimum tax rate of for large multinational corporations. On December 12, 2022, the EU Council announced that EU member states had reached an agreement to implement the minimum taxation component of of the OECD s reform of international taxation. Other countries have also enacted or are expected to enact legislation to be effective as early as January 1, 2024, with general implementation of a global minimum tax by January 1, 2025. Teva has evaluated the potential impact on its 2024 consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and does not expect Pillar Two to have a material impact on its effective tax rate or consolidated financial statements in the foreseeable future.

In the three months ended September 30, 2024, Teva recorded an income of 

million under impairments of tangible assets, compared to an expense of 

million 

 in the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 The income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly related to a favorable adjustment to the changes of the expected loss from reclassification of currency translation adjustments, partially offset by an additional impairment due to fair value update in connection with the classification of the business venture in Japan as held for sale. See note 2.

 Impairments of tangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million and million, respectively. The impairment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly related to the classification of the business venture in Japan as held for sale (see note 2).

 Teva may record additional impairments in the future, to the extent it changes its plans on any given asset and/or the assumptions underlying such plans, as a result of its ongoing network consolidation activities and its Pivot to Growth Strategy . 
 Contingent consideration 

In the three months ended September 30, 2024, Teva recorded an expense of million for contingent consideration, compared to an expense of million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were mainly due to the effect of the passage of time on the net present value of the discounted payments. The expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2023 were mainly related to a change in the estimated future royalty payments to Allergan in connection with lenalidomide capsules (the generic version of Revlimid) and a change in the estimated future royalty payments to Eagle in connection with expected future bendamustine sales. The expense in the three months ended September 30, 2023 was revised as discussed in note 1c.

NOTE 13 Earnings (Loss) per share: 

 Basic earnings and loss per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to Teva s ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, including fully vested restricted share units RSUs and performance share units PSUs during the period, net of treasury shares. 

In computing diluted loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, no account was taken of the potential dilution that could occur upon the exercise of options and non-vested RSUs and PSUs granted under employee stock compensation plans, and convertible senior debentures, since they had an anti-dilutive effect on loss per share. 

In computing diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023, basic earnings per share were adjusted to take into account the potential dilution that could occur upon the exercise of options and non-vested RSUs and PSUs granted under employee stock compensation plans. No account was taken of the potential dilution by the convertible senior debentures, since they had an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share.

 platform offering a portfolio of products to other pharmaceutical companies through its affiliate Medis. 
 Teva s Chief Executive Officer CEO ), who is the chief operating decision maker CODM ), reviews financial information prepared on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues and contributed profit by the three identified reportable segments, namely United States, Europe and International Markets, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance. 
 Segment profit is comprised of gross profit for the segment less R D expenses, S M expenses, G A expenses and other income related to the segment. Segment profit does not include amortization and certain other items. 
 Teva manages its assets on a company basis, not by segments, as many of its assets are shared or commingled. Teva s CODM does not regularly review asset information by reportable segment and, therefore, Teva does not report asset information by reportable segment. 
 Teva s CEO may review its strategy and organizational structure from time to time. Based on such review, in May 2023 Teva launched its new Pivot to Growth strategy. Any additional changes in strategy may lead to a reevaluation of the Company s segments and goodwill allocation to reporting units, as well as fair value attributable to its reporting units. See note 3 and note 6. 
 In conjunction with a recent shift in executive management responsibilities and in alignment with Teva s Pivot to Growth strategy, Teva decided that Canada is no longer included as part of Teva s North America segment as of January 1, 2024. From that date Canada is reported as part of the Company s International Markets segment and Teva s North America segment has been renamed the United States segment. Teva aligned its internal financial and segment reporting and its reporting units in accordance with this change effective January 1, 2024. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the reporting structure for the current year. 
 On January 31, 2024, Teva announced that it intends to divest its API business (including its R D, manufacturing and commercial activities) through a sale, which divestment is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. The intention to divest is in alignment with Teva s Pivot to Growth strategy. However, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing or structure of a potential divestiture or that a divestiture will be agreed or completed at all.

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Business Overview We are a global pharmaceutical leader, harnessing our generics expertise and stepping up innovation to continue the momentum behind the discovery, delivery, and expanded development of modern medicine. We operate worldwide, with headquarters in Israel and a significant presence in the United States, Europe and many other markets around the world. Today, our global network of capabilities enables our approximately 37,000 employees across 58 markets to push the boundaries of scientific innovation and deliver quality medicines to help improve health outcomes of millions of patients every day. Teva was incorporated in Israel on February 13, 1944 and is the successor to a number of Israeli corporations, the oldest of which was established in 1901. Our Business Segments We operate our business through three segments: United States (previously referred to as North America segment, see below United States Segment ), Europe and International Markets. Each business segment manages our entire product portfolio in its region, including generics, which includes biosimilars and OTC products, as well as innovative medicines. This structure enables strong alignment and integration between operations, commercial regions, R D and our global marketing and portfolio function, optimizing our product lifecycle across therapeutic areas. In addition to these three segments, we have other activities, primarily the sale of API to third parties, certain contract manufacturing services and an out-licensing platform offering a portfolio of products to other pharmaceutical companies through our affiliate Medis. Pivot to Growth Strategy In May 2023, we introduced our Pivot to Growth strategy, which is based on four key pillars: (i) delivering on our growth engines, mainly AUSTEDO , AJOVY , UZEDY and our late-stage pipeline of biosimilars; (ii) stepping up innovation through delivering on our late-stage innovative pipeline assets as well as building up our early-stage pipeline organically and potentially through business development activities; (iii) sustaining our generics medicines powerhouse with a global commercial footprint, focused portfolio, pipeline and manufacturing footprint; and (iv) focusing our business by optimizing our portfolio and global manufacturing footprint to enable strategic capital deployment to accelerate our near and long-term growth engines and reorganizing certain of our business units to a more optimal structure, while also reorganizing key business units to enhance operational efficiency. Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Environment In recent years, the global economy has been impacted by fluctuating foreign exchange rates. In the third quarter of 2024, approximately 45 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we manufacture our products largely outside of the United States. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar versus other currencies in which we operate may materially impact our revenues, results of operations, profits and cash flows. Additionally, high levels of inflation have recently resulted in significant economic volatility and monetary tightening by central banks through higher interest rates. Global economy has also been impacted by geopolitical tensions which have resulted in disruptions to global supply chains, including our internal supply chain. In October 2023, Israel was attacked by a terrorist organization and entered a state of war on several fronts, which as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is ongoing. Our global headquarters as well as several of our manufacturing and R D facilities are located in Israel and, while operations there currently remain largely unaffected, the impact of this war on our operations may increase, which could be material, as a result of the continuation, escalation or expansion of this war. In light of the above, supply chain disruptions could continue to result in delays in our production and distribution processes, R D initiatives and our ability to timely respond to consumer demand. We have implemented certain measures in response to such events and are continually considering various initiatives, including price adjustments where we are not restricted contractually or regulatorily, enhanced inventory management, alternative sourcing strategies for our raw material supply and backup production plans for key products, to allow us to partially mitigate and offset the impact of these macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. However, although inflationary and other macroeconomic pressures may or have eased, the higher costs we have experienced during recent periods have already impacted our operations and will likely continue to have an effect on our financial results.

Table of Contents 

Highlights Significant highlights in the third quarter of 2024 included 1 : 

Revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were 4,332 million, an increase of 13 in U.S. dollars, or 15 in local currency terms, compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase was mainly due to higher revenues from generic products in all our segments, from AUSTEDO in our United States segment, as well as from the sale of product rights in our Europe and International Markets segments. 

Our United States segment generated revenues of 2,225 million and segment profit of 748 million in the third quarter of 2024. Revenues increased by 17 and segment profit increased by 31 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 

Our Europe segment generated revenues of 1,265 million and segment profit of 373 million in the third quarter of 2024. Revenues increased by 10 in U.S. dollars, or 11 in local currency terms, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Segment profit increased by 10 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 

Our International Markets segment generated revenues of 613 million and segment profit of 109 million in the third quarter of 2024. Revenues increased by 4 in U.S. dollars, or 18 in local currency terms, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Segment profit decreased by 7 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 

Our revenues from other activities in the third quarter of 2024 were 229 million, an increase of 6 in U.S. dollars, or 5 local currency terms, compared to the third quarter of 2023. 

Exchange rate movements during the third quarter of 2024, including hedging effects, negatively impacted overall revenues by 88 million and operating loss by 57 million, compared to the third quarter of 2023. 

Gross profit margin was 49.6 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 48.1 in the third quarter of 2023. 

R D expenses, net in the third quarter of 2024 were 240 million, a decrease of 5 compared to 253 million in the third quarter of 2023. 

We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 600 million in the third quarter of 2024, related to our Teva API reporting unit. See note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. 

We recorded legal settlements and loss contingencies of 450 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 314 million in the third quarter of 2023. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. 

Operating loss was 51 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to an operating income of 344 million in the third quarter of 2023. 

In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a tax expense of 69 million, on a pre-tax loss of 324 million. In the third quarter of 2023, we recognized a tax benefit of 12 million, on a pre-tax income of 64 million. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. 

As of September 30, 2024, our debt was 18,980 million, compared to 19,833 million as of December 31, 2023. In October 2024, we repaid at maturity 685 million of our 1.13 senior notes due in 2024. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. 

Cash flow generated from operating activities during the third quarter of 2024 was 693 million, compared to 5 million of cash flow generated from operating activities in the third quarter of 2023. The higher cash flow generated from operating activities in the third quarter of 2024, resulted mainly from higher profit in our United States segment, as well as from changes in working capital items, including a positive impact from accounts receivables, net of SR A, as well as from accounts payables and inventory levels, partially offset by higher legal payments during the third quarter of 2024.

Table of Contents 

During the third quarter of 2024, we generated free cash flow of 922 million, which we define as comprising 693 million in cash flow generated from operating activities, 339 million in beneficial interest collected in exchange for securitized accounts receivables (under our EU securitization program) and 38 million in divestitures of businesses and other assets, partially offset by 148 million in cash used for capital investment. During the third quarter of 2023, we generated free cash flow of 229 million. The increase in the third quarter of 2024, resulted mainly from higher cash flow generated from operating activities.

Revenues from our United States segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 2,225 million, an increase of 329 million, or 17 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase was mainly due to higher revenues from generic products, AUSTEDO and UZEDY, partially offset by lower revenues from certain innovative products, primarily COPAXONE and BENDEKA and TREANDA.

Generic products revenues in our United States segment (including biosimilars) in the third quarter of 2024 were 1,094 million, an increase of 30 compared to the third quarter of 2023, the majority of which is driven by higher revenues from lenalidomide capsules (the generic version of Revlimid ), and the remaining, primarily by the launch of liraglutide injection 1.8mg (an authorized generic of Victoza and higher revenues from epinephrine injectable solution (the generic equivalent of EpiPen and EpiPen Jr ). Among the most significant generic products we sold in the United States in the third quarter of 2024 were lenalidomide capsules (the generic version of Revlimid ), epinephrine injectable solution (the generic equivalent of EpiPen and EpiPen Jr ), Truxima (the biosimilar to Rituxan and liraglutide 1.8 mg injection (an authorized generic of Victoza ). In the third quarter of 2024, our total prescriptions were approximately 292 million (based on trailing twelve months), representing 7.6 of total U.S. generic prescriptions, compared to approximately 320 million (based on trailing twelve months), representing 8.4 of total U.S. generic prescriptions in the third quarter of 2023, all according to IQVIA data. On October 1, 2024, Teva launched octreotide acetate for injectable suspension, the first generic version of Sandostatin LAR Depot. Octreotide acetate for injectable suspension is indicated for the treatment of acromegaly and severe diarrhea associated with carcinoid syndrome, and is available to patients in the U.S. AJOVY revenues in our United States segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 58 million, an increase of 4 compared to the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to growth in volume. In the third quarter of 2024, AJOVY s exit market share in the United States in terms of total number of prescriptions was 29.1 compared to 24.9 in the third quarter of 2023. AJOVY is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults, and was launched in the U.S. in 2018. AJOVY is the only anti-CGRP subcutaneous product indicated for quarterly treatment. AJOVY is protected worldwide by patents expiring in 2026 at the earliest; extensions have been granted in several countries, including the United States and in Europe, until 2031. Additional patents relating to the use of AJOVY in the treatment of migraine have also been issued in the United States and will expire between 2035 and 2039. Such patents are also pending in other countries. AJOVY will also be protected by regulatory exclusivity for 12 years from marketing approval in the United States (obtained in September 2018) and 10 years from marketing approval in Europe (obtained in April 2019). In October 2017, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that Eli Lilly Co. s Lilly marketing and sale of its galcanezumab product for the treatment of migraine infringes nine Teva patents, including three method of treatment patents and six composition of matter patents. Lilly then submitted inter partes review IPR petitions to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board PTAB ), challenging the validity of the nine Teva patents. The PTAB issued decisions upholding the three method of treatment patents but finding the six composition of matter patents invalid, which decisions were affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on August 16, 2021. A jury trial regarding the three method of treatment patents resulted in a verdict in Teva s favor on November 9, 2022, in which the three method of treatment patents were determined to be valid and infringed by Lilly, and Teva was awarded 176.5 million in damages. On September 26, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued a decision that reversed the jury s verdict and damages award, finding Teva s method of treatment patents to be invalid. Teva appealed this ruling on October 24, 2023. On February 2, 2024, Teva filed its opening appeal brief, to which Lilly filed its responding brief on April 19, 2024, which Teva responded to on May 29, 2024. Lilly s final brief was filed on July 19, 2024. No date has been set for the appeal hearing.

In addition, in 2018 we entered into separate agreements with Alder Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lilly, resolving the European Patent Office oppositions that they filed against our AJOVY patents. The settlement agreement with Lilly also resolved Lilly s action to revoke the patent protecting AJOVY in the United Kingdom. AUSTEDO revenues in our United States segment in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 28 , to 435 million, compared to 339 million in the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to growth in volume and expanded access for patients. AUSTEDO was launched in the U.S. in 2017. It is indicated for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in adults. AUSTEDO is protected in the United States by 14 Orange Book patents expiring between 2031 and 2038. We received notice letters from two ANDA filers regarding the filing of their ANDAs with paragraph (IV) certifications for certain of the patents listed in the Orange Book for AUSTEDO. On July 1, 2021, we filed claims against two generic ANDA filers, Aurobindo and Lupin, in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In addition, Apotex filed a petition for IPR by the PTAB of the patent covering the deutetrabenazine compound that expires in 2031. On March 9, 2022, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied Apotex s petition and declined to institute a review of the deutetrabenazine patent. On April 29, 2022 and June 8, 2022, we reached agreements with Lupin and Aurobindo, respectively, to sell their generic products beginning in April 2033, or earlier under certain circumstances. There are no further patent litigations pending regarding AUSTEDO. AUSTEDO XR (deutetrabenazine) extended-release tablets was approved by the FDA on February 17, 2023, in three doses of 6, 12 and 24 mg, and became commercially available in the U.S. in May 2023. In May 2024, the FDA approved AUSTEDO XR as a one pill, once-daily treatment option in doses of 30, 36, 42, and 48 mg. In July 2024, the FDA approved the 18 mg dosage for AUSTEDO XR making it a one pill, once-daily option for all available doses. AUSTEDO XR is a once-daily formulation indicated in adults for tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington s disease, which is additional to the currently marketed twice-daily AUSTEDO. AUSTEDO XR is protected by 11 Orange Book patents expiring between 2031 and 2041. UZEDY (risperidone) extended-release injectable suspension revenues in our United States segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 35 million. UZEDY was approved by the FDA on April 28, 2023 for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults, and was launched in the U.S. in May 2023. UZEDY is a subcutaneous, long-acting formulation of risperidone that controls the steady release of risperidone. UZEDY is protected by nine Orange Book patents expiring between 2025 and 2033. We are moving forward with plans to launch UZEDY in other countries around the world. UZEDY faces competition from multiple other products. BENDEKA and TREANDA combined revenues in our United States segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 40 million, a decrease of 28 compared to the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to competition from alternative therapies, as well as the entry of generic bendamustine products into the market. The orphan drug exclusivity that had attached to bendamustine products expired in December 2022. In April 2019, we signed an amendment to the license agreement with Eagle extending the royalty term applicable to the United States to the full period for which we sell BENDEKA and increased the royalty rate. In consideration, Eagle agreed to assume a portion of BENDEKA-related patent litigation expenses. There are 18 patents listed in the U.S. Orange Book for BENDEKA with expiration dates in 2026 and 2031. In April 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware issued a trial decision upholding the validity of all of the asserted patents and finding that four ANDA filers for generic versions of BENDEKA infringe at least one of the patents. Teva settled with one of the three ANDA filers that appealed the district court s decision, and on August 13, 2021, the Federal Circuit issued a Rule 36 affirmance of such decision. Litigation against the fifth ANDA filer was dismissed after withdrawal of its patent challenge, and on October 18, 2021, the case against a sixth ANDA filer was also settled. Teva also settled litigations against three 505(b)(2) applicants, Hospira, Inc. Hospira ), Dr. Reddy s Laboratories DRL and Accord Healthcare Accord ). Based on these settlement agreements, the three 505(b)(2) filers, Hospira, Accord and DRL can launch their products on November 17, 2027 or earlier under certain circumstances. On May 4, 2023, and June 9, 2023, Teva and Eagle also filed suit against BendaRx Corp. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, following its filing of a 505(b)(2) NDA for a bendamustine product. In addition, on June 16, 2023, Teva filed suit against BendaRx USA Corp. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Eastern Virginia, which was then stayed and has now been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware where it has been consolidated with the suits filed there.

In addition to the settlement with Eagle regarding its bendamustine 505(b)(2) NDA, between 2015 and 2020, we reached final settlements with 22 ANDA filers for generic versions of the lyophilized form of TREANDA and one 505(b)(2) NDA filer for a generic version of the liquid form of TREANDA, providing for the launch of generic versions of TREANDA prior to patent expiration. Currently, there are multiple generic TREANDA products on the market. COPAXONE revenues in our United States segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 69 million, a decrease of 30 compared to the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to market share erosion and competition. The market for MS treatments continues to develop, particularly with the approval of generic versions of COPAXONE. Oral treatments for MS, such as Tecfidera , Gilenya and Aubagio , continue to present significant and increasing competition. COPAXONE also continues to face competition from existing injectable products, as well as from monoclonal antibodies, such as Ocrevus and Kesimpta . Anda revenues from third-party products in our United States segment in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 3 to 380 million, compared to 367 million in the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to higher volumes. Anda, our distribution business in the United States, distributes generic and innovative medicines and OTC pharmaceutical products from Teva and various third-party manufacturers to independent retail pharmacies, pharmacy retail chains, hospitals and physician offices in the United States. Anda is able to compete in the distribution market by maintaining a broad portfolio of products, competitive pricing and delivery throughout the United States.

The figures presented are for the twelve months ended in the calendar quarter immediately prior to our launch or re-launch. 

Represents estimated sales based on OTC sales reported through IQVIA. As of September 30, 2024, our generic products pipeline in the United States includes 125 product applications awaiting FDA approval, including 62 tentative approvals. This total reflects all pending ANDAs, supplements for product line extensions and tentatively approved applications and includes some instances where more than one application was submitted for the same reference product. Excluding overlaps, the branded products underlying these pending applications had U.S. sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024 of approximately 119 billion, according to IQVIA. Approximately 79 of pending applications include a paragraph IV patent challenge, and we believe we are first-to-file with respect to 55 of these products, or 85 products including final approvals where launch is pending a settlement agreement or court decision. Collectively, these first-to-file opportunities represent over 79 billion in U.S. brand sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, according to IQVIA. IQVIA reported brand sales are one of the many indicators of future potential value of a launch, but equally important are the mix and timing of competition, as well as cost effectiveness. The potential advantages of being the first filer with respect to some of these products may be subject to forfeiture, shared exclusivity or competition from so-called authorized generics, which may ultimately affect the value derived.

Table of Contents 

In the third quarter of 2024, we received tentative approvals for generic equivalents of the products listed in the table below, excluding overlapping applications. A tentative approval indicates that the FDA has substantially completed its review of an application and final approval is expected once the relevant patent expires, a court decision is reached, a 30-month regulatory stay lapses, or a 180-day exclusivity period awarded to another manufacturer either expires or is forfeited.

Revenues from our Europe segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 1,265 million, an increase of 10 , or 119 million, compared to the third quarter of 2023. In local currency terms, revenues increased by 11 compared to the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to higher revenues from generic and OTC products as well as AJOVY. Our higher revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were also partly driven by the sale of certain product rights. In the third quarter of 2024, revenues were negatively impacted by exchange rate fluctuations of 6 million, net of hedging effects, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Revenues in the third quarter of 2024, included 10 million from a negative hedging impact, which is included in Other in the table below.

Generic products revenues (including OTC and biosimilar products) in our Europe segment in the third quarter of 2024, were 973 million, an increase of 10 compared to the third quarter of 2023. In local currency terms, revenues increased by 8 , mainly due to price increases as a result of market conditions such as inflationary pressures in certain markets, as well as higher revenues from recently launched products. AJOVY revenues in our Europe segment in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 37 to 56 million, compared to 41 million in the third quarter of 2023. In local currency terms revenues increased by 36 due to growth in volume. For information about AJOVY patent protection, see United States Revenues Revenues by Major Products and Activities above. COPAXONE revenues in our Europe segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 53 million, a decrease of 5 in both U.S. dollars and local currency terms, compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to price reductions and a decline in volume resulting from availability of alternative therapies and competing glatiramer acetate products. In certain countries, Teva remains in litigation against generic companies regarding COPAXONE. Respiratory products revenues in our Europe segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 60 million, a decrease of 1 compared to the third quarter of 2023. In local currency terms, revenues decreased by 3 compared to the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to net price reductions and lower volumes. Product Launches and Pipeline As of September 30, 2024, our generic products pipeline in Europe included 412 generic approvals relating to 53 compounds in 108 formulations, with no European Medicines Agency EMA approvals received. In addition, approximately 1,508 marketing authorization applications are pending approval in 37 European countries, relating to 94 compounds in 215 formulations.

Represents an amount less than 0.5 million or 0.5 , as applicable. International Markets Revenues Our International Markets segment includes all countries in which we operate other than the United States and the countries included in our Europe segment. The International Markets segment includes more than 35 countries, covering a substantial portion of the global pharmaceutical industry. As part of a recent shift in executive management responsibilities, commencing January 1, 2024, Canada is reported under our International Markets segment and is no longer included as part of our United States segment. Prior period amounts were recast to reflect this change. See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. The countries in our International Markets segment include highly regulated, mainly generic markets, such as Canada and Israel, branded generics-oriented markets, such as Russia and certain Latin America markets and hybrid markets, such as Japan. In February 2022, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, sustained conflict and disruption in the region is ongoing. Russia and Ukraine markets are included in our International Markets segment results and we have no manufacturing or R D facilities in these markets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the impact of this conflict on our International Markets segment s results of operations and financial condition was immaterial. Consistent with our foreign exchange risk management hedging programs, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we partially hedged our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our balance sheet assets, revenues and expenses. However, as of the end of the third quarter of 2024, we hedge a small part of our projected net revenues in Russian ruble for 2024. Prior to and since the escalation of the conflict, we have been taking measures to reduce our operational cash balances in Russia and Ukraine. We have been monitoring the solvency of our customers in Russia and Ukraine and have taken measures, where practicable, to mitigate our exposure to risks related to the conflict in the region. However, the duration, severity and global implications (including potential inflation and devaluation consequences) of the conflict cannot be predicted at this time and could have an effect on our business, including on our exchange rate exposure, supply chain, operational costs and commercial presence in these markets. Revenues from our International Markets segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 613 million, an increase of 4 compared to the third quarter of 2023. In local currency terms, revenues increased by 18 compared to the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to higher revenues from generic products in most markets, partially offset by regulatory price reductions and generic competition to off-patented products in Japan. Our higher revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were also partly driven by the sale of certain product rights. In the third quarter of 2024, revenues were negatively impacted by exchange rate fluctuations of 84 million, including hedging effects, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Revenues in the third quarter of 2024 included 1 million from a positive hedging impact, compared to a positive hedging impact of 7 million in the third quarter of 2023, which are included in Other in the table below. See note 8d to our consolidated financial statements.

Other revenues in the third quarter of 2024 include the sale of certain product rights. Generic products revenues (including OTC and biosimilar products) in our International Markets segment were 477 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 1 compared to the third quarter of 2023. In local currency terms, revenues increased by 13 compared to the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to higher revenues in most markets, largely driven by price increases as a result of higher costs due to inflationary pressure in certain markets and higher volumes, partially offset by regulatory price reductions and generic competition to off-patented products in Japan. AJOVY was launched in certain markets in our International Markets segment, including in Canada, Japan, Australia, Israel, South Korea, Brazil and others. AJOVY revenues in our International Markets segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 24 million, compared to 18 million in the third quarter of 2023, due to growth in existing markets in which AJOVY was launched. COPAXONE revenues in our International Markets segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 13 million compared to 16 million in the third quarter of 2023. AUSTEDO was launched in China and Israel in 2021 and in Brazil in 2022, for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington s disease and for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. In February 2024, we announced a strategic partnership for the marketing and distribution of AUSTEDO in China. We continue with additional submissions in various other markets. International Markets Gross Profit Gross profit from our International Markets segment in the third quarter of 2024 was 306 million, an increase of 4 compared to 293 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gross profit margin for our International Markets segment in the third quarter of 2024 increased to 49.9 , compared to 49.6 in the third quarter of 2023. This increase was mainly due to price increases largely as a result of inflationary pressures in certain markets, the sale of certain product rights and a favorable mix of products, partially offset by regulatory price reductions and generic competition to off-patented products in Japan, as well as higher costs due to inflationary and other macroeconomic pressures. International Markets R D Expenses R D expenses relating to our International Markets segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 27 million, a decrease of 11 compared to the third quarter of 2023. For a description of our R D expenses in the third quarter of 2024, see Teva Consolidated Results Research and Development (R D) Expenses below.

International Markets S M Expenses S M expenses relating to our International Markets segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 134 million, an increase of 16 compared to the third quarter of 2023, mainly to support revenue growth including through our strategic partnership in China for AUSTEDO. International Markets G A Expenses G A expenses relating to our International Markets segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 36 million, an increase of 10 compared to the third quarter of 2023. International Markets Other Income Other income in the third quarter of 2024 was minimal, compared to 2 million in the third quarter 2023. Other income in the third quarter of 2023 included a capital gain from the sale of assets. International Markets Profit Profit from our International Markets segment consists of gross profit less R D expenses, S M expenses, G A expenses and any other income related to this segment. Segment profit does not include amortization and certain other items. Profit from our International Markets segment in the third quarter of 2024 was 109 million, a decrease of 7 , compared to 117 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was mainly due to higher S M expenses in the third quarter of 2024. Other Activities We have other sources of revenues, primarily the sale of APIs to third parties, certain contract manufacturing services and an out-licensing platform offering a portfolio of products to other pharmaceutical companies through our affiliate Medis. Our other activities are not included in our United States, Europe or International Markets segments described above. On January 31, 2024, we announced that we intend to divest our API business (including its R D, manufacturing and commercial activities) through a sale, which divestment is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. The intention to divest is in alignment with our Pivot to Growth strategy. However, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing or structure of a potential divestiture or that a divestiture will be agreed or completed at all. Our revenues from other activities in the third quarter of 2024 were 229 million, an increase of 6 in U.S. dollars, or 5 in local currency terms, compared to the third quarter of 2023. API sales to third parties in the third quarter of 2024 were 130 million, reflecting an increase of 4 in both U.S. dollars and local currency terms, compared to the third quarter of 2023, following a reallocation of an immaterial business within our other activities, in line with our intention to divest our API business. Teva Consolidated Results The data presented with respect to other asset impairments, restructuring and other items, operating income (loss), income taxes, net income (loss) attributable to Teva and earnings (loss) per share for the prior period have been revised to reflect a revision in relation to a contingent consideration and related expenses in our consolidated financial statements. For additional information, see note 1c to our consolidated financial statements. Revenues Revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were 4,332 million, an increase of 13 in U.S. dollars, or 15 in local currency terms, compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase was mainly due to higher revenues from generic products in all our segments, from AUSTEDO in our United States segment, as well as from the sale of product rights in our Europe and International Markets segments. See United States Revenues, Europe Revenues, International Markets Revenues and Other Activities above. Exchange rate movements during the third quarter of 2024, including hedging effects, negatively impacted revenues by 88 million, compared to the third quarter of 2023. See note 8d to our consolidated financial statements.

Gross Profit Gross profit in the third quarter of 2024 was 2,148 million, an increase of 16 compared to 1,851 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gross profit margin was 49.6 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 48.1 in the third quarter of 2023. This increase was mainly due to a favorable mix of products, primarily AUSTEDO, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange rate movements including hedging effects. Research and Development (R D) Expenses, net Our R D activities for innovative medicines and biosimilar products in each of our segments include costs of discovery research, preclinical work, drug formulation, early- and late-stage clinical development and product registration costs. These expenditures are reported net of contributions received from collaboration partners. Our spending takes place throughout the development process, including (i) early-stage projects in both discovery and preclinical phases; (ii) middle-stage projects in clinical programs up to Phase 3; (iii) late-stage projects in Phase 3 programs, including where a new drug application is currently pending approval; (iv) post-approval studies for marketed products; and (v) indirect expenses, such as costs of internal administration, infrastructure and personnel. Our R D activities for generic products in each of our segments include both (i) direct expenses relating to product formulation, analytical method development, stability testing, management of bioequivalence and other clinical studies and regulatory filings; and (ii) indirect expenses, such as costs of internal administration, infrastructure and personnel. In the third quarter of 2024, our R D expenses related primarily to innovative product candidates and marketed products in immunology and immuno-oncology, neuroscience (such as neuropsychiatry, including post-approval commitments) and selected other areas, as well as generic products and biosimilars. R D expenses, net in the third quarter of 2024 were 240 million, a decrease of 5 compared to 253 million in the third quarter of 2023. Our lower R D expenses, net in the third quarter of 2024 were largely driven by reimbursements from our strategic partnerships (see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements), reflecting a decrease related to our late-stage innovative pipeline, partially offset by an increase in R D expenses relating to immunology projects. As we continue to execute on our Pivot to Growth strategy, we see higher R D spend in some of our late-stage innovative pipeline assets. R D expenses as a percentage of revenues were 5.5 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 6.6 in the third quarter of 2023.

Biosimilar Products Pipeline We have additional biosimilar products in development internally and with our partners that are in various stages of clinical trials and regulatory review worldwide, including Phase 3 clinical trials for biosimilars to Xgeva (denosumab) and Xolair (omalizumab), biosimilars to Eylea (afilbercept), Simponi , Simponi Aria (golimumab) and Entyvio (vedolizymab), which are in collaboration with Alvotech for the U.S. market, as well as our proposed biosimilar to Prolia (denosumab), which was submitted for regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe. Selling and Marketing (S M) Expenses S M expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were 626 million, an increase of 9 compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase was mainly a result of the factors discussed above under United States segment S M Expenses, Europe segment S M Expenses and International Markets Segment S M Expenses. S M expenses as a percentage of revenues were 14.5 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 15.0 in the third quarter of 2023. General and Administrative (G A) Expenses G A expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were 298 million, an increase of 11 compared to the third quarter of 2023. G A expenses as a percentage of revenues were 6.9 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 7.0 in the third quarter of 2023. Intangible Asset Impairments We recorded expenses of 28 million for identifiable intangible asset impairments in the third quarter of 2024, compared to expenses of 47 million in the third quarter of 2023. See note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Goodwill Impairment We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 600 million related to Teva s API reporting unit in the third quarter of 2024. No goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the third quarter of 2023. See note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. Other Asset Impairments, Restructuring and Other Items We recorded income of 23 million for other asset impairments, restructuring and other items in the third quarter of 2024, compared to expenses of 57 million in the third quarter of 2023. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Legal Settlements and Loss Contingencies We recorded expenses of 450 million in legal settlements and loss contingencies in the third quarter of 2024, compared to expenses of 314 million in the third quarter of 2023. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Other Income (Loss) Other income in the third quarter of 2024 was 21 million, compared to 9 million in the third quarter of 2023. Other income in the third quarter of 2024 included a capital gain from the sale of a business in our International Markets segment. Operating Income (Loss) Operating loss was 51 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to an operating income of 344 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was mainly due to a goodwill impairment charge and higher legal settlements and loss contingencies, partially offset by higher gross profit in the third quarter of 2024. Operating loss as a percentage of revenues was 1.2 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to an operating income as a percentage of revenues of 8.9 in the third quarter of 2023.

Diluted Shares Outstanding and Earnings (Loss) per Share The weighted average diluted shares outstanding used for the fully diluted share calculations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1,133 million shares and 1,135 million shares, respectively. Diluted loss per share was 0.39 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to diluted earnings per share of 0.06 in the third quarter of 2023. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Share Count for Market Capitalization We calculate share amounts using the outstanding number of shares (i.e., excluding treasury shares) plus shares that would be outstanding upon the exercise of options and vesting of RSUs and PSUs, and the conversion of our convertible senior debentures, in each case, at period end. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the fully diluted share count for purposes of calculating our market capitalization was approximately 1,167 million shares and 1,157 million shares, respectively. Impact of Currency Fluctuations on Results of Operations In the third quarter of 2024, approximately 45 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our results are reported in U.S. dollars, we are subject to significant foreign currency risks. Accordingly, changes in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and local currencies in the markets in which we operate (primarily the euro, British pound, Russian ruble, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Japanese yen and the new Israeli shekel) impact our results. During the third quarter of 2024, the following main currencies relevant to our operations decreased in value against the U.S. dollar (each compared on a quarterly average basis): Argentinian peso by 67 , Turkish lira by 20 , Brazilian real by 12 , Ukraine hryvna by 10 and Mexican peso by 10 . The following main currencies relevant to our operations increased in value against the U.S. dollar: Polish zloty by 6 , Russian ruble by 6 , Swedish krona by 4 and the euro by 1 . As a result, exchange rate movements during the third quarter of 2024, including hedging effects, negatively impacted overall revenues by 88 million and operating income by 57 million, compared to the third quarter of 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, a negative hedging impact of 9 million was recognized under revenues, and a positive hedging impact of 1 million was recognized under cost of sales. In the third quarter of 2023, a positive hedging impact of 22 million was recognized under revenues and a negative hedging impact of 7 million was recognized under cost of sales. Hedging transactions against future projected revenues and expenses are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value on a quarterly basis, while the foreign exchange impact on the underlying revenues and expenses may occur in subsequent quarters. See note 8d to our consolidated financial statements. Commencing in the third quarter of 2018, the cumulative inflation in Argentina exceeded 100 or more over a three-year period. Although this triggered highly inflationary accounting treatment, it did not have a material impact on our results of operations. Commencing in the second quarter of 2022, the cumulative inflation in Turkey exceeded 100 or more over a three-year period. Although this triggered highly inflationary accounting treatment, it did not have a material impact on our results of operations. Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Unless specified otherwise, the factors used to explain quarterly changes on a year-over-year basis are also relevant for the comparison of the results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Where there are different factors affecting the nine months comparison, we have described them below.

Other Activities We have other sources of revenues, primarily the sale of APIs to third parties, certain contract manufacturing services and an out-licensing platform offering a portfolio of products to other pharmaceutical companies through our affiliate Medis. Our other activities are not included in our United States, Europe or International Markets segments described above. On January 31, 2024, we announced that we intend to divest our API business (including its R D, manufacturing and commercial activities) through a sale, which divestment is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. The intention to divest is in alignment with our Pivot to Growth strategy. However, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing or structure of a potential divestiture or that a divestiture will be agreed or completed at all. Our revenues from other activities in the first nine months of 2024 were 703 million, an increase of 3 in both U.S. dollars and in local currency terms, compared to the first nine months of 2023. API sales to third parties in the first nine months of 2024 were 409 million, an increase of 4 in both U.S. dollars and local currency terms, compared to the first nine months of 2023, following a reallocation of an immaterial business within our other activities, in line with our intention to divest our API business.

The lower operating loss in the first nine months of 2024 was mainly due to higher gross profit and lower legal settlements and loss contingencies, partially offset by higher other asset impairments, restructuring and other items as well as higher goodwill impairment charges in the first nine months of 2024. Operating loss as a percentage of revenues was 2.2 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to an operating loss as a percentage of revenues of 2.8 in the first nine months of 2023.

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to non-controlling interests Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests was 262 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to a net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of 60 million in the first nine months of 2023. The higher net loss in the first nine months of 2024 was mainly due to higher impairments of tangible assets largely related to the classification of our business venture in Japan as held for sale. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Teva Net loss was 1,422 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to a net loss of 1,022 million in the first nine months of 2023. Diluted Shares Outstanding and Earnings (Loss) per Share The weighted average diluted shares outstanding used for the fully diluted share calculations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1,130 million shares and 1,119 million shares, respectively. Diluted loss per share was 1.26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to diluted loss per share of 0.91 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Impact of Currency Fluctuations on Results of Operations In the first nine months of 2024, approximately 47 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our results are reported in U.S. dollars, we are subject to significant foreign currency risks and, accordingly, changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and local currencies in markets in which we operate (primarily the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Russian ruble, Japanese yen and new Israeli shekel) impact our results. During the first nine months of 2024, the following main currencies relevant to our operations decreased in value against the U.S. dollar: Argentinian peso by 72 , Turkish lira by 31 , Chilean peso by 12 , Japanese yen by 9 and Russian ruble by 8 (all compared on a nine-month average basis). The following main currencies relevant to our operations increased in value against the U.S. dollar: Polish zloty by 7 , British pound by 3 , Swiss franc by 2 and Swedish krona by 1 . As a result, exchange rate movements during the first nine months of 2024, including hedging effects, negatively impacted overall revenues by 249 million and our operating income by 124 million, in comparison to the first nine months of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, a positive hedging impact of 1 million was recognized under revenues, and a negative hedging impact of 5 million was recognized under cost of sales. In the first nine months of 2023, a positive hedging impact of 20 million was recognized under revenues and a negative hedging impact of 8 was recognized under cost of sales. Hedging transactions against future projected revenues and expenses are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value on a quarterly basis, while the foreign exchange impact on the underlying revenues and expenses may occur in subsequent quarters. See note 8d to our consolidated financial statements. 2024 Aggregated Contractual Obligations There have not been any material changes in our assessment of material contractual obligations and commitments as set forth in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources Total balance sheet assets were 41,758 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 43,479 million as of December 31, 2023. Our working capital balance, which includes accounts receivables net of SR A, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payables, employee-related obligations, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, was negative 2,009 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to negative 1,374 million as of December 31, 2023. This decrease was mainly due to a classification of the working capital balance related to our business venture in Japan as held for sale (see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements), an increase in provisions for legal settlements and loss contingencies, and a negative impact from several tax items, primarily the agreement with the Israeli Tax Authorities entered into in June 2024 (see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements), partially offset by a decrease in accounts payables.

Table of Contents 

Employee-related obligations, as of September 30, 2024 were 619 million, compared to 611 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in the first nine months of 2024 was mainly due to an accrual for performance incentive payments to employees for 2024, partially offset by performance incentive payments to employees for 2023. Cash investment in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in the third quarter of 2024 was 148 million compared to 149 million in the third quarter of 2023. Depreciation in the third quarter of 2024 was 113 million, compared to 138 million in the third quarter of 2023. Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 were 3,319 million compared to 3,226 million as of December 31, 2023. Our cash on hand that is not used for ongoing operations is generally invested in bank deposits as well as liquid securities that bear fixed and floating rates. Teva s principal sources of short-term liquidity are its cash on hand, existing cash investments, liquid securities and available credit facilities, primarily our 1.8 billion unsecured syndicated sustainability-linked revolving credit facility, entered into in April 2022, as amended in February 2023 and on May 3, 2024 RCF ). See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Debt Balance and Movements As of September 30, 2024, our debt was 18,980 million, compared to 19,833 million as of December 31, 2023. This decrease was mainly due to repayment at maturity of 956 million of our 6 senior notes, partially offset by 88 million of exchange rate fluctuations. In April 2024, we repaid 956 million of our 6 senior notes at maturity. In October 2024, we repaid at maturity 685 million of our 1.13 senior notes due in 2024. As of September 30, 2024, our debt was effectively denominated in the following currencies: 58 in U.S. dollars, 40 in euros and 2 in Swiss francs. The portion of total debt classified as short-term as of September 30, 2024 was 14 compared to 8 as of December 31, 2023. Our financial leverage, which is the ratio between our debt and the sum of our debt and equity, was 75 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 71 as of December 31, 2023. Our average debt maturity was approximately 5.5 years as of September 30, 2024, compared to 6.0 years as of December 31, 2023. Total Equity Total equity was 6,383 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 8,126 million as of December 31, 2023. This decrease was mainly due to a net loss of 1,684 million, and a negative impact from exchange rate fluctuations of 94 million. Exchange rate fluctuations affected our balance sheet, as approximately 94 of our net assets as of September 30, 2024 (including both monetary and non-monetary assets) were in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. When compared to December 31, 2023, changes in currency rates as of September 30, 2024 had a negative impact of 94 million on our equity. The following main currencies increased in value against the U.S. dollar: British pound by 5 , Polish zloty by 3 and the euro by 1 . The following main currencies decreased in value against the U.S. dollar: Mexican peso by 16 , Russian ruble by 6 , Chilean peso by 2 , Canadian dollar by 2 and Japanese yen by 1 . All comparisons are on a year-to-date basis. Cash Flow We continually seek to improve the efficiency of our working capital management. Periodically, as part of our cash and commercial relationship management activities, we make decisions in our commercial and supply chain activities which may drive an acceleration of receivable payments from customers, or deceleration of payments to third parties. This has the effect of increasing or decreasing cash from operations during any given period. In connection with strategic continual improvement, we obtained more favorable payment terms from many of our vendors which are expected to continue in future periods. In addition, in periods in which receivable payments from customers are delayed, we have and expect we may in the future extend the time to pay certain vendors, so as to balance our liquidity position. Such decisions may have a material impact on our annual operating cash flow measurement, as well as on our quarterly results. 
 81 

Table of Contents 

Cash flow generated from operating activities during the third quarter of 2024 was 693 million, compared to 5 million of cash flow generated from operating activities in the third quarter of 2023. The higher cash flow generated from operating activities in the third quarter of 2024 resulted mainly from higher profit in our United States segment, as well as from changes in working capital items, including a positive impact from accounts receivables, net of SR A, and from accounts payables and inventory levels, partially offset by higher legal payments during the third quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, we generated free cash flow of 922 million, which we define as comprising 693 million in cash flow generated from operating activities, 339 million in beneficial interest collected in exchange for securitized accounts receivables (under our EU securitization program) and 38 million in divestitures of businesses and other assets, partially offset by 148 million in cash used for capital investment. During the third quarter of 2023, we generated free cash flow of 229 million, which we define as comprising 5 million in cash flow generated from operating activities, 362 million in beneficial interest collected in exchange for securitized accounts receivables (under our EU securitization program) and 10 million in proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets, partially offset by 149 million in cash used for capital investment. The increase in the third quarter of 2024, resulted mainly from higher cash flow generated from operating activities. Dividends We have not paid dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs since December 2017. Commitments In addition to financing obligations under short-term debt and long-term senior notes and loans, debentures and convertible debentures, our major contractual obligations and commercial commitments include leases, royalty payments, contingent payments pursuant to acquisition agreements, collaboration agreements, development funding agreements and participation in joint ventures associated with R D activities. For further information on our agreements with mAbxience, Launch Therapeutics and Abingworth, Biolojic Design, Royalty Pharma, Sanofi, Modag, Alvotech, Takeda and MedinCell, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We are committed to paying royalties to owners of know-how, partners in alliances and certain other arrangements, and to parties that financed R D at a wide range of rates as a percentage of sales of certain products, as defined in the agreements. In some cases, the royalty period is not defined; in other cases, royalties will be paid over various periods not exceeding 20 years. In connection with certain development, supply and marketing, and research and collaboration or services agreements, we are required to indemnify, in unspecified amounts, the parties to such agreements against third-party claims relating to (i) infringement or violation of intellectual property or other rights of such third party; or (ii) damages to users of the related products. Except as described in our financial statements, we are not aware of any material pending action that may result in the counterparties to these agreements claiming such indemnification. Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP EPS Data We present non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share EPS as management believes that such data provide useful information to investors because they are used by management and our Board of Directors, in conjunction with other performance metrics, to evaluate our operational performance, to prepare and evaluate our work plans and annual budgets and ultimately to evaluate the performance of management, including annual compensation. While other qualitative factors and judgment also affect annual compensation, the principal quantitative element in the determination of such compensation are performance targets tied to the work plan, which are based on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning and accordingly have limitations in their usefulness to investors. Investors are cautioned that, unlike financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, non-GAAP measures may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses our performance. The limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of our results of operations without including all events during a period and may not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the pharmaceutical industry. Investors should consider non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Table of Contents 

In preparing our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS data, we exclude items that either have a non-recurring impact on our financial performance or which, in the judgment of our management, are items that, either as a result of their nature or size, could, were they not excluded, potentially cause investors to extrapolate future performance from an improper base that is not reflective of our underlying business performance. Certain of these items are also excluded because of the difficulty in predicting their timing and scope. The items excluded from our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS include: 

amortization of purchased intangible assets; 

legal settlements and material litigation fees and/or loss contingencies, due to the difficulty in predicting their timing and scope; 

impairments of long-lived assets, including intangibles, property, plant and equipment and goodwill; 

restructuring expenses, including severance, retention costs, contract cancellation costs and certain accelerated depreciation expenses primarily related to the rationalization of our plants or to certain other strategic activities, such as the realignment of R D focus or other similar activities; 

acquisition- or divestment- related items, including changes in contingent consideration, integration costs, banker and other professional fees and inventory step-up; 

expenses related to our equity compensation; 

significant one-time financing costs, amortization of issuance costs and terminated derivative instruments, and marketable securities investment valuation gains/losses; 

unusual tax items; 

other awards or settlement amounts, either paid or received; 

other exceptional items that we believe are sufficiently large that their exclusion is important to facilitate an understanding of trends in our financial results, such as impacts due to significant costs for remediation of plants, or other unusual events; and 

corresponding tax effects of the foregoing items. The following tables present our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as well as reconciliations of each measure to their nearest GAAP equivalents:

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There has not been any material change in our assessment of market risk as set forth in Item 7A to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Teva maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in Teva s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Teva s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating these disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective. After evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, as of such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Previously Identified Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously disclosed, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which continues to exist as of September 30, 2024. We did not design and maintain effective control over the contingent consideration liability and related expenses in connection with estimated future royalty payments. This material weakness resulted in the misstatement of our Other asset impairments, restructuring and other items, Net income and Other taxes and long-term liabilities and related financial disclosures, and led to the revision of the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the interim financial information for the quarterly and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, December 31, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023. Additionally, this material weakness could result in a misstatement of the aforementioned account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

Table of Contents 

Remediation Plan Management has designed and implemented the following specific controls to address the material weakness and enhance our disclosure controls and procedures over the contingent consideration liability: (i) defined responsibilities over the end-to-end process; (ii) enhanced the formality and rigor of reconciliation procedures; and (iii) implemented additional monitoring controls through management reviews. In addition, management has conducted trainings for the related control owners. Although the new controls have been designed and implemented, they have not been operated for a sufficient period of time for management to conclude, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Accordingly, the material weakness described above is not remediated as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect Teva s internal control over financial reporting.
