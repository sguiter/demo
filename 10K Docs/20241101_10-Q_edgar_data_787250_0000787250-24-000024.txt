AES Ohio also provides retail SSO electric service to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers in a -square mile area of West Central Ohio. AES Ohio sources all of the generation for its SSO customers through a competitive bid process.

DPL Revenue 
 Retail customers, especially residential and commercial customers, consume more electricity on warmer and colder days. Therefore, our retail sales demand is affected by the number of heating and cooling degree-days occurring during a year. Cooling degree-days typically have a more significant effect than heating degree-days since some residential customers do not use electricity to heat their homes. Additionally, our retail revenue is affected by regulated rates and riders including the changes to our ESP described in Note 2. Regulatory Matters of our Form 10-K and Note 2. Regulatory Matters of DPL's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Heating degree-days 68 70 3,389 3,431 Cooling degree-days 691 684 1,003 992 
 
 (a) Heating and cooling degree-days are a measure of the relative heating or cooling required for a home or business. The heating degrees in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. For example, if the average temperature on March 20th was 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the heating degrees for that day would be the 25-degree difference between 65 degrees and 40 degrees. Similarly, cooling degrees in a day are calculated as the degrees that the average actual daily temperature is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 (b) 30-year average is computed from observed degree-days in the Dayton area on a trailing 30-year basis.

DPL Net Purchased Power 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net purchased power increased 17.1 million to 84.3 million compared to 67.2 million in the same period of the prior year, and, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net purchased power decreased 33.4 million to 243.5 million compared to 276.9 million in the same period of the prior year. These changes were primarily the result of changes in the cost of purchased power shown below. 
 Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, in millions 2024 vs. 2023 2024 vs. 2023 Net purchased power Purchased power Rate Decrease primarily due to lower prices in the competitive bid process, partially offset by higher amortization of previously deferred purchased power costs being recovered through customer rates (2.8) (7.0) Increase due to prior year deferral of purchased power costs associated with the approval of ESP 4 28.9 28.9 Volume Decrease in demand primarily due to lower retail SSO load served due to fewer SSO customers (21.2) (75.6) Total purchased power change 4.9 (53.7) RTO charges Increase primarily due to increase in TCRR rates 12.2 20.3 Net change in purchased power 17.1 (33.4) 
 
 DPL Operation and Maintenance 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Operation and maintenance expense increased 10.3 million and 18.2 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The main drivers of these changes are as follows: 
 Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, in millions 2024 vs. 2023 2024 vs. 2023 Increase in charges from Service Company 
 5.4 11.3 Increase in contracted services

 1.8 5.4 Increase in vegetation management (a) 
 1.0 3.9 Increase from collection of deferred uncollectible expense (a) 
 1.0 3.7 Decrease in USF rider (a) 
 (5.8) (15.3) Other 1.8 (0.1) Net change in operation and maintenance expense 10.3 18.2 
 
 (a) There is a corresponding offset in Revenue associated with these costs and minimal operating margin impact. 
 
 DPL Depreciation and Amortization 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Depreciation and amortization increased 5.1 million and 8.5 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to additional assets placed in service. 
 
 DPL Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Taxes other than income taxes increased 2.9 million and 7.0 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of higher property taxes due to higher assessed values in the current year. 
 
 DPL Interest Expense, Net 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Interest expense, net increased 13.3 and 17.0, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the prior year 
 49 

deferral of carrying costs associated with the approval of ESP 4, as well as new debt issuances at AES Ohio, partially offset by an increase in AFUDC debt. 
 
 DPL Income Tax Expense / (Benefit) 
 Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, in millions 2024 2023 change change 2024 2023 change change Income tax expense / (benefit) (7.5) 9.6 (17.1) (178) (4.6) 5.3 (9.9) (187) 
 
 The decreases in income tax expense / (benefit) of (17.1) million and (9.9) million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year were primarily driven by higher pre-tax income in the prior year, and an increase in the net tax benefit related to the reversal of excess deferred taxes of AES Ohio. 
 
 See Note 6. Income Taxes in the DPL's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT - DPL 
 
 DPL manages its business through one reportable operating segment, the Utility segment. The primary segment performance measure is income / (loss) before income tax as management has concluded that this measure best reflects the underlying business performance of DPL and is the most relevant measure considered in DPL s internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segment. The Utility segment is comprised of AES Ohio, a public electric transmission and distribution utility, with all other nonutility business activities aggregated separately. See Note 1. Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of DPL's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on AES Ohio. The Other nonutility category primarily includes interest expense, cash and other immaterial balances. The accounting policies of the identified segment are consistent with those policies and procedures described in the summary of significant accounting policies. 
 
 See PART I, ITEM 1., Note 10. Business Segments of DPL's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding DPL s reportable segment.

 Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, in millions 2024 2023 change change 2024 2023 change change Income tax expense / (benefit) (1.9) 11.5 (13.4) (117) 4.2 11.3 (7.1) (63) 
 
 The decreases in income tax expense / (benefit) of (13.4) million and (7.1) million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year were primarily driven by higher pre-tax income in the prior year, and an increase in the net tax benefit related to the reversal of excess deferred taxes. 
 
 See Note 5. Income Taxes of AES Ohio's Condensed Financial Statements for further discussion . 

KEY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
 
 During 2024 and beyond, we expect our financial results will be primarily impacted by retail demand and weather. In addition, DPL's and AES Ohio's financial results are likely to be driven by other factors including, but not limited to: 
 
 regulatory outcomes; 
 the passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations or other changes in regulation; and 
 the timely recovery of transmission and distribution expenditures. 
 
 If favorable outcomes related to these factors do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, then these factors, or other factors unknown to us, may impact our operating income, net income and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For a discussion of the risks related to our business, see Item 1. Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Form 10-K. 
 
 Operational 
 Capital Projects Our construction projects have experienced some indications of delays and price increases due to supply chain disruptions; however, they are currently proceeding without material delays. For further discussion of our capital requirements, see PART I, ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Macroeconomic and Political 
 U.S. Income Tax The macroeconomic and political environments in the U.S. have changed in recent years. This could result in significant impacts to tax law. 
 
 Inflation In the markets in which we operate, there have been higher rates of inflation recently. If inflation increases in our market, it may increase our expenses that we may not be able to pass through to customers. AES Ohio may have the ability to recover operations and maintenance costs through the regulatory process; however, timing impacts on recovery may vary. In addition, the SSO auction process has reflected current macroeconomic conditions in terms of pricing. 
 
 Interest Rates In the U.S. there has been a rise in interest rates since 2021, and interest rates are expected to remain volatile in the near term. Although all of our existing DPL and AES Ohio long-term debt is at fixed rates, an increase in interest rates can have several impacts on our business. For our existing short-term debt under floating rate structures and any future debt refinancings or future new money financings, rising interest rates will increase future financing costs. Our floating rate debt is currently limited to short-term borrowings under the AES Ohio Credit Agreement. For future debt financings, DPL manages a hedging program to help reduce uncertainty and exposure to future interest rates. 
 
 Regulatory 
 DPL s, AES Ohio s and our other subsidiaries facilities and operations are subject to a wide range of regulations and laws by federal, state and local authorities. As well as imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws 
 54 

and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. In the normal course of business, we have investigatory and remedial activities underway at these facilities and operations in an effort to comply, or to determine compliance, with such regulations. We record liabilities for losses that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition to matters discussed or updated herein, our 2023 Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q previously filed with the SEC during 2024 describe other regulatory matters, which have not materially changed since those filings. 
 
 Smart Grid Phase 2 Plan - In February 2024, AES Ohio filed a Smart Grid Phase 2 with the PUCO proposing to invest approximately 683 million in capital projects over a 10-year period following Smart Grid Phase 1, which ends June 2025. On September 13, 2024, AES Ohio reached a settlement with the PUCO Staff and other parties on the pending Smart Grid Phase 2 Application. The Settlement will provide for a four-year plan to invest 240.5 million of capital and 18.6 million of operations and maintenance expense related to grid modernization, support of Distributed Energy Resources and Economic Development and an enhanced Telecommunications network. These costs will be recovered through the existing Investment Infrastructure Rider. If approved, AES Ohio will implement a comprehensive grid modernization project that will deliver benefits to customers, society as a whole and to AES Ohio. An evidentiary hearing was held on October 29, 2024, and we expect an order from the PUCO by the second quarter of 2025, prior to the end of Smart Grid Phase 1. 
 
 Distribution Rate Case - On October 30, 2024, AES Ohio filed a Pre-filing Notice of Intent to file an application to increase rates for distribution service. The Distribution Rate Case Application will be filed on November 29, 2024. 
 
 See PART I, ITEM 1., Note 2. Regulatory Matters of DPL's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and PART I, ITEM 1., Note 2. Regulatory Matters of AES Ohio's Condensed Financial Statements for further information regarding these and other regulatory matters. 
 
 Environmental 
 We have several pending environmental matters associated with our previously-owned stations. Some of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 As a result of DPL now not directly owning or operating any generating stations, the following environmental matters, regulations and requirements are now not expected to have a material impact on DPL: 
 MATS and any associated regulatory or judicial processes; 
 NAAQS; and 
 recently finalized CAA Section 111(d) regulations for greenhouse gases from existing electric generating units. 
 
 Regulation of CCR 
 
 On October 19, 2015, an EPA rule regulating CCR under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as 
 nonhazardous solid waste became effective ("CCR Rule"). The rule established nationally applicable minimum 
 criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currently operating landfills and surface impoundments, including 
 location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action and closure 
 requirements and post-closure care. The 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act ("WIIN Act"), 
 includes provisions to implement the CCR Rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to 
 participate, a possible federal permit program. The EPA has indicated that they will implement a phased approach to 
 amending the CCR Rule. 
 
 On May 8, 2024, the EPA published final revisions to the CCR Rule, which are effective on November 8, 2024. The final revisions expand the scope of CCR units regulated by the CCR rule to include legacy surface impoundments, inactive surface impoundments, and CCR management units. 
 
 The CCR Rule, current or proposed amendments to, or EPA interpretations of, the CCR Rule, the results of 
 groundwater monitoring data or the outcome of CCR-related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our 
 results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 DPL and AES Ohio had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 41.0 million and 19.6 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. At that date, neither DPL nor AES Ohio had short-term investments. DPL and AES Ohio had aggregate principal amounts of long-term debt outstanding of 1,852.3 million and 1,021.7 million, respectively. 
 
 From time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management believes such repurchases are favorable to make. The amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material. 
 
 We depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage our liquidity needs. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in regulatory determinations could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses. 
 
 During the nine months ended, DPL received 200.0 million in equity contributions from AES. DPL then made the same investments in AES Ohio. The proceeds from these equity contributions allow AES Ohio to seek to improve its infrastructure and modernize its grid while maintaining liquidity. 
 
 CASH FLOWS 
 DPL s financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements include the consolidated results of its principal subsidiary AES Ohio. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 Cash Flow Analysis - DPL 
 
 The following table summarizes the cash flows of DPL: 
 Nine months ended September 30, in millions 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 93.6 16.9 Net cash used in investing activities (473.4) (301.8) Net cash provided by financing activities 379.8 303.7 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 18.8 Balance at beginning of period 41.1 30.6 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period 41.1 49.4 
 
 The following cash flow review compares the cash flows of DPL for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 DPL Operating activities 
 Nine months ended September 30, change in millions 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 Net income 23.1 34.6 (11.5) Depreciation and amortization 69.4 60.9 8.5 Deferred income taxes 11.6 20.9 (9.3) Other adjustments to net income (1.5) (0.9) (0.6) Net income, adjusted for non-cash items 102.6 115.5 (12.9) Net change in operating assets and liabilities and other (9.0) (98.6) 89.6 Net cash provided by operating activities 93.6 16.9 76.7 
 
 56 

The net change in operating assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by the following: 
 in millions Change Increase from accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments 60.2 Increase from current and non-current regulatory assets and liabilities primarily due to an increase in collections from customers and the prior year deferral of purchased power costs and additional carrying costs associated with the approval of ESP 4 
 60.2 Increase from taxes applicable to subsequent years driven by changes in property taxes 
 16.8 Decrease from accrued taxes payable / receivable primarily due to tax payments of 21.0 million from AES in the prior year and changes in income tax expense / (benefit) 
 (44.6) Other (3.0) Net change in operating assets and liabilities and other 89.6 
 
 DPL Investing activities

 DPL Financing activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased 76.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the following: 
 in millions Change Increase due to short-term borrowings 150.0 Increase due to higher net borrowings on revolving credit facilities 65.0 Decrease due to lower issuances of long-term debt at AES Ohio (100.0) Decrease due to lower equity contributions from parent in the current year (39.0) Other 0.1 Net change in financing activities 76.1

AES Ohio Operating activities 
 Nine months ended September 30, change in millions 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 Net income 37.0 52.8 (15.8) Depreciation and amortization 68.0 59.9 8.1 Deferred income taxes 4.2 11.3 (7.1) Other adjustments to net income (3.2) (2.5) (0.7) Net income, adjusted for non-cash items 106.0 121.5 (15.5) Net change in operating assets and liabilities and other 11.5 (103.7) 115.2 Net cash provided by operating activities 117.5 17.8 99.7 
 
 The net change in operating assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by the following: 
 in millions Change Increase from accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments 60.0 Increase from current and non-current regulatory assets and liabilities primarily due to an increase in collections from customers and the prior year deferral of purchased power costs and additional carrying costs associated with the approval of ESP 4 60.2 Other (5.0) Net change in operating assets and liabilities and other 115.2 
 
 AES Ohio Investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 173.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the following:

 in millions Change Increase due to short-term borrowings 150.0 Increase due to lower distributions to DPL in the current year 44.0 Increase due to higher net borrowings on revolving credit facilities 30.0 Decrease due to lower issuances of long-term debt at AES Ohio (100.0) Decrease due to lower equity contributions from DPL in the current year (60.0) Other 0.1 Net change in financing activities 64.1 
 
 LIQUIDITY 
 We expect our existing cash balances, cash generated from operating activities and borrowing capacity on our existing credit facilities will be adequate to meet our anticipated operating needs, including interest expense on our debt and any dividends to our equity owners. Our business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and carrying costs, taxes and any dividend payments. For 2024 and subsequent years, we expect to satisfy these requirements with a combination of cash from operations, funds from debt financing and funds from equity capital contributions as our internal liquidity needs and market conditions warrant. We also expect that the borrowing capacity under the AES Ohio Credit Agreement will continue to be available to manage working capital requirements during those periods. The absence of adequate liquidity could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

At September 30, 2024, AES Ohio has access to the following revolving credit facility: 
 in millions Type Maturity Commitment Amounts available as of September 30, 2024 AES Ohio Credit Agreement Revolving December 2027 250.0 205.0 
 
 For the AES Ohio Credit Agreement, as of September 30, 2024, there were 45.0 million in borrowings under the facility, with the remaining 205.0 million available to AES Ohio. For more information on the AES Ohio Credit Agreement, see Note 5. Debt of our Form 10-K. 
 
 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAM 
 Our capital expenditure program, including development and permitting costs, for the three-year period from 2024 through 2026 is currently estimated to cost up to 1.3 billion, and includes estimates as follows: 
 in millions 2024 2025 2026 For the three-year period from 2024 through 2026 Distribution-related additions, improvements and extensions 166.0 217.0 185.0 568.0 Transmission-related additions and improvements 168.0 193.0 151.0 512.0 Smart Grid Phase 1 improvements and additions 89.0 14.0 103.0 Other 61.0 10.0 9.0 80.0 Total for AES Ohio 484.0 434.0 345.0 1,263.0 Other subsidiaries 3.0 6.0 5.0 14.0 Total for DPL 487.0 440.0 350.0 1,277.0 
 
 AES Ohio's projection includes expected spending under its Smart Grid Phase 1 included in the comprehensive settlement approved by the PUCO on June 16, 2021, as well as new transmission and distribution projects. AES Ohio s spending programs are contingent on, among other events, successful regulatory outcomes in pending proceedings. See more information in Note 2. Regulatory Matters of DPL's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and AES Ohio's Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 AES Ohio is subject to the mandatory reliability standards of NERC and ReliabilityFirst Corporation, one of the six NERC regions, of which AES Ohio is a member. Anticipated costs related to these standards are included in the overall capital projections above.

 We cannot predict whether the current debt and credit ratings of DPL or the debt and credit ratings of AES Ohio will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn 
 59 

entirely by a rating agency. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. If the rating agencies were to reduce our debt or credit ratings, our borrowing costs may increase, our potential pool of investors and funding resources may be reduced, and we may be required to post additional collateral under selected contracts. These events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, any such reduction in our debt or credit ratings may adversely affect the trading price of our outstanding debt securities. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 For information on guarantees, commercial commitments, and contractual obligations, see PART I, ITEM 1., Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies of DPL's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and PART I, ITEM 1., Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies of AES Ohio's Condensed Financial Statements. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 DPL s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and AES Ohio s Condensed Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of these financial statements, our management is required to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities. These assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Our critical accounting estimates are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain. 
 
 Different estimates could have a material effect on our financial results. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or circumstances. Historically, however, recorded estimates have not differed materially from actual results. Significant items subject to such judgments include: the carrying value of property, plant and equipment; unbilled revenue; the valuation of insurance and claims liabilities; the valuation of allowances for credit losses and deferred income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; liabilities recorded for income tax exposures; litigation; contingencies; assets and liabilities related to employee benefits and intangible assets. Refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a complete listing of our critical accounting policies and estimates. We have reviewed and determined that these remain as critical accounting policies as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no material changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as previously disclosed in our Form 10-K. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 DPL and AES Ohio, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 We periodically review our internal controls over financial reporting as part of our efforts to ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, we routinely review our system of internal controls over financial reporting to identify potential changes to our processes and systems that may improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal controls environment. During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, we implemented SAP IS-U, a software solution that SAP 
 60 

developed for businesses operating in the utility industries, which involved changes to related processes that are part of our system of internal controls over financial reporting and require testing for effectiveness. 
 
 Other than the system and related process changes described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

61 

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 In the normal course of business, we are subject to various lawsuits, actions, claims, and other proceedings. We are also, from time to time, involved in other reviews, investigations and proceedings by governmental and regulatory agencies regarding our business, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. We have accrued in our Financial Statements for litigation and claims where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe the amounts provided in our Financial Statements, as prescribed by GAAP, for these matters are adequate considering the probable and estimable contingencies. However, there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from various legal proceedings, claims and other matters (including those matters noted below), and to comply with applicable laws and regulations will not exceed the amounts reflected in our Financial Statements. As such, costs, if any, that may be incurred in excess of those amounts provided for in our Financial Statements, cannot be reasonably determined, but could be material. 
 
 Our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, and June 30, 2024, and the Notes to DPL s Consolidated Financial Statements and AES Ohio s Financial Statements included therein, contain descriptions of certain legal proceedings in which we are or were involved. The information in or incorporated by reference into this Item 1 to Part II is limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings and new legal proceedings, since the filing of such Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and should be read in conjunction with such Forms 10-K and 10-Q.

 46 

Buyer and Seller cannot reach agreement on such amount within thirty (30) days after the date of such Order, then Buyer and Seller shall escalate the matter to, with respect to Buyer, its executive vice president, and, with respect to Seller, its chief executive officer, in each case, of their respective ultimate parent entities for negotiation provided , further , that if the foregoing persons cannot reach agreement on such amount within thirty (30) days of the referral thereto, the matter shall be referred to a Qualified Valuation Arbiter selected in the manner set forth in Section 10.4(c)(iv) , who shall determine the Losses to the Buyer Indemnified Parties resulting from such Order in accordance with the procedures and terms of Section 10.4(c)(iv) , which Losses shall be paid quarterly in the manner contemplated by Section 10.4(c)(iii) .

The exercise of the Put Right shall be in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in the Newco II Shareholders Agreement, and the terms of Section 2.15 of the Newco II Shareholders Agreement are incorporated herein mutatis mutandis .

If Buyer s Proportionate Share of such Tax Refund received by the Company or any of its Affiliates exceeds the amount of the indemnity already paid to Buyer under this Article X (an Excess Tax Refund Amount ), the Excess Tax Refund Amount shall offset and reduce any future subsequent indemnity payments to be made by Seller under this Article X .
