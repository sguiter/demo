Fair Value Measurement Authoritative accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held certain investment assets and certain liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These investments include money market funds and marketable equity securities where fair value is determined using quoted prices in active markets. Accordingly, the fair value measurements of these investments have been classified as Level 1 in the tables below. Investments for which we elected net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value and investments measured using the fair value measurement alternative are excluded from the tables below. Fair value for deferred compensation liabilities that are credited with deemed gains or losses of the underlying hypothetical investments, primarily equity securities, have been classified as Level 1 in the tables below.

The investments in private equity funds represent underlying investments in domestic and international markets across various industry sectors. Generally, our investments in private equity funds are non-transferable or are subject to long holding periods, and withdrawals from the private equity firm partnerships are typically not permitted. The maximum risk of loss related to our private equity fund investments is limited to the carrying value of its investments in the entities.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received a distribution of million from our unconsolidated affiliate, Orbit Private Investments L.P. which reduced our investment in the affiliate. We recorded the distribution as a million operating cash inflow and a million investing cash inflow in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to the nature of the distribution. 

million in cash, plus the costs of effecting the transaction. We financed the acquisition in part by entering into an Incremental Joinder to our existing amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of April 16, 2018 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement ). Battea is a market-leading provider of securities class action claims and settlement recovery services. The net assets and results of operations of Battea have been included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from September 27, 2024. The fair value of the acquired receivables represents the contractual value net of the allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts. The preliminary fair value of the intangible assets, consisting of customer relationships, completed technologies and trade names, was determined using the income approach. The intangible assets will be amortized each year based on the ratio that the projected cash flows for the intangible assets bear to the total of current and expected future cash flows for the intangible assets. The customer relationships, completed technologies and trade names are expected to be amortized over approximately thirteen , eleven and , respectively, in each case the estimated life of the assets. The remainder of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill which is attributed to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. A portion of goodwill is tax deductible. There are million in revenues from Battea s operations included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income from the date of acquisition through September 30, 2024.

The Term B-8 Loans bear interest at, at our option, Also on May 9, 2024, we issued million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due (the 6.5 Senior Notes ). The net proceeds of the Term B-8 Loans and from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay all amounts owed under the term B-3 loans, the term B-4 loans, the term B-5 loans, the term B-6 loans and the term B-7 loans (together, the Existing Term Loans under the Credit Agreement, as well as to pay related fees and expenses. On September 27, 2024, in connection with our acquisition of Battea, we entered into an Incremental Joinder to our Credit Agreement (the September 2024 Incremental Joinder ). Pursuant to the September 2024 Incremental Joinder, we borrowed million in aggregate principal amount of incremental term A-9 loans Term A-9 Loans ), the net proceeds of which were used to finance in part the acquisition of Battea, the payment of fees and expenses related thereto and for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Term A-9 Loans bear interest at, at our option, two leverage-based adjustments that increase the interest rate margin by per annum if our consolidated net secured leverage ratio is greater than 3.50x and 4.25x, respectively, and one leverage-based adjustment that reduces the interest rate margin by per annum if our consolidated net secured leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50x. Debt issuance costs and loss on extinguishment of debt We evaluated the borrowing of our Term B-8 Loans and issuance of Senior Notes and the repayment of our Existing Term Loans in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments . We determined that the new debt borrowing and issuance and existing debt repayment were two independent transactions due to the fact that (i) no single investor held a significant concentration of both the old and the new debt, (ii) none of the old investors were included in negotiations with creditors about modifying the old debt, and (iii) all lenders were provided the same opportunity to participate in the new debt regardless of whether they were an existing lender. Consequently, the refinancing was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. As a result, the Existing Term Loans borrowing costs of million were expensed and are included in Loss on extinguishment of debt in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In connection with the May 2024 and September 2024 debt transactions, we capitalized an aggregate of million and mil lion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, in financing costs, which represent new third-party costs.

In July 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which enables us to repurchase up to billion in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions until the one-year anniversary of the Board s authorization, unless earlier terminated by the Board. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we repurchased million and million shares, respectively, of common stock for approximately million and million, respectively, which includes a 1 excise tax on stock repurchases. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we repurchased million and million shares, respectively, of common stock for approximately million and million, respectively, which includes a 1 excise tax on stock repurchases.

that require monthly or quarterly payments and are subject to automatic annual renewal at the end of the initial term unless terminated by either party. We also generate revenues by licensing our software to clients through either perpetual or term licenses and by selling maintenance services. We classify license revenues related to sales-based royalty arrangements as term license revenue. Maintenance services are generally provided under annually renewable contracts. Our pricing typically scales as a function of our clients assets under management, the complexity of asset classes managed, the volume of transactions and the level of service the client requires. Revenues from professional services consist mostly of services provided on a time and materials basis. Deferred revenues primarily represent unrecognized fees billed or collected for maintenance and professional services. Deferred revenues are recognized as (or when) we perform under the contract. Deferred revenues are recorded on a net basis with contract assets at the contract level. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , approximately million and million, respectively, of deferred revenue is presented net within contract assets arising from the same contracts. The amount of revenues recognized in the period that was included in the opening deferred revenues balance was million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 	As of September 30, 2024, revenue of approximately million is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for license, maintenance and related revenues, of which million is expected to be recognized over the next twelve months. We record revenue net of any taxes assessed by governmental authorities. Revenue Disaggregation

The stock-based compensation expense related to performance awards is adjusted for changes in our assessment of the performance target level that is probable of being achieved and the number of performance-based equity awards expected to vest. In December 2021, we granted performance-based stock options PSOs for which the 3-year performance period ends in December 2024. If the threshold level of performance is not achieved for these PSOs, million of previously recorded stock-based compensation expense will be reversed.

and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily related to a proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, partially offset by an increased recognition of windfall tax benefits from stock awards in the current year. The change in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily related to releases of uncertain tax positions in the current year due to closed audits, an increased recognition of windfall tax benefits from stock awards in the current year and a proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include tax benefits of million and million, respectively, related to releases of uncertain tax positions and million and million, respectively, of tax refunds, due to closed audits and statute of limitations expirations.

Item 2. 	Management s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD A, is intended to provide readers of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements with the perspectives of management. It presents, in narrative form, information regarding our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. It should be read in conjunction with our 2023 Form 10-K and the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q. We use the term organic to refer to the businesses and operations that are included in the comparable prior year period on a constant currency basis. Organic excludes the impact of any business which we acquired for the time period which would impact the comparable prior year period. 
 Ongoing macroeconomic conditions, such as increases in interest rates, inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could have impacts on our results that are uncertain and, in many respects, outside our control. The situations remain dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change, which ultimately could result in material negative effects on our business and results of operations. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the potential impacts to our business, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by our management, and such judgments are reflected in the amounts reported in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In applying these policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, management s observation of trends in the industry, information provided by our clients and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Actual results may differ significantly from the estimates contained in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates and assumptions or the judgments affecting the application of those estimates and assumptions since the filing of our 2023 Form 10-K. Our critical accounting policies are described in the 2023 Form 10-K and include:

 Revenues 
 We derive our revenues from two sources: software-enabled services revenues and license, maintenance and related revenues. As a general matter, fluctuations in our software-enabled services revenues are attributable to the number of new software-enabled services clients as well as total assets under management in our clients portfolios and the number of outsourced transactions provided to our existing clients. Software-enabled services revenues also fluctuate as a result of reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses, such as postage and telecommunications charges, which are recorded as revenues on an accrual basis. Because these additional revenues are offset by the reimbursable expenses incurred, there is no impact on gross profit, operating income and net income, however the reimbursements billed and expenses incurred can lead to fluctuations in revenues, cost of revenues and gross margin percentage each period. License, maintenance and related revenues consist primarily of term and perpetual license fees, maintenance fees and professional services. Maintenance revenues vary based on customer retention and on the annual increases in fees, which are generally tied to the consumer price index. License and professional services revenues tend to fluctuate based on the number of new licensing clients, the timing and terms of contract renewals and demand for consulting services. 
 Our results of operations below include the results of our recent acquisition from the date which it was acquired. The Iress Managed Funds Administration Business 2023 acquisition was acquired in October 2023 and Battea-Class Action Services, LLC Battea was acquired in September 2024.

 Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for Interest, Taxes and Other 
 Interest expense, net . Net interest expense totaled 109.6 million and 338.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 120.6 million and 350.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in interest expense, net for 2024 as compared to 2023, for the three months ended is primarily due to lower average debt balances. The decrease in interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to lower average debt balances, partially offset by slightly higher average interest rates. We had an average interest rate of 6.78 and 6.81 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 6.87 and 6.56 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Other income (expense), net . Other income (expense), net was 9.3 million and 16.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to (5.0) million and 15.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income (expense), net consisted primarily of foreign currency translation gains of 4.2 million, investment gains due to mark-to market adjustments of 3.1 million and dividend income of 2.2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income (expense), net consisted primarily of dividend income of 14.8 million and investment gains due to mark-to-market adjustments of 2.5 million, partially offset by foreign currency translation losses of 1.6 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, other (expense) income, net included investment losses due to mark-to-market adjustments of 2.7 million and 0.9 million, respectively, and foreign currency translation losses of 2.5 million and 3.7 million, respectively, as well as dividend income of 2.3 million and 14.6 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, other income also included income of 13.4 million from the settlement of a dispute related to pre-acquisition matters and losses of 7.3 million related to the fair value adjustments on assets held for sale.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net totaled 1.1 million and 20.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 27.5 million and 42.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net in 2024 included a 17.1 million adjustment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to increase the carrying value of one of our investments. Our equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net in 2023 included a 26.4 million and 38.8 million adjustment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, to increase the carrying value of one of our investments. 
 Provision for income taxes . The following table sets forth the provision for income taxes (dollars in millions) and effective tax rates for the periods indicated:

Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differ from the statutory rate of 21.0 primarily due to the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, foreign income that is being taxed in the U.S. offset by foreign tax credits that are being limited and the recognition of windfall tax benefits from stock awards. Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include benefits of 1.1 million and 41.9 million, respectively, related to releases of uncertain tax positions and 1.5 million and 7.2 million, respectively, of tax refunds, due to closed audits and statute of limitations expirations. The change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily related to a proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, partially offset by an increased recognition of windfall tax benefits from stock awards in the current year. The change in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily related to releases of uncertain tax positions in the current year due to closed audits, an increased recognition of windfall tax benefits from stock awards in the current year and a proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions. While we have income from multiple foreign sources, the majority of our non-U.S. operations are in the United Kingdom and India. We anticipate the statutory tax rates in 2024 to be 25.0 in the United Kingdom and approximately 25.4 in India. A future change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate. 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, which includes a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax and a 1 excise tax on stock repurchases. The provisions were effective January 1, 2023 and were immaterial to our financial results, financial position and cash flows. The 1 excise tax on stock repurchases is included as a cost to acquire treasury stock. 
 In 2021, the OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development )/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting released Model Global Anti-Base Erosion rules under Pillar Two. Further guidance has been released throughout 2022 and 2023. Certain aspects of Pillar Two are effective January 1, 2024 and other aspects are effective January 1, 2025. Many non-U.S. tax jurisdictions in which we operate have either recently enacted legislation or are in the process of enacting legislation to adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in 2024 or in future years. We do not expect the provisions effective in 2024 to materially impact our financial results, financial position and cash flows. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal cash requirements are to finance the costs of our operations pending the billing and collection of client receivables, to fund payments with respect to our indebtedness, to invest in research and development, to acquire complementary businesses or assets, to repurchase shares of our common stock and to pay dividends on our common stock. We expect our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and cash available under our Credit Agreement to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements and capital spending for at least the next twelve months. 
 We paid quarterly cash dividends of 0.24 per share of common stock in each of March 2024 and June 2024 and 0.25 per share of common stock in September 2024 totaling 182.6 million in the aggregate. We paid quarterly cash dividends of 0.20 per share of common stock in each of March 2023 and June 2023 and 0.24 per share of common stock in September 2023 totaling 160.9 million in the aggregate. 
 Client funds obligations include our transfer agency client balances invested overnight as well as our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us. Our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client obligations are primarily sourced by funds held on behalf of clients. We had 2,081.5 million of client funds obligations at September 30, 2024.

Net cash provided by operating activities was 902.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from net income of 513.3 million adjusted for non-cash items of 640.0 million, partially offset by changes in our working capital accounts totaling 251.3 million. The changes in our working capital accounts were driven by an increase in accounts receivable, decreases in accrued expenses, a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in contract assets. 
 Investing activities used net cash of 802.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to 646.9 million paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired and asset acquisitions, 149.7 million in capitalized software development costs and 41.7 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by 24.4 million in distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates, the collection of other non-current receivables of 7.7 million and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 3.3 million. 
 Financing activities used net cash of 790.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily representing a net decrease in client fund obligations of 952.2 million, 369.3 million of purchases of common stock for treasury, 182.6 million in quarterly dividends paid, 36.6 million in payments of deferred financing fees and 20.3 million in withholding taxes paid related to equity award net share settlements. These expenditures were partially offset by net borrowings of 484.9 million, proceeds of 271.1 million from stock option exercises and proceeds from noncontrolling interests of 14.9 million. 
 We have made a permanent reinvestment determination in certain non-U.S. operations that have historically generated positive operating cash flows. At September 30, 2024, we held approximately 251.9 million in cash and cash equivalents at non-U.S. subsidiaries where we had made such a determination and in turn no provision for income taxes had been made.

 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

The senior secured credit facility has a revolving credit facility available for borrowings by SS C with 600.0 million in available commitments Revolving Credit Facility ), of which 596.9 million was available as of September 30, 2024. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains a 75.0 million letter of credit sub-facility, of which 3.1 million was utilized as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 May 2024 Debt Refinancing 
 On May 9, 2024, we entered into the Incremental Joinder First Amendment to Credit Agreement (the Amendment ), which amended our existing amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of April 16, 2018 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement ). Pursuant to the Amendment, we borrowed 3,935.0 million in aggregate principal amount of incremental term B-8 loans (the Term B-8 Loans ). The Term B-8 Loans bear interest at, at our option, the Base Rate (as defined in the Amendment), plus 1.00 per annum, or the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Amendment), plus 2.00 per annum. 
 Also on May 9, 2024, we issued 750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5 Senior Notes due 2032 (the 6.5 Senior Notes ). The 6.5 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. The 6.5 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by SS C Holdings and all of its existing domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than SS C Technologies) that guarantee our existing senior secured credit facilities and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our existing senior secured credit facilities and certain other indebtedness. Interest on the 6.5 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024. 
 The net proceeds of the Term B-8 Loans and from the sale of the 6.5 Senior Notes were used to repay all amounts owed under the term B-3 loans, the term B-4 loans, the term B-5 loans, the term B-6 loans and the term B-7 loans (together, the Existing Term Loans under the Credit Agreement, as well as to pay related fees and expenses. 
 
 September 2024 Incremental Joinder 
 On September 27, 2024, in connection with our acquisition of Battea, we entered into an Incremental Joinder to our Credit Agreement (the September 2024 Incremental Joinder ). Pursuant to the September 2024 Incremental Joinder, we borrowed 800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of incremental term A-9 loans Term A-9 Loans ), the net proceeds of which were used to finance in part the acquisition of Battea, the payment of fees and expenses related thereto and for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Term A-9 Loans bear interest at, at our option, the Base Rate (as defined in the Incremental Joinder), plus 0.50 per annum, or the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Incremental Joinder), plus 1.50 per annum, in each case with two leverage-based adjustments that increase the interest margin by 0.25 per annum if our consolidated net secured leverage ratio is greater than 3.50x and 4.25x, respectively, and one leverage-based adjustment that reduces the interest rate margin by 0.125 per annum if our consolidated net secured leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50x. 
 
 Debt issuance costs and loss on extinguishment of debt 
 We evaluated the borrowing of our Term B-8 Loans and issuance of 6.5 Senior Notes and the repayment of our Existing Term Loans in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments . We determined that the new debt borrowing and issuance and existing debt repayment were two independent transactions due to the fact that (i) no single investor held a significant concentration of both the old and the new debt, (ii) none of the old investors were included in negotiations with creditors about modifying the old debt, and (iii) all lenders were provided the same opportunity to participate in the new debt regardless of whether they were an existing lender. Consequently, the refinancing was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. As a result, the Existing Term Loans borrowing costs of 27.7 million were expensed and are included in Loss on extinguishment of debt in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 In connection with the May 2024 and September 2024 debt transactions, we capitalized an aggregate of 4.0 million and 38.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, in financing costs, which represent new third-party costs. 
 23 

Debt Terms 
 Our obligations under the Term B-8 Loans and Term A-9 Loans are guaranteed by our existing and future wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions and limitations). The obligations of the loan parties under the amended senior secured credit facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of such persons (subject to customary exceptions and limitations), including a pledge of all of the capital stock of substantially all of the U.S. wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries of such persons (with customary exceptions and limitations) and 65 of the capital stock of certain foreign restricted subsidiaries of such persons (with customary exceptions and limitations). 
 The amended senior secured credit facility includes negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain thresholds and exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur debt or liens, make investments (including in the form of loans and acquisitions), merge, liquidate or dissolve, sell property and assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries, pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock, alter the business we conduct, amend, prepay, redeem or purchase subordinated debt, or engage in transactions with our affiliates. The amended senior secured credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, subject to customary thresholds and exceptions. In addition, the amended senior secured credit facility contains a financial covenant for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Facility requiring us to maintain a maximum consolidated net secured leverage ratio. The amended senior secured credit facility also contains a financial maintenance covenant for the benefit of the Term A-9 Loans that will require us to maintain a separate maximum consolidated net secured leverage ratio. In addition, under the amended senior secured credit facility, certain defaults under agreements governing other material indebtedness could result in an event of default under the amended senior secured credit facility, in which case the lenders could elect to accelerate payments under the amended senior secured credit facility and terminate any commitments they have to provide future borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants. 
 The 5.5 Senior Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by SS C Holdings and all of its existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our existing senior secured credit facilities or certain other indebtedness. The 5.5 Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations that are equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. Interest on the 5.5 Senior Notes is payable on March 30 and September 30 of each year. 
 At any time and from time to time, we may, at our option, redeem some or all of the 5.5 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the following table, expressed as a percentage of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date: 

Redemption Date 
 
 Price 

On or after March 30, 2024 

101.375 

March 30, 2025 and thereafter 

100.000 

At any time prior to June 1, 2027, we may, at our option, redeem some or all of the 6.5 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 6.5 Senior Notes, plus a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, the date of redemption. On and after June 1, 2027, we may, at our option, redeem some or all of the 6.5 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the following table, expressed as a percentage of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date: 

Year

100.000 

We may also, from time to time in our sole discretion, purchase, redeem, or retire any outstanding 5.5 Senior Notes and 6.5 Senior Notes, through tender offers, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, or otherwise. 
 The indentures governing the 5.5 Senior Notes and 6.5 Senior Notes contain a number of covenants that restrict, subject to certain thresholds and exceptions, our ability and the ability of our domestic restricted subsidiaries to incur debt or liens, make certain investments, pay dividends, dispose of certain assets, or enter into transactions with its affiliates. Any event of default under the amended senior secured credit facility that leads to an acceleration of those amounts due also results in a default under the indenture governing each of the Senior Notes. 
 24 

Covenant Compliance 
 Under the Revolving Credit Facility portion of the amended senior secured credit facility, we are required to satisfy and maintain a specified financial ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter if the sum of (i) outstanding amount of all loans under the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) all non-cash collateralized letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility in excess of 20 million is equal to or greater than 30 of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Term A-9 Loans will be subject to a 5.25x consolidated net secured leverage ratio commencing at the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2024, which will, at our option, increase to 5.75x for four consecutive fiscal quarters following a material permitted acquisition. Our ability to meet either financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet either ratio. Any breach of either financial covenant could result in an event of default under the amended senior secured credit facility. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the amended senior secured credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the amended senior secured credit facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Any default and subsequent acceleration of payments under the amended senior secured credit facility would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Additionally, under the amended senior secured credit facility, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is also tied to baskets and ratios based on Consolidated EBITDA. 
 Consolidated EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used in key financial covenants contained in the amended senior secured credit facility, which is the material facility supporting our capital structure and providing liquidity to our business. Consolidated EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the amended senior secured credit facility. We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Consolidated EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with the specified financial ratio and other financial condition tests contained in the amended senior secured credit facility. 
 Management uses Consolidated EBITDA to gauge the costs of our capital structure on a day-to-day basis when full financial statements are unavailable. Management further believes that providing this information allows our investors greater transparency and a better understanding of our ability to meet our debt service obligations and make capital expenditures. 
 Consolidated EBITDA does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Further, the amended senior secured credit facility requires that Consolidated EBITDA be calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter. Further, it may not be comparable to the measure for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year. 
 Consolidated EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and investors should not consider Consolidated EBITDA as a substitute for measures of our financial performance and liquidity as determined in accordance with GAAP, such as net income, operating income or net cash provided by operating activities. Because other companies may calculate Consolidated EBITDA differently than we do, Consolidated EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Consolidated EBITDA has other limitations as an analytical tool, when compared to the use of net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, including: 
 Consolidated EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense we incur as a result of our debt leverage; 

Consolidated EBITDA does not reflect the provision of income tax expense in our various jurisdictions; 

Consolidated EBITDA does not reflect any attribution of costs to our operations related to our investments and capital expenditures through depreciation and amortization charges; 

Consolidated EBITDA does not reflect the cost of compensation we provide to our employees in the form of stock-based awards; 

Consolidated EBITDA does not reflect the equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates; and 

Consolidated EBITDA excludes expenses and income that are permitted to be excluded per the terms of our amended senior secured credit facility, but which others may believe are normal expenses for the operation of a business.

________________________ 
 (1) Acquired EBITDA reflects the EBITDA impact of significant businesses that were acquired during the period as if the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the period, as well as cost savings enacted in connection with acquisitions. 

(2) Purchase accounting adjustments include (a) an adjustment to increase revenues by the amount that would have been recognized if deferred revenue were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisitions, (b) an adjustment to increase personnel and commissions expense by the amount that would have been recognized if prepaid commissions and deferred personnel costs were not adjusted to fair value at the date of the acquisitions and (c) an adjustment to increase or decrease rent expense by the amount that would have been recognized if lease obligations were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisitions. 

(3) Investment gains includes unrealized fair value adjustments of investments and dividend income received on investments. 

(4) Acquisition related includes costs related to both current acquisitions and the resolution of pre-acquisition matters. 

(5) Other includes additional expenses and income that are permitted to be excluded per the terms of our amended senior secured credit facility from Consolidated EBITDA, a financial measure used in calculating our covenant compliance. 

(6) Consolidated EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interest represents Consolidated EBITDA based on the ownership interest retained by the noncontrolling parties of DomaniRx, our consolidated variable interest entity. 

Our covenant requirement for consolidated net secured leverage ratio for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Facility and the actual ratio as of September 30, 2024 are as follows:

 (1) Calculated as the ratio of consolidated net secured funded indebtedness, net of cash and cash equivalents, excluding 159.0 million of cash and cash equivalents held at DomaniRx, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the amended senior secured credit facility, for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ended on the measurement date. Consolidated net secured funded indebtedness is comprised of indebtedness for borrowed money, letters of credit, deferred purchase price obligations and capital lease obligations, all of which is secured by liens on our property. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The standard is applicable to all public entities, including public entities with a single reportable segment, and requires enhanced reportable segment disclosures. The disclosures include significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The standard also requires 
 26 

disclosure of the title and position of the CODM as well as how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment s profit or loss to assess segment performance and decide how to allocate resources. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact the standard will have on our disclosures. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740) . The standard requires more enhanced disclosures specifically related to effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The new requirements will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, on a prospective basis. Early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact the standard will have on our income tax disclosures. 

Item 3. 	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We have generally invested our available cash in short-term, highly liquid financial instruments, having initial maturities of three months or less. When necessary, we have borrowed to fund acquisitions. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We derive service revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in bank accounts on which we are the agent for clients. The balances maintained in the bank accounts will fluctuate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our average daily cash balances of approximately 2,157.3 million were maintained in such accounts. We estimate that a 100 basis point change in the interest earnings rate would equal approximately 10.9 million of net income, net of income taxes, on an annual basis. The effect of changes in interest rates attributable to earnings derived from cash balances we hold for clients is offset by changes in interest rates on our variable debt. 
 At September 30, 2024, total variable interest rate debt was approximately 4,490.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately 44.9 million per year. 
 Equity Price Risk 
 We have exposure to equity price risk as a result of our investments in equity securities. Equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or indexes. The fair value of our investments that are subject to equity price risk as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 51.3 million. The impact of a 10 change in fair value of these investments would have been approximately 3.8 million to net income, net of income taxes. Changes in equity values of our investments could have a material effect on our results of operations and our financial position. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 31 of our revenues were from clients located outside the United States. A portion of the revenues from clients located outside the United States is denominated in foreign currencies, the majority being the British pound. While revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies, some subsidiaries do enter into certain transactions in currencies that are different from their local currency. These transactions consist primarily of cross-currency intercompany balances and trade receivables and payables. As a result of these transactions, we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that result in foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which we report in other income (expense), net. These amounts were not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The amount of these balances can fluctuate in the future as we bill customers and buy products or services in currencies other than our functional currency, which could increase our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. We continue to monitor our exposure to foreign exchange rates because of our acquisitions and changes in our operations. We do not enter into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. 
 The foregoing risk management discussion and the effect thereof are forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in global financial markets. The analytical methods used by us to assess and minimize risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events or losses. 
 
 Item 4. 	Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 
 27 

2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. 	Legal Proceedings 
 The information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved as set forth in Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. 
 In addition, we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our businesses. At this time, we do not believe any material losses under these claims to be probable. While the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, it is in the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, that the final outcome in such proceedings, in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Item 1A. 	Risk Factors 
 As of the date of this report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors we previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
