 For the majority of wholegood vehicles, boats, and parts, garments, and accessories PG A ), the Company transfers control and recognizes a sale when it ships the product from its manufacturing facility, distribution center, or vehicle holding center to the customer. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue it recognizes varies with changes in marketing incentives and rebates it offers to its customers. Payment terms vary by customer and most of the Company s sales are financed by the customer under floorplan financing arrangements whereby the Company receives payment within a few days of shipment of the product. 
 When the right of return exists, the Company adjusts the consideration for the estimated effect of returns. The Company estimates expected returns based on historical sales levels, the timing and magnitude of historical sales return levels as a percent of sales, type of product, type of customer, and a projection of this experience into the future. The Company adjusts its estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration it expects to receive changes or when the consideration becomes fixed. 
 Depending on the terms of the arrangement, the Company may also defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received because it has to satisfy a future obligation. The Company uses an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations. The Company has elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping as an expense in cost of sales when control over vehicles, boats, or PG A has transferred to the customer. 
 The Company sells separately-priced extended service contracts ESCs that extend mechanical coverages beyond the base limited warranty as well as prepaid maintenance agreements to vehicle owners. Including the base limited warranty, these separately-priced service contracts have a duration ranging from months to months. The Company typically receives payment at the inception of the contract and recognizes revenue over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract.

 million for the probable payment of pending claims related to product liability litigation associated with the Company s products. This accrual is included as a component of accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. Amounts due from insurance carriers, to the extent applicable, reduce our financial exposure to product liability claims and are included as a component of prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balances sheets. 
 Litigation. The Company is subject to lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, including matters related to intellectual property, commercial matters, employment, product liability claims and putative class actions. Additional details about certain of the pending putative class actions are provided in Part II, Item 1 Legal Proceedings. 
 In the opinion of management, it is presently unlikely that any legal proceedings pending against or involving the Company will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, in many of these matters, it is inherently difficult to determine whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss given the variety of potential outcomes of actual and potential claims, including legal proceedings resulting in verdicts that exceed policy limits for a given year or seeking punitive damages for certain policy years for which we may not be insured, the uncertainty of future rulings, possible class certification, the behavior or incentives of adverse parties, and other factors outside of the control of the Company. Accordingly, the Company s loss reserve may change from time to time, and actual losses could exceed the amounts accrued by an amount that could be material to the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in any particular reporting period.

Item 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion pertains to the results of operations and financial position of Polaris Inc., a Delaware corporation, for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The terms Polaris, the Company, we, us, and our as used herein refer to the business and operations of Polaris Inc., its subsidiaries and its predecessors, which began doing business in 1954. We design, engineer, manufacture and market powersports vehicles which include: off-road vehicles ORV ), including all-terrain vehicles ATV and side-by-side vehicles; military and commercial ORVs; snowmobiles; motorcycles; moto-roadsters; quadricycles; and boats. We also design and manufacture or source parts, garments and accessories PG A ), which includes aftermarket accessories and apparel. Due to the seasonal trends for certain products and certain changes in production and shipping cycles, results of such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the complete year. Unless otherwise noted, all quarter comparisons are from the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023 and all year-to-date comparisons are from the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 to the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. Estimates related to industry retail sales are unaudited and based on internally-generated management estimates, including estimates based on extrapolations from third-party surveys of the industries in which we compete, and are subject to change. 
 Overview 
 Third quarter sales totaled 1,722.4 million, a decrease of 23 percent from last year s third quarter sales of 2,248.9 million. The decrease in sales for the quarter was primarily due to decreased shipments in all segments, product mix, and lower net pricing driven by higher promotional costs. 
 Our gross profit of 354.6 million decreased 30 percent from 508.8 million in the comparable prior year third quarter. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased primarily due to product mix, lower net pricing driven by higher promotional costs, and decreased leverage of fixed costs as a result of reduced sales volumes. These decreases were partially offset by favorable operational costs. 
 Net income attributable to Polaris was 27.7 million, or 0.49 per diluted share, compared to 2023 third quarter net income attributable to Polaris of 151.7 million, or 2.62 per diluted share. These decreases were primarily the result of decreased shipments in all segments, product mix, lower net pricing driven by higher promotional costs, and decreased leverage of fixed costs as a result of reduced sales volumes, partially offset by favorable operating costs. We reported third quarter Adjusted EBITDA of 159.1 million, compared to 2023 third quarter Adjusted EBITDA of 282.6 million. For information on how we define and calculate Adjusted EBITDA, and a reconciliation from net income to Adjusted EBITDA, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 We use the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income, excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and certain other non-cash, non-recurring, or non-operating items impacting net income from time to time. For example, costs associated with certain corporate restructuring activities, such as acquisitions and divestitures, are included as non-GAAP adjustments. We use the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. 
 We believe that these measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. 
 Adjusted EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operating and financing activities, including funds as needed from our credit facility and issuances of long-term debt. Our primary uses of funds have been for new product development, capital investments, cash dividends to shareholders, repurchases and retirements of common stock, and acquisitions. The seasonality of production and shipments cause working capital requirements to fluctuate during the year and from year to year. 
 We believe that existing cash balances and cash flows to be generated from operating activities, borrowing capacity under our credit facility and from future issuances or borrowings of long-term debt, will be sufficient to fund operations, new product development, cash dividends to shareholders, repurchases and retirement of common stock, and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: 
 in millions) Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Total cash provided by (used for): Operating activities 61.9 376.0 (314.1) Investing activities (218.2) (345.9) 127.7 Financing activities 82.8 (61.4) 144.2 
 Operating Activities: 
 The decrease in net cash from operating activities was primarily the result of lower net income. 
 Investing Activities: 
 The primary sources and uses of cash were for the purchase of property, equipment and tooling for continued capacity and capability at our manufacturing, distribution, and product development facilities, and distributions from and contributions to Polaris Acceptance. Net cash used for investing activities decreased due to a reduction in property, equipment and tooling purchases, as well as increased distributions from Polaris Acceptance. These decreases were partially offset by strategic investments in the current year. 
 Financing Activities: 
 The increase in net cash from financing activities was primarily due to increased net borrowings under debt arrangements and lower share repurchases, partially offset by reduced proceeds from stock issuances under employee plans. Net borrowings totaled 271.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 157.7 million of net borrowings for the comparable period in 2023. 
 Financing Arrangements: 
 We are party to an unsecured Master Note Purchase Agreement, as amended and supplemented, under which we have issued senior notes. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings under the Master Note Purchase Agreement totaled 350.0 million. 
 We are also party to an unsecured credit facility, which includes a 1.0 billion variable interest rate Revolving Loan Facility that matures in June 2026, under which we have unsecured borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, there were borrowings of 141.6 million outstanding under the Revolving Loan Facility. Our credit facility also includes a Term Loan Facility, on which 744.0 million was outstanding as of September 30, 2024. We are required to make principal payments under the Term Loan Facility totaling 45 million over the next 12 months. For the credit facility, interest is charged at rates based on Adjusted Term SOFR plus the applicable add-on percentage, as defined in the agreements governing the credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had 850.9 million of availability on the Revolving Loan Facility. 
 In November 2023, we amended the credit facility to terminate all guarantees provided by our subsidiaries under the credit facility, remove the requirement for our subsidiaries to provide guarantees of the obligations under the credit facility, and remove certain of our subsidiaries as co-borrowers.

Table of Contents 

 In July 2024, the Company further amended the credit facility to provide for a new incremental 364-day term loan in the amount of 400 million (the Incremental Term Loan Facility ). The Incremental Term Loan Facility is unsecured and has a term ending on July 25, 2025. As with other borrowings under the credit facility, interest is charged at rates based on Adjusted Term SOFR plus the applicable add-on percentage, as defined in the agreements governing the credit facility. Net proceeds from the Incremental Term Loan Facility were used to repay amounts outstanding under the Company s Revolving Loan Facility. 
 The agreements governing the facility and the Master Note Purchase Agreement contain covenants that require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios, including minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios. The agreements also require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 and a leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00 on a rolling four quarter basis. 
 In November 2023, we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95 Senior Notes pursuant to a public offering. We received approximately 492 million in net proceeds from the notes offering after deducting the underwriting discount and other fees and expenses. The notes bear interest at a rate of 6.95 per year, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears in March and September of each year. The notes mature in March of 2029. The indenture governing the notes is subject to customary covenants and make-whole provisions upon early termination. 
 On July 2, 2018, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 29, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Boat Holdings, LLC, a privately held Delaware limited liability company, headquartered in Elkhart, Indiana which manufactures boats Boat Holdings ). As a component of the Boat Holdings merger agreement, we have committed to make a series of deferred payments to the former owners through July 2030. The original discounted payable was for 76.7 million, of which 43.2 million was outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and our debt to total capital ratio was 62 percent. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we had letters of credit outstanding of 48.6 million, primarily related to purchase obligations for raw materials. 
 Share Repurchases: 
 We repurchased a total of approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock for 82.3 million during the first nine months of 2024, which had a favorable impact of two cents on diluted net income per share. As of September 30, 2024, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to an additional 1,109.3 million of our common stock. 
 Wholesale Customer Financing Arrangements: 
 We have arrangements with certain finance companies to provide secured floor plan financing for our dealers. These arrangements provide liquidity by financing dealer purchases of our products without the use of our working capital. A majority of the worldwide sales of snowmobiles, ORVs, motorcycles, boats, and related PG A are financed under similar arrangements whereby we receive payment within a few days of shipment of the product. We participate in the cost of dealer financing up to certain limits. 
 Under these arrangements, we have agreed to repurchase products repossessed by these finance companies. As of September 30, 2024, the potential aggregate repurchase obligations were approximately 407.4 million. Our financial exposure under these repurchase agreements is limited to the difference between the amounts unpaid by the dealer with respect to the repossessed product plus costs of repossession and the amount received on the resale of the repossessed product. No material losses have been incurred under these agreements during the periods presented. 
 Retail Customer Financing Arrangements: 
 We have agreements with third-party financing companies to provide financing options to end consumers of our products. We have no material contingent liabilities for residual value or credit collection risk under these agreements.

 Refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a complete discussion on the Company s market risk. There have been no material changes in market risk from those disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Refer below for further discussion on commodity cost risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, and interest rate risk. 
 Inflation: 
 We are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodities and raw materials, including steel, aluminum, copper, petroleum-based resins, certain rare earth metals and diesel fuel. In addition, we are a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities, including steel, aluminum, rubber and others, which are integrated into our end products. While such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. We generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process. We enter into commodity hedging contracts in order to manage fluctuating market prices of certain commodities such as steel and diesel fuel. Based on our current outlook for commodity prices, the total impact of commodities is expected to have a favorable impact on our gross profit margins for full-year 2024 when compared to 2023. 
 Foreign Exchange Rates: 
 The changing relationships of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies can have a material impact on our financial results. 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 Euro: We have operations in the Eurozone through wholly owned subsidiaries and distributors. We also purchase components from certain suppliers directly for our U.S. operations in transactions denominated in Euros. Fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate impacts sales, cost of sales and net income. 
 Canadian Dollar: We operate in Canada through a wholly owned subsidiary. The relationship of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Canadian dollar impacts sales, cost of sales and net income. 
 Other currencies: We operate in various countries, principally in Europe, Mexico and Australia, through wholly owned subsidiaries. We also sell to certain distributors in other countries and purchase components from certain suppliers directly for our U.S. operations in transactions denominated in these foreign currencies. The relationship of the U.S. dollar in relation to these other currencies impacts sales, cost of sales and net income. 
 We actively manage our exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates by entering into foreign exchange hedging contracts. A portion of our foreign currency exposure is mitigated with the following open foreign currency hedging contracts as of September 30, 2024: 
 Foreign Currency 
 Foreign currency hedging contracts Currency Position Notional amounts (in millions of U.S. Dollars) Average exchange rate of open contracts 
 Australian Dollar Long 21.3 0.68 to 1 AUD Canadian Dollar Long 154.0 0.75 to 1 CAD Mexican Peso Short 130.9 19.2 Peso to 1 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, after consideration of the existing foreign currency hedging contracts, foreign currencies had a neutral impact on net income compared to 2023. We expect currencies to have a negative impact on full-year net income in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 The assets and liabilities in all of our international entities are translated at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Translation gains and losses are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. Revenues and expenses in all of our international entities are translated at the average foreign exchange rate in effect for each month of the year. Certain assets and liabilities related to intercompany positions reported on our consolidated balance sheets that are denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency are translated at the foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the associated gains and losses are included in net income. 
 Interest Rates: 
 We are a party to an unsecured credit facility with various lenders consisting of a 1.0 billion Revolving Loan Facility, a 1.2 billion Term Loan Facility and a 400 million Incremental Term Loan Facility. Interest accrues on the revolving loan, term loans and Incremental Term Loan Facility at variable rates based on Adjusted Term SOFR plus the applicable add-on percentage, as defined in the agreements governing the credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, there was 141.6 million outstanding on the Revolving Loan Facility, 744.0 million outstanding on the Term Loan Facility and 400.0 million outstanding on the Incremental Term Loan Facility. We enter into interest rate swaps in order to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates associated with our debt. We expect interest rates to have a negative impact on full-year net income in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Borrowings pursuant to our private senior notes and public senior notes bear interest at fixed rates. We are subject to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate borrowings as a result of potential changes in prevailing interest rates. Changes in the fair value of fixed-rate borrowings have no impact on the amount of interest incurred, cash flows or our financial position.

 Item 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the latest fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Part II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are involved in a number of legal proceedings incidental to our business, none of which is presently expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, or the financial results of our business. 
 As of the date hereof, we are party to certain putative class actions brought by the same plaintiff s counsel and largely repeating the same allegations regarding various state consumer protection laws focused on rollover protection structures certifications for various Polaris off-road vehicles sold in California. The first case brought in federal court in California related to this matter Guzman/Albright was first reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The district court granted summary judgment against both plaintiffs claims, which the plaintiffs appealed. The Ninth Circuit issued two rulings in September 2022 that reversed the district court s summary judgment rulings and remanded the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss one plaintiff s claims without prejudice. The plaintiff whose claims were dismissed without prejudice refiled the putative class action in California State Court under the name Albright . In June 2023, the Albright court granted the parties stipulation to stay that case pending a decision on class certification in federal court in the Guzman case. On September 27, 2023, the district court in Guzman entered an order granting in part and denying in part plaintiff s motion for class certification. The district court certified a California class for plaintiff s claim seeking money damages under the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act but denied class certification on plaintiff s claim seeking injunctive relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). On October 11, 2023, Polaris filed a petition to appeal the portion of the district court s order granting class certification. On December 14, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied Polaris s petition. On June 27, 2024, the state court in Albright entered an order setting a hearing for December 20, 2024 to review the stay of proceedings in that case. Plaintiff s counsel s related case Hellman/Berlanga was first reported in the Company s quarterly report for the period ended June 30, 2021. Since then, the Hellman plaintiff has been dismissed and, in May 2023, the remaining plaintiff in the Berlanga case filed a motion for class certification, which we opposed. On July 16, 2024, the federal district court entered an order granting in part and denying in part plaintiff s motion for class certification. The federal district court certified a California class for plaintiff s claim seeking money damages but denied class certification on plaintiff s claim seeking injunctive relief. On July 17, 2024, the federal district court ordered that the Guzman case and the Berlanga case be consolidated for all purposes. Trial is currently set to begin on May 5, 2025. 
 With respect to each of the aforementioned putative class action lawsuits, we are unable to provide any reasonable evaluation of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred or any reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss. 

Item 1A RISK FACTORS 
 Please consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes or additions to our risk factors discussed in such report which could materially affect the Company s business, financial condition, or future results.
