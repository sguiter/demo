 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act are statements that are not historical facts and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations. These statements constitute projections, forecasts and forward-looking statements, and are not guarantees of performance.

When used therein, words such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, should, strive, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Such statements are based on the beliefs of, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to, our management. 
 Forward-looking statements may include, for example, statements about: 
 the outcome of the United States U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA review of our Biologics License Application BLA seeking approval of our bioengineered human acellular vessels (Acellular Tissue Engineered Vessel or ATEV TM , formerly referred to as the Human Acellular Vessel or HAV in urgent arterial repair following extremity vascular trauma when synthetic graft is not indicated and autologous vein graft is not feasible; 
 our plans and ability to execute product development, process development and preclinical development efforts successfully and on our anticipated timelines; 
 our plans, anticipated timeline and ability to file applications for, and obtain marketing approvals from, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory authorities, including the European Medicines Agency, for our ATEV and other product candidates; 
 our ability to design, initiate and successfully complete clinical trials and other studies for our product candidates and our plans and expectations regarding our ongoing or planned clinical trials, including for our V007 and V012 Phase 3 clinical trials; 
 the outcome of our ongoing discussions with the FDA concerning our BLA for vascular trauma and the design of our clinical trials; 
 our anticipated growth rate and market opportunities; 
 the potential liquidity and trading of our securities; 
 our ability to raise additional capital in the future; 
 our ability to use our proprietary scientific technology platform to build a pipeline of additional product candidates; 
 the characteristics and performance of our ATEVs; 
 our plans and ability to commercialize our ATEVs and other product candidates, if approved by regulatory authorities; 
 the degree of market acceptance of ATEVs, if approved by regulatory authorities, and the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement; 
 our ability to manufacture ATEVs and other product candidates in sufficient quantities to satisfy our clinical trial and commercial needs, if approved by regulatory authorities; 
 our expectations regarding our strategic partnership with Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. Fresenius Medical Care to sell, market and distribute our 6 millimeter ATEV for certain specified indications and in specified markets, if approved by regulatory authorities; 
 the expected size of the target populations for our product candidates; 
 the anticipated benefits of our ATEVs relative to existing alternatives;

Any forward-looking statements are based on information current as of the date of this Quarterly Report and speak only as of the date on which such statements are made. Actual events or results may differ materially from the results, plans, intentions or expectations anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated is included from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including, but not limited to, those described in the sections titled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which we filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

 million and million, respectively. The Company s operating losses were million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash flows used in operating activities were million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Substantially all of the Company s operating losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with the Company s research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with the Company s operations. On August 9, 2024, the FDA informed the Company that the FDA required additional time to complete its review of the Company s BLA for the ATEV in adults as a vascular conduit for extremity arterial injury when urgent revascularization is needed to avoid imminent limb loss, and autologous vein graft is not feasible. The Company will have an additional million available for draw under the Purchase Agreement (as defined below) upon the Company receiving FDA approval of the ATEV for the vascular trauma indication on or prior to December 31, 2024. The Company expects to incur substantial operating losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future as the Company advances its product candidates. 
 As further disclosed in Note 6, on May 12, 2023, Humacyte, Inc. and Global entered into a Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with purchasers, both affiliates of Oberland Capital Management LLC (the Purchasers ), and another affiliate of Oberland Capital Management LLC, as agent for the Purchasers, to obtain financing with respect to the further development and commercialization of the Company s ATEV, to repay the Company s then-existing credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank SVB ), and for other general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, million was recorded as a revenue interest liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

 million over which the Agent has certain consent and other rights to million of the funds. The Company funded an account with the required million on August 14, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the million was classified as restricted cash on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 The Company is required to evaluate whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance date of its financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of million and restricted cash of million. 
 As further disclosed in Note 8, on September 24, 2024, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC Lincoln Park for an equity line financing (the Common Stock Purchase Agreement ). The Common Stock Purchase Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Company has the sole right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share Common Stock ), having an aggregate value of up to million (the Purchase Shares over a -month period. The Company controls the timing and amount of any sales of Purchase Shares to Lincoln Park pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement in its sole discretion. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million in remaining availability for sales of Common Stock under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had completed sales of shares under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement that provided million in gross proceeds, and as further disclosed in Note 13, from September 30, 2024 through November 8 2024, the Company completed sales of shares to Lincoln Park that provided million in additional gross proceeds. 
 As further disclosed in Note 13, on October 7, 2024, the Company received net proceeds of approximately million in connection with the closing of the Registered Direct Offering (as defined in Note 13). 
 As noted above, the Company funded the restricted cash account, in accordance with the amended Purchase Agreement, of which million is not subject to the Company s unilateral control. Based on current plans and assumptions, which exclude this million of cash and the potential approval of the BLA from its forecasted liquidity, the Company will not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund its operations beyond one year from the issuance of these financial statements if the Company is unable to achieve approval of the ATEV and generate sufficient cash flows from commercial sales on a timely basis and/or obtain additional capital. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the Company will, over the course of the next year, require additional financing to continue its operations. Adequate additional capital may not be available to the Company when needed or on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient capital when required, the Company may be required to reduce or discontinue its operations, sell assets, or cease all operations. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 As of September 30, 2024, restricted cash includes million maintained in an account that is not subject to the Company s unilateral control, in accordance with the amended Purchase Agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company classified million in funds maintained in a separate deposit account to secure a letter of credit for the benefit of the lessor of the Company s headquarters lease, and million in cash balances held as collateral for the Company s employee credit card program as restricted cash.

 Contingent Earnout Shares, as defined in Note 8, are excluded from the anti-dilutive table for all periods presented, as such shares are contingently issuable until the share price of the Company exceeds specified thresholds that have not yet been achieved, or upon the occurrence of a change in control. The Option Agreement, as defined in Note 6 Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement, is excluded from the anti-dilutive table for all periods presented based on the Company s assumption that the Option Agreement will not be exercised unless the Company s stock price exceeds per share, the minimum purchase price under the Option Agreement. 
 Other Risks and Uncertainties 
 The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, successful discovery and development of its product candidates, the success of clinical trials and other studies for its product candidates, including its ongoing V007 and V012 Phase 3 clinical trials, the regulatory approval and commercialization of its ATEVs and other product candidates, the expected size of the target populations for the Company s product candidates, the degree of market acceptance of the ATEVs, if approved, the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement, development by competitors of new technological innovations, the ability to manufacture ATEVs and other product candidates in sufficient quantities, expectations regarding the Company s strategic partnerships, dependence on third parties, key personnel and the ability to attract and retain qualified employees, protection of proprietary technology and confidentiality of trade secrets, compliance with governmental regulations, the Company s implementation and maintenance of effective internal controls, and the ability to secure additional capital to fund operations and the commercial success of its product candidates. 
 Product candidates currently under development will require extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel, and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if the Company s commercialization efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize significant revenue from product sales, and the Company may depend on certain strategic relationships to distribute its products, including the Company s strategic partnership with Fresenius Medical Care, to sell, market and distribute its 6 millimeter ATEV for certain specified indications outside the United States.

 Total financial assets Liabilities: Contingent Earnout Liability Contingent derivative liability Private Placement Warrants liability Option Agreement liability JDRF Agreement derivative liability Total financial liabilities 
 The fair value of the Contingent Earnout Liability, Private Placement Warrants liability (each as defined in Note 8 Stockholders Equity (Deficit)), contingent derivative liability related to the Put Option (as defined in Note 6 Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement and discussed below), Option Agreement liability (as defined in Note 6 Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement), and the derivative liability associated with the JDRF Agreement Disposition Payment are based on significant unobservable inputs, which represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the Private Placement Warrants liability, the Option Agreement liability and the derivative liability associated with the JDRF Agreement Disposition Payment, are included in other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Common Stock Purchase Agreement 
 shares of Common Stock issued to Lincoln Park as consideration for its irrevocable commitment to purchase up to million in shares of Common Stock. The initial fair value of million was based on the closing price of the Common Stock on September 24, 2024, which was per share, and the derivative asset is reported as a component of long-term assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative asset are dependent upon, among other things, changes in the closing share price of Common Stock, the quantity and purchase price of the shares purchased by Lincoln Park during the reporting period and the unused capacity under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. The Common Stock Purchase Agreement is subsequently remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded as a component of other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The change in fair value of the derivative asset between the September 24, 2024 issuance date and September 30, 2024 was insignificant.

The assumptions utilized in the calculation were based on the achievement of certain stock price milestones, including the current Common Stock price, expected volatility, risk-free rate, expected term and expected dividend yield (see Note 8 Stockholders Equity (Deficit)).

 In determining the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants liability, the Company used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to estimate the fair value utilizing assumptions including the current Company stock price, expected volatility, risk-free rate, expected term and expected dividend yield (see Note 8 Stockholders Equity (Deficit)).

The estimated probability and timing of underlying events triggering the exercisability of the Put Option contained within the Purchase Agreement, forecasted cash flows and the discount rates are significant unobservable inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of the entire instrument with the embedded derivative. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the discount rates used to calculate the value of the contingent derivative liability were to calculate the present-value of the revenue forecast and to calculate the present-value of the payoff of the Put Option. As of December 31, 2023, the discount rates used to calculate the value of the contingent derivative liability were to calculate the present-value of the revenue forecast and to calculate the present-value of the payoff of the Put Option. Changes in fair value of the contingent derivative liability are recognized as other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, classified in change in fair value of derivative liabilities.

In February 2024, the FDA accepted the Company s BLA for an indication in vascular trauma, and in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, on March 11, 2024, the Company received a subsequent installment of million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company is entitled to receive up to approximately million in subsequent installments subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, as follows: (i) million, at the Company s option, upon the Company receiving FDA approval of the ATEV for the vascular trauma indication on or prior to December 31, 2024 and (ii) million, at the Company s option, upon reaching million trailing worldwide three-month net sales any time prior to December 31, 2025. Each tranche is dependent on the satisfaction of the conditions and receipt of funds from the previous tranche. 
 Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Revenue Interests entitle the Purchasers to receive a royalty initially equal to (the Rate of global net sales of the Company s products (subject to a lower rate for net sales by specified licensees outside the United States), to be paid on a calendar quarterly basis (the Revenue Interest Payments ). 
 If the Purchasers do not receive cumulative Revenue Interest Payments equal to of the amount funded to date (the Cumulative Purchaser Payments by the last business day of 2028 (the Test Date ), the Rate will increase to a rate that, had such increased rate applied during the period from May 12, 2023 through the Test Date, would have provided the Purchasers with cumulative Revenue Interest Payments equal to the Cumulative Purchaser Payments as of the Test Date. Additionally, Global will be required to pay the Purchasers an amount equal to of the Cumulative Purchaser Payments as of the Test Date less the total Revenue Interest Payments made by Global to the Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement as of the Test Date. Global s obligation to make Revenue Interest Payments terminates on the date on which the Purchasers have received Revenue Interest Payments of of the Cumulative Purchaser Payments unless the Purchase Agreement is terminated earlier due to the Purchaser s exercise of a Put Option, the Company s exercise of a call option, or by mutual consent.

 million on August 14, 2024, over which the Agent has certain consent and other rights to million of the funds. As of September 30, 2024, million of the funded account was classified as long-term restricted cash on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 The Company has provided a parent company guaranty to guarantee the payment in full of the obligations under the Purchase Agreement. The Company s obligations under the parent company guaranty and Global s obligations under the Purchase Agreement and the Revenue Interests are secured by a perfected security interest on substantially all of the Company s and its subsidiaries assets. 
 The Purchase Agreement is considered a sale of future revenues and accounted for as long-term debt recorded at amortized cost using the interest method. 
 The Company recorded a revenue interest liability related to the Purchase Agreement on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet on the date the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement, net of a debt discount comprised of million issuance costs and transaction costs, million fair value allocated to the Option Agreement, defined below, and the million initial fair value of the bifurcated contingent derivative liability related to the Put Option. The revenue interest liability is based on the Company s contractual repayment obligation to the Purchasers, based on the current estimates of future revenues, over the life of the Purchase Agreement. The Company imputes interest expense associated with this liability using the interest method. The effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the anticipated life of the arrangement. The interest rate on this liability may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors, including the level and expected timing of forecasted net sales. The Company evaluates the interest rate quarterly based on its current net sales forecasts. If the level and timing of any forecasted net sales and related payments change, the Company prospectively adjusts the effective interest and the related amortization of the liability and related issuance costs on a quarterly basis. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, was recorded as a revenue interest liability. The estimated effective annual interest rate as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was and , respectively. The Company recorded million and million in interest expense related to the Purchase Agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and recorded million and million in interest expense related to the Purchase Agreement for the three and nine month ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company incurred and paid million of transaction costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in connection with the Purchase Agreement. The transaction costs were capitalized to debt discount and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated term of the debt, consistent with the issuance and transaction costs incurred in 2023 discussed above. 
 The Put Option under the Purchase Agreement that is exercisable by the Purchasers upon certain contingent events was determined to be an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation and separately accounted for as a single compound derivative instrument. At May 12, 2023, the Company recorded the initial fair value of the derivative liability of million as a debt discount. On March 11, 2024, upon the issuance of the second installment of the Purchase Agreement of million, the Company estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative and recorded a million increase in fair value as a debt discount. The debt discount is being amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the debt using the interest method. See Note 3 Fair Value Measurements for a further discussion of the fair value of the contingent derivative liability associated with the Put Option.

 Equity Line Financing 
 On September 24, 2024, the Company entered into the Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park for an equity line financing, which provides that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Company has the sole right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park shares of Common Stock having an aggregate value of up to million over a -month period.

In consideration for entering into the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company issued shares of Common Stock (the Commitment Shares to Lincoln Park. The Company did not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of the Commitment Shares. The fair value of the Common Stock Purchase Agreement was measured on the issuance date based on the fair value of the Commitment Shares, which was the consideration given to Lincoln Park in exchange for entering into the agreement. The fair value of the Commitment Shares on the issuance date was determined to be million based on the closing price of the Common Stock on September 24, 2024, which was per share. The Company recognized the fair value of the Commitment Shares as a non-current asset as a component of long-term assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Common Stock Purchase Agreement is subsequently remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded as a component of other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

 publicly-traded warrants Public Warrants and private placement warrants issued to AHAC Sponsor LLC (the Sponsor ), Oppenheimer Co. Inc. and Northland Securities, Inc., in connection with AHAC s initial public offering Private Placement Warrants and, together with the Public Warrants, the Common Stock Warrants ). The Common Stock Warrants entitle the holder to purchase share of Common Stock at an exercise price of per share. The Company evaluated the Common Stock Warrants to determine the appropriate financial statement classification upon the consummation of the Merger. The Common Stock Warrants are not mandatorily redeemable and are considered to be freestanding instruments as they are separately exercisable into Common Stock. As such, the Common Stock Warrants were not classified as liabilities under FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . The Company then evaluated the Common Stock Warrants under FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . 
 Public Warrants 
 The Public Warrants are publicly traded and are exercisable for cash unless certain conditions occur, such as the failure to have an effective registration statement related to the shares issuable upon exercise or redemption by the Company under certain conditions, at which time the Public Warrants may be eligible for a cashless exercise. The Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares and will expire after the completion of the Merger. 
 The Public Warrants are considered to be indexed to the Company s own stock. The agreement provides that in the event of a tender or exchange offer made to and accepted by holders of more than of the outstanding shares of the Company s Common Stock, all holders of the Common Stock Warrants (both the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants) would be entitled to receive cash for all of their Common Stock Warrants. As the Company has a single class of Common Stock, a qualifying cash tender offer of more than of the Common Stock will always result in a change in control and would not preclude permanent equity classification of the Public Warrants. Based on this evaluation, the Company concluded that the Public Warrants meet the criteria to be classified within stockholders equity. The Public Warrants were initially recognized as equity on the Closing Date at a fair value of per share. 
 Private Placement Warrants 
 The Private Placement Warrants are non-redeemable for cash so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants are redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 
 
 The Private Placement Warrants were initially recognized as a liability on the Closing Date, at a fair value of million. See Note 3 Fair Value Measurements for a summary of the change in the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The remeasurement of the Private Placement Warrant liability to a fair value of million as of September 30, 2024 from million as of December 31, 2023 resulted in non-cash losses of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to an insignificant non-cash gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a non-cash loss of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The remeasurement of the Private Placement Warrant liability is classified within Change in fair value of derivatives in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

 See Note 3 Fair Value Measurements for a summary of the change in the fair value of the Contingent Earnout Liability during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The remeasurement of the Contingent Earnout Liability to a fair value of million as of September 30, 2024, from a fair value of million as of December 31, 2023, resulted in non-cash losses of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to non-cash losses of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, related to the remeasurement of the Contingent Earnout Liability.

 Prior to the Closing, Legacy Humacyte had equity incentive plans, the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended (the 2015 Plan ), and the 2005 Stock Option Plan (the 2005 Plan ). As a result of the Merger, no further awards will be granted under either the 2015 Plan or the 2005 Plan. All awards previously granted and outstanding as of the effective date of the Merger were adjusted to reflect the impact of the Merger as set forth in the Merger Agreement, but otherwise retained their original terms. The shares underlying any award granted under the 2021 Plan or the 2015 Plan that are forfeited, cancelled or reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, that expire or that are paid out in cash rather than shares will become available for grant and issuance under the 2021 Plan.

 The Company s stock option plans allow for the grant of awards that the Company believes aid in aligning the interests of award recipients with those of its stockholders. The Company s board of directors or compensation committee determines the specific terms of equity incentive grants, including the exercise price per share and vesting period for option awards. Option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock at the date of grant. 
 The Company has granted options that include either a service-based or performance-based vesting condition, or both, and a contractual term. The service-based vesting condition for the plans is generally satisfied over to months from the date of grant. The performance-based vesting conditions are satisfied upon the attainment of certain product development milestones.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Quarterly Report and with our audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report. In addition, you should read the Risk Factors and Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements sections of this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report to the Company, Humacyte, we, us, our and similar terms refer to Humacyte, Inc. (formerly known as Alpha Healthcare Acquisition Corp.) and its consolidated subsidiary (Humacyte Global, Inc.) following the Merger (defined below); references to Legacy Humacyte refer to Humacyte, Inc. prior to the Merger; and references to AHAC refer to Alpha Healthcare Acquisition Corp. prior to the Merger. 
 
 Overview 
 We are pioneering the development and manufacture of off-the-shelf, universally implantable, bioengineered human tissues, advanced tissue constructs and organ systems with the goal of improving the lives of patients and transforming the practice of medicine. We believe our regenerative medicine technology has the potential to overcome limitations in existing standards of care and address the lack of significant innovation in products that support tissue repair, reconstruction and replacement. We are leveraging our novel, scalable technology platform to develop proprietary bioengineered, acellular human tissues for use in the treatment of diseases and conditions across a range of anatomic locations in multiple therapeutic areas. 
 We are initially using our proprietary, scientific technology platform to engineer and manufacture ATEVs. Our investigational ATEVs are designed to be easily implanted into any patient without inducing a foreign body response or leading to immune rejection. We are developing a portfolio, or cabinet , of ATEVs with varying diameters and lengths. The ATEV cabinet would initially target the vascular repair, reconstruction and replacement market, including use in vascular trauma; arteriovenous AV access for hemodialysis and peripheral artery disease PAD ). We are also developing the ATEV for coronary artery bypass grafting CABG and pediatric heart surgery. Over the longer term, we are developing our ATEV for the delivery of cellular therapies, including pancreatic islet cell transplantation to treat Type 1 diabetes (our BioVascular Pancreas or BVP TM ). We will continue to explore the application of our technology across a broad range of markets and indications, including the development of urinary conduit, trachea, esophagus and other novel cell delivery systems. 
 For the ATEV, we believe there is substantial clinical demand for safe and effective vascular conduits to replace and repair blood vessels throughout the body. Vascular injuries resulting from trauma are common in civilian and military populations, frequently resulting in the loss of either life or limb. Existing treatment options in the vascular repair, reconstruction and replacement market include the use of autologous vessels and synthetic grafts, which we believe suffer from significant limitations. For example, the use of autologous veins to repair traumatic vascular injuries can lead to significant morbidity associated with the surgical wounds created for vein harvest and prolonged times to restore blood flow to injured limbs, leading to an increased risk of complications such as amputation and reperfusion injury. In addition, in many instances of vascular trauma the patient may not have adequate vein available, or the time between injury and treatment is too long, to make autologous graft repair feasible. Synthetic grafts are often contraindicated in the setting of vascular trauma due to higher infection risk that can lead to prolonged hospitalization and limb loss. Given the competitive advantages our ATEVs are designed to have over existing vascular substitutes, we believe that ATEVs have the potential to become the standard of care and lead to improved patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs.

 We and our collaborators are currently conducting Phase 3 and Phase 2 trials of our 6 millimeter ATEV across three therapeutic indications: vascular trauma, AV access for hemodialysis, and PAD. We were granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for our 6 millimeter ATEV for use in AV access for hemodialysis in 2014. We also received the first Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy RMAT designation from the FDA, for the creation of vascular access for performing hemodialysis, in March 2017. In May 2023, we were granted the RMAT designation for the ATEV for urgent arterial repair following extremity vascular trauma, and in June 2024, we were granted the RMAT designation for the ATEV for patients with advanced PAD. In addition, in 2018 our ATEV product candidate was assigned a priority designation by the Secretary of Defense under Public Law 115-92, enacted to expedite the FDA s review of products that are intended to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions facing American military personnel. 
 In September 2023, we announced positive topline results from our V005 Phase 2/3 trial in vascular trauma, and in December 2023, we filed a BLA for urgent arterial repair following extremity vascular trauma when synthetic graft is not indicated, and when autologous vein use is not feasible. In February 2024, the FDA accepted the BLA filing and granted priority review and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of August 10, 2024. On August 9, 2024, the FDA informed us that it required additional time to complete its review of the BLA for the vascular trauma indication. 
 In April 2023, we announced completion of enrollment of our V007 Phase 3 trial of the ATEV for use in AV access for hemodialysis. In July 2024, we announced positive topline results from our V007 Phase 3 trial in which the ATEV met the primary endpoints in the study. We expect to discuss a potential market authorization pathway for the ATEV with the FDA for an indication in AV access for hemodialysis. 
 We have generated no product revenue and incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations in each year since our inception in 2004. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 665.1 million and 537.3 million, respectively, and working capital of 2.1 million and 64.8 million, respectively. Our operating losses were approximately 30.2 million and 86.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 24.6 million and 73.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Net cash flows used in operating activities were 71.5 million and 54.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to incur substantial operating losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 20.6 million and restricted cash of 50.4 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we received an additional 29.6 million in net proceeds from the Registered Direct Offering and sales of shares to Lincoln Park under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. The extension of time required by the FDA to review our vascular trauma BLA, and the delay in potential approval, has delayed, among other items, our ability to draw an additional 40.0 million in Purchase Agreement proceeds. Accordingly, we do not believe our available cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to fund operations, including clinical trial expenses and capital expenditure requirements, for at least one year from the date of this Quarterly Report without achieving approval of the ATEV for vascular trauma and generating sufficient cash flows from commercial sales on a timely basis and/or obtaining additional capital. See Note 1 Organization and Description of Business in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding this assessment. 
 Our need for additional capital will depend in part on the scope and costs of our development and commercial manufacturing activities, and the results of our planned upcoming commercial sales efforts. To date, we have not generated any revenue from the sale of commercialized products. Our ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Until such time, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the use of existing cash and cash equivalents, the sale of equity or debt, proceeds from the Purchase Agreement, borrowings under credit facilities, or through potential collaborations, other strategic transactions or government and other grants. Adequate capital may not be available to us when needed or on acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise capital, we could be forced to delay, reduce, suspend or cease our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts, which would have a negative impact on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. See Risk Factors for additional information.

Table of Contents 

 We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and to increase operating losses for at least the next several years. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we seek to: 
 obtain marketing approval for our 6 millimeter ATEV for vascular repair, reconstruction and replacement including for indications in vascular trauma and AV access for hemodialysis; 
 commercialize the ATEV via U.S. market launch for indications in vascular trauma and hemodialysis AV access, if approved; 
 scale out our manufacturing facility to the extent required to satisfy potential market demand following receipt of any regulatory approval; 
 continue our preclinical and clinical development efforts; 
 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 
 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel to support, among other things, our product development and commercialization efforts and operations; and 
 continue operating as a public company, which includes higher costs associated with hiring additional personnel, director and officer insurance premiums, audit and legal fees and expenses for compliance with public company reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 To date, we have not generated revenue from the sale of any products. All of our revenue has been derived from government and other grants. From inception through September 30, 2024 we have been awarded grants, including grants from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine CIRM ), the National Institutes of Health NIH ), and the Department of Defense, to support our development, production scaling and clinical trials of our product candidates. We may generate revenue in the future from government and other grants, payments from future license or collaboration agreements and, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, from product sales. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. If we fail to complete the development of, or obtain marketing approval for, our product candidates in a timely manner, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Since our inception, we have focused our resources on our research and development activities, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, developing and refining our manufacturing process and activities related to regulatory filings for our product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of: 
 salaries and related overhead expenses for personnel in research and development functions, including stock-based compensation and benefits; 
 fees paid to clinical research organizations CROs and consultants, including in connection with our clinical trials, and other related clinical trial fees, such as for clinical site fees and investigator grants related to patient screening and treatment, conduct of clinical trials, laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis; 
 allocation of facility lease and maintenance costs; 
 depreciation of leasehold improvements, laboratory equipment and computers; 
 costs related to purchasing raw materials and producing our product candidates for clinical trials; 
 costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; 
 costs related to our manufacturing development and expanded-capabilities initiatives; and 
 license fees related to in-licensed technologies.

Table of Contents 

 The majority of our research and development resources are currently focused on our Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for our 6 millimeter ATEV and other work needed to obtain marketing approval for our 6 millimeter ATEV for use for vascular repair, reconstruction and replacement, including indications in vascular trauma and AV access in hemodialysis in the United States. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with these and our other clinical development efforts, including expenses related to regulatory filings, trial enrollment and conduct, data analysis, patient follow up and study report generation for our Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 Direct expenses for our vascular trauma, AV Access and PAD indications include costs related to our clinical trials, including fees paid to CROs, consultants, clinical sites and investigators. Costs related to development activities which broadly support multiple programs using our technology platform, including personnel, materials and supplies, external services costs, and other internal expenses, such as facilities and overhead costs, are not allocated to individual research and development programs. Other research and development expenses reported in the table below include direct costs not identifiable with a specific product candidate, including costs associated with our research and development platform used across programs, process development, manufacturing analytics and preclinical research and development for prospective product candidates and new technologies. 
 The successful development of our preclinical and clinical product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot estimate with any reasonable certainty the nature, timing or costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of any of our preclinical or clinical product candidates or the period, if any, in which material net cash inflows from these product candidates may commence. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates, including: 
 the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our preclinical development activities, our ongoing clinical trials and any additional clinical trials that we may conduct, and other research and development activities; 
 successful patient enrollment in and the initiation and completion of clinical trials; 
 the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities including the FDA and non-U.S. regulators; 
 the extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities; 
 development and refinement of clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that it or its third-party manufacturers are able to successfully manufacture our product; 
 obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; 
 significant and changing government regulations; 
 launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; 
 the degree of market acceptance of any product candidates that obtain marketing approval; and 
 maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile following approval, if any, of our product candidates. 
 A change in the outcome of any of these variables could lead to significant changes in the costs and timing associated with the development of our product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate being required to conduct in order to complete the clinical development of any of our product candidates, or if we experience significant delays in the enrollment or the conduct of any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for employees in executive, finance, human resources, commercialization, and administrative support functions, which also include stock-based compensation expenses and benefits for such employees. Other significant general and administrative expenses include facilities costs, professional fees for accounting and legal services and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 We expect our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future to support our expanded infrastructure and increased costs of operating as a public company and as we prepare for our anticipated commercial launch of the ATEV. These increases are expected to include increased employee-related expenses, increased sales and marketing expenses, and increased director and officer insurance premiums, audit and legal fees, and expenses for compliance with public company reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and rules implemented by the SEC, as well as Nasdaq rules. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Total other income (expense), net consists of (i) the change in fair value of the Contingent Earnout Liability that was accounted for as a liability as of the date of the Merger, and is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period, resulting in a non-cash gain or loss, (ii) interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, (iii) interest expense incurred on the Purchase Agreement (defined above), finance leases, and our former loan agreement with SVB, during the periods each were outstanding, (iv) the change in fair value of our derivative liabilities and asset including the private placement Common Stock warrant liabilities related to the Private Placement Warrants, which we assumed in connection with the Merger; the contingent derivative liability related to the Purchase Agreement; a liability related to the Option Agreement; a derivative liability related to our agreement with JDRF; and a derivate asset related to our Common Stock Purchase Agreement, all of which are subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date resulting in a non-cash gain or loss, (v) a loss on debt extinguishment related to the prepayment of our loan agreement with SVB in May 2023, and (vi) an employee retention credit we recognized in June 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We have historically financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt, including pursuant to the Offering, proceeds from the Merger and related PIPE Financing, borrowings under loan facilities, the Purchase Agreement, and, to a lesser extent, through grants from governmental and other agencies. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 665.1 million and 537.3 million, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had working capital of 2.1 million and 64.8 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 20.6 million and 80.4 million, respectively, and restricted cash of 50.4 million and 0.4 million, respectively. We are required to evaluate whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance date of our financial statements. We funded the restricted cash account on August 14, 2024, in accordance with our amended Purchase Agreement, of which 50.0 million is not subject to our unilateral control. 
 As disclosed in Note 13 Subsequent Events to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, on October 7, 2024, we received net proceeds of approximately 28.1 million in connection with the closing of the Registered Direct Offering. From September 30, 2024 through November 8 2024, we sold 300,000 shares to Lincoln Park under our Common Stock Purchase Agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of 1.5 million. As of November 8 2024, we had 47.5 million in remaining availability for sales of Common Stock under our Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park. 
 Based on current plans and assumptions, which excludes the 50.0 million of restricted cash and the potential approval of the BLA from our forecasted liquidity, we will not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations beyond one year from the issuance of these financial statements if we are unable to achieve approval of the ATEV and generate sufficient cash flows from commercial sales on a timely basis and/or obtain additional capital. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will, over the course of the next year, require additional financing to continue our operations. Adequate additional capital may not be available to us when needed or on acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital when required, we may be required to reduce or discontinue our operations, sell assets, or cease all operations. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. See Note 1 Organization and Description of Business to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding our assessment. We believe that our longer-term working capital, planned research and development, capital expenditures and other general corporate funding requirements may be satisfied through the sale of equity, debt, borrowings under credit facilities or through potential

 collaborations with other companies, other strategic transactions or government or other grants. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the sections entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we could be forced to further delay, reduce, suspend or cease our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts, which would have a negative impact on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. 
 On May 12, 2023, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with the Purchasers and another affiliate of Oberland Capital Management LLC, as agent for the Purchasers, to obtain financing in respect to the further development and commercialization of our ATEV, to repay the Loan Agreement, and for other general corporate purposes. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and subject to customary closing conditions, the Purchasers have agreed to pay us an aggregate investment amount of up to 150.0 million. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, 40.0 million of the Investment Amount, less certain transaction expenses, was funded on May 12, 2023 , which was used to repay in full and retire our indebtedness under the Loan Agreement, with the remaining proceeds funded to the Company. On March 11, 2024, 20.0 million of the Investment Amount was funded to the Company. See Note 6 Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details about this financing transaction. 
 On February 18, 2024, we agreed with the Purchasers and the Agent, to waive certain breaches related to, and extend the deadline for certain post-closing obligations under, the Purchase Agreement, including the requirement for us to deliver a leasehold mortgage in favor of the Agent over our headquarters. On May 8, 2024, we reached an agreement with the Purchasers to amend the Purchase Agreement to remove requirements related to the leasehold mortgage. In exchange for the removal of this requirement, on August 14, 2024 we funded an account in the amount of 54.0 million, over which the Agent will have certain consent and other rights to 50.0 million of the funds. See Note 6 for further information. 
 On February 29, 2024, we entered into the Underwriting Agreement in connection with the Offering. The net proceeds to us from the Offering were approximately 43.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and Offering expenses. The Offering closed on March 5, 2024. 
 On September 24, 2024, we entered into the Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park for an equity line financing, which provides that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, we have the sole right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park shares of Common Stock having an aggregate value of up to 50.0 million over a 24-month period. We control the timing and amount of any sales to Lincoln Park. As of September 30, 2024, we had completed sales of shares under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement that provided 1.0 million in gross proceeds, and as further disclosed in Note 13 Subsequent Events, from September 30, 2024 through November 8 2024, we completed sales of shares that provided 1.5 million in additional gross proceeds. As of November 8 2024, we had 47.5 million in remaining availability for sales of our Common Stock under our Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park. 
 On October 4, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor pursuant to which the investor purchased approximately 30.0 million worth of Common Stock and Registered Direct Warrants in the Registered Direct Offering. The net proceeds to us from the Registered Direct Offering were approximately 28.1 million, after deducting placement agent s fees and offering expenses of approximately 1.9 million. The Registered Direct Offering closed on October 7, 2024. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our known material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of supplies and services that are primarily for research and development; (2) repayments pursuant to the Purchase Agreement; (3) employee wages, benefits, and incentives; (4) financing and operating lease payments (for additional information see below), and (5) payments under our JDRF Agreement (see Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report) . We have also entered into contracts with CROs primarily for clinical trials. These contracts generally provide for termination upon limited notice, and therefore we believe that our non-cancellable obligations under these agreements are not material. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, for example, legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, we had non-cancellable purchase com mitments of 23.0 million for supplies and services that are primarily for research and development. We have existing license agreements with Duke University and Yale University, a distribution agreement with Fresenius Medical Care and our JDRF Agreement. The amount and timing of any potential milestone payments, license fee payments, royalties and other payments that we may be required to make under these agreements are unknown or uncertain at September 30, 2024. For additional information regarding our agreement with Fresenius Medical Care, see Note 12 Related Party Transactions to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. For additional information regarding our agreements with Duke University, Yale University and JDRF, see Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement 
 On May 12, 2023, we entered into the Purchase Agreement and repaid in full all of the outstanding obligations under our Loan Agreement with SVB and SVB Innovation Credit Fund VIII, L.P. Under the Purchase Agreement, as of September 30, 2024, we had 62.1 million recorded as a revenue interest liability on our condensed consolidated financial statements. For additional information regarding repayment, see Note 6 Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 Leases 
 Our finance leases relate to our headquarters facility containing our manufacturing, research and development and general and administrative functions, which was substantially completed in June 2018 and is being leased through May 2033, and our operating lease relates to the land lease associated with our headquarters. Our future contractual obligations under our lease agreements as of September 30, 2024 are as follows: 
 in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 
 3 5 years 
 More than 5 years Finance leases 
 22,465 4,186 7,524 4,414 6,341 Operating lease 
 810 105 210 210 285 
 ATM Facility 
 On September 1, 2022, we entered into an agreement for the sale from time to time up to 80.0 million of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a sales agreement (the ATM Facility ). As of September 30, 2024, we have not conducted any sales of Common Stock under the ATM Facility. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 We expect to incur significant expenses in connection with our ongoing activities as we seek to (i) continue clinical development of our 6 millimeter ATEV for use in vascular trauma and hemodialysis AV access and submit a BLA for FDA approval of an indication in hemodialysis AV access, (ii) to launch and commercialize our ATEVs for vascular repair and hemodialysis AV access, if marketing approval is obtained, in the U.S. market, as well as subsequent launches in key international markets, (iii) advance our pipeline in major markets, including PAD Phase 3 trials and continue preclinical development and advance to planned clinical studies in CABG and BVP for diabetes, and (iv) scale out our manufacturing facility as required to satisfy market demand. We will need additional funding in connection with these activities. 
 Our future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including: 
 the progress and results of our clinical trials and interpretation of those results by the FDA and other regulatory authorities; 
 the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates, particularly for marketing approval of our ATEVs in the United States; 
 the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our additional product candidates; 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 the cost and timing of our future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing and distribution for our ATEVs if approved by the FDA, and any other product candidate for which we receive marketing approval in the future; 
 the amount and timing of revenues, if any, that we receive from commercial sales of any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 
 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and 
 the costs of operating as a public company, including hiring additional personnel as well as increased director and officer insurance premiums, audit and legal fees, and expenses for compliance with public company reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we are able to successfully develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, we expect to continue financing our operations through the sale of equity, debt, borrowings under credit facilities or through potential collaborations with other companies, other strategic transactions or government or other grants. Adequate capital may not be available to us when needed or on acceptable terms. Other than the Purchase Agreement, we do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures. Debt financing would also result in fixed payment obligations. If we are unable to raise capital, we could be forced to delay, reduce, suspend or cease our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts, which would have a negative impact on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. 
 Our principal use of cash in recent periods has been primarily to fund our operations, including the clinical and preclinical development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including the progress and results of our clinical trials and preclinical development, timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, cost and timing of future commercialization activities, and the amount and timing of revenues, if any, that we receive from commercial sales. 
 See the section of this Quarterly Report entitled Risk Factors for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.

 Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 The increase in net cash used in operating activities from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increased spending on pre-clinical, clinical and pre-commercial activities as well as payroll and personnel expenses, expansion of clinical development of the ATEV for use in AV access, and preparation for the planned commercial launch of the ATEV for an indication in vascular trauma, if approved by the FDA. 
 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of purchases of property and equipment, which fully offset proceeds from the maturity of our short-term investments (certificates of deposit). 
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of 43.0 million of net proceeds from our Offering and 19.5 million of net proceeds from our Purchase Agreement. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of 37.9 million of net proceeds from our Purchase Agreement, partially offset by 31.8 million of cash payments related to the repayment of our Loan Agreement. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in SEC rules and regulations.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates based on different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. 
 An accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption involves a significant level of estimation uncertainty, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, included in our Annual Report. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies until it is no longer an emerging growth company. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. We expect to use the extended transition period and, therefore, while we are an emerging growth company we will not be subject to new or revised accounting standards at the same time that they become applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, unless we choose to early adopt a new or revised accounting standard. This may make it difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
 Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act Regulation S-K ). Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company if (1) the market value of Common Stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues in our most recent fiscal year completed before the last business day of its second fiscal quarter are less than 100 million and the market value of Common Stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We qualify as a smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K and, thus, are not required to provide the information required by this Item.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company currently is not aware of any legal proceedings or claims that management believes will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our risk factors are disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from or updates to the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report . 
 We have concluded that a substantial doubt is deemed to exist concerning our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 As further discussed in Note 1 Organization and Description of Business in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, substantial doubt is deemed to exist about the company s ability to continue as a going concern through November 8, 2025. Our financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern will require us to generate positive cash flow from operations, obtain additional financing, enter into strategic alliances, or sell assets. Our cash resources and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital, enter into strategic alliances on a timely basis or at all. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. 
 Our near-term prospects are dependent on the commercial success of our product candidates, if approved, and if we are unable to successfully commercialize them, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially harmed. 
 Our business currently depends heavily on our ability to successfully commercialize our ATEVs in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we may obtain marketing approval. We may never be able to successfully commercialize our ATEVs or meet our expectations with respect to revenues for a number of reasons, including: 
 a lack of acceptance of our ATEVs by physicians, patients, third-party payors and other members of the medical community; 
 our limited experience in marketing, selling and distributing our ATEVs or any other product; 
 our limited experience in the commercial manufacturing of our ATEVs or any other product; 
 reimbursement and coverage policies of government and private payors such as Medicare, Medicaid, group purchasing organizations, insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators; 
 changed or increased regulatory restrictions in the United States, EU and other foreign territories; and 
 a lack of adequate financial or other resources to commercialize our ATEVs successfully. 
 There is no guarantee that the infrastructure, systems, processes, policies, relationships, and materials we have built for the launch and commercialization of our approved product in the United States will be sufficient for us to achieve success at the levels we expect. If we are not able to commercialize our ATEVs successfully for these or other reasons, our ability to generate revenue from product sales and achieve profitability will be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.

Table of Contents 

 The manufacture of our product candidates is complex, we have limited experience manufacturing commercial product, and we have in the past and may in the future encounter batch failures and difficulties in production. If we or any third-party supplier encounter such difficulties, our ability to supply our product candidates for clinical trials or, if approved, for commercial sale could be delayed or halted entirely. 
 The process of manufacturing our ATEVs is complex, highly regulated and subject to multiple risks. The manufacture of biologics such as our ATEVs has been, and continues to be, susceptible to product loss and batch failures due to a range of factors including raw material and other component deficiencies, contamination, equipment failure, temporary power outages, improper installation or operation of equipment, damage to facilities, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics and difficulties in scaling the production process. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes has resulted, and could in the future result, in reduced production yields, batch failures, product defects and other supply disruptions. For example, from time to time we have had multiple batch failures in succession. We believe we have identified the root cause of those failures and have implemented appropriate corrective actions. However, if our corrective actions are not successful, or if the FDA disagrees with our root cause analysis or our corrective actions, it may delay or disrupt our manufacturing operations or delay or prevent the filing or approval of marketing applications for our ATEVs, including our pending BLA. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, manufacturing may be delayed or disrupted for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition as well as our reputation. We depend on cell banks in our manufacturing process, and the loss or alteration of our master cell banks would result in significant disruptions to that process. 
 We currently manufacture the 6 millimeter ATEVs for our clinical trials and for planned initial commercial distribution, at our manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina, where we have created a scalable modular manufacturing process, which we refer to as the LUNA200 system, that we believe will enable us to manufacture our ATEVs, if approved, in commercial quantities in compliance with current good manufacturing practices cGMPs ). Our efforts to scale out our manufacturing operations may not succeed. Scaling out a biologic manufacturing process is a difficult task, as there are risks including, among others, cost overruns, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency and timely availability of raw materials. We have limited years of experience manufacturing our ATEVs in-house with the LUNA200 system, and no experience manufacturing the volume of ATEVs that we anticipate will be required to supply all of our clinical trials or to achieve planned levels of commercial sales following marketing approval, if received. Additionally, our manufacturing process has evolved over time and we may not have the experience, resources, or facility capacity to handle adoption of future changes or expansion of capacity. The forecasts of demand we plan to use to determine order quantities and lead times for components from outside suppliers may be incorrect, and we may be unable to obtain such components when needed and at a reasonable cost. We also have experienced interruptions in the supply of the raw materials required to manufacture our product candidates, and increased costs due to supply chain disruptions or inflation in the cost of goods, services or other operating inputs. Likewise, supply chain interruptions could affect the transport of clinical trial materials, such as our ATEVs and other supplies used in our clinical trials, which would negatively impact our ability to conduct our clinical trials. In addition, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient manufacturing capabilities and processes to manufacture our ATEVs in sufficient volumes that also satisfy the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design and production standards required to commercialize our ATEVs successfully. 
 If we are unable to produce sufficient quantities of our ATEVs for our clinical trial needs or commercialization, we may need to make additional changes to our manufacturing processes and procedures. Such changes to our manufacturing platform could trigger the need to conduct additional bridging studies between our prior clinical supply and that of any new manufacturing processes and procedures. Should we experience delays or be unable to produce sufficient quantities of our ATEVs utilizing our current or a modified version of our manufacturing system, we expect that our development and commercialization efforts would be impaired as a result, which would likely materially adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.

 The sizes of the market opportunities for our product candidates has not been established with precision and are estimates that management believes to be reasonable. If these market opportunities are smaller than we estimate, or if any approval that we obtain is based on a narrower definition of the relevant patient population, our revenue and ability to achieve profitability might be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our estimates of the market opportunity for our ATEVs, if approved, and certain of our other product candidates are based on a number of internal and third-party estimates. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying these estimates are reasonable, they may be inaccurate or based on imprecise data. In addition, the assumptions and conditions underlying the estimates may change at any time. For example, the number of patients who ultimately use our product candidates, if approved by regulatory authorities, and our total market opportunities for such product candidates, will depend on, among other things, pricing and reimbursement, market acceptance of those product candidates and patient access, and may be lower than we estimate. Additionally, any approval we receive for our product candidates may be based on a narrower definition of the relevant patient population than we have estimated. Either of these circumstances could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Our product candidates, if approved, may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success. 
 The commercial success of our ATEVs will depend, in part, on the acceptance of physicians, patients and health care payors as medically necessary, cost-effective and safe. Our ATEVs and any other product that we commercialize may not gain acceptance by physicians, patients, health care payors and others in the medical community due to ethical, social, medical and legal concerns. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable. 
 The degree of market acceptance of our ATEVs or any of our other product candidates that receives marketing approval will depend on a number of factors, including: 
 the efficacy and potential advantages of our ATEVs or our other product candidates compared with alternative products or methods, including convenience and ease of administration; 
 the prices we charge for our products, if approved; 
 the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement; 
 the willingness of the target patient population to try new products and methods and of physicians to use these products and methods; 
 the quality of our relationships with patient advocacy groups; 
 the strength of marketing and distribution support; 
 the availability of the product and our ability to meet market demand; 
 the prevalence and severity of any side effects; and 
 any restrictions on the use of our ATEVs or our other products, if approved. 
 There is uncertainty with respect to third-party coverage and reimbursement of our ATEVs, if approved, and our other product candidates. They may also be subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, any of which could harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. 
 There is uncertainty around third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved regenerative medicine type products. In the United States, third-party payors, including government payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which medical products and biologics will be covered and reimbursed. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and government payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies. Currently, no RMAT tissue engineered product has established coverage and reimbursement by the CMS. It is difficult to predict what CMS or any comparable foreign regulatory agency will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for novel products such as our ATEVs and our other product candidates, as there is no body of established practices and precedents for these types of products. 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 The healthcare industry is acutely focused on cost containment, both in the United States and elsewhere. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement. These payors may not view our ATEVs and our other products, if approved, as cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to our customers or may not be sufficient to allow our products, if any, to be marketed on a competitive basis. Cost control initiatives could also cause us to decrease any price we might establish for products, if approved, which could result in lower than anticipated product revenue. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any such product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including our costs related to research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Reimbursement rates may vary, by way of example, according to the use of the product, if approved, and the clinical setting in which it is used. If the prices for our products, if any, decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will suffer, perhaps materially. 
 On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act IRA into law, which sets forth meaningful changes to drug product reimbursement by Medicare. Among other actions, the IRA permits the Department of Health and Human Services HHS to engage in price-capped negotiation to set the price of certain drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. The IRA contains statutory exclusions to the negotiation program, including for certain orphan designated drugs for which the only approved indication (or indications) is for the orphan disease or condition. Should our product candidates be approved and covered by Medicare Part B or Part D, and fail to fall within a statutory exclusion, such as that for an orphan drug, those products could, after a period of time, be selected for negotiation and become subject to prices representing a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. The IRA also establishes a rebate obligation for drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D covered drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. The inflation rebates may require us to pay rebates if we increased the cost of a covered Medicare Part B or Part D approved product faster than the rate of inflation. In addition, the law eliminates the donut hole under Medicare Part D beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and requiring manufacturers to subsidize, through a newly established manufacturer discount program, 10 of Part D enrollees prescription costs for brand drugs below the out-of-pocket maximum and 20 once the out-of-pocket maximum has been reached. Our cost-sharing responsibility for any approved product covered by Medicare Part D could be significantly greater under the newly designed Part D benefit structure compared to the pre-IRA benefit design. Additionally, manufacturers that fail to comply with certain provisions of the IRA may be subject to penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The IRA is anticipated to have significant effects on the pharmaceutical industry and may reduce the prices we can charge and reimbursement we can receive for our products, among other effects. 
 Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare resulting from the IRA or other legislative or policy changes, or from other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. These healthcare reforms and the implementation of any future cost containment measures or other reforms may prevent us from being able to generate sufficient revenue, attain and/or maintain profitability or commercialize our drug candidates. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or the effect of forthcoming guidance implementing the IRA, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on our product candidates or the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. 
 In some countries, particularly in Europe, the pricing of our product may be subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products, if approved, is unavailable or more limited in scope or amount than we anticipate, or if pricing is set at even lower levels than we anticipate, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.

 Lack of experience by investigators and surgeons with our ATEVs can lead to incorrect implantation or follow-up procedures which could harm the results of our clinical trials and market acceptance of our ATEVs, if approved. 
 Until approved by the FDA, our ATEVs are currently in various stages of preclinical and clinical testing. We do not have the personnel capacity to directly conduct or manage solely with our own personnel all of the clinical trials that are necessary for the development of our ATEVs. Therefore, we rely, and will continue to rely, on third parties to assist us in managing, monitoring and conducting our clinical trials. Some of the investigators in our clinical trials have not been, and, if our ATEVs receive marketing approval, surgeons may not be, previously exposed to the implantation and follow-up procedures related to their use. As a result, our ATEVs may be, and have been in the past, incorrectly implanted and follow-up procedures may be performed incorrectly, resulting in increased interventions or failure of the ATEV, and complicating interpretation of clinical trial results. Our efforts to educate investigators, surgeons and interventionalists regarding the proper techniques for use of our ATEVs both during clinical trials and following potential commercialization may be costly, prove unsuccessful and could materially harm our ability to continue the clinical trials or commence marketing of our ATEVs. Regulatory authorities may also seek to impose restrictive labeling or proactive communication obligations on any marketing approval granted for use of our ATEVs as a result, which could reduce market acceptance of any of our ATEVs that receive marketing approval. 
 Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities that may not be covered by our limited product liability insurance and may limit the development, approval and commercialization of our ATEVs and any other product candidates that we develop in the future. 
 We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our ATEVs and our other product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk, when we commercially sell our ATEVs and any other product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our ATEVs or our other product candidates caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in: 
 decreased demand for our ATEVs or any other product candidates that we develop or sell, leading to loss of revenue; 
 injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention; 
 withdrawal, or slower enrollment, of clinical trial participants; 
 significant costs to defend the related litigation and reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; 
 substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; and 
 inability to further develop or commercialize our ATEVs or our other product candidates. 
 We currently hold limited product liability insurance coverage, and it may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.
