 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

Support agreements entered into with customers
are generally for a period of one year, during which the Company stands ready to provide service and support for installed systems at
the customer site. Support agreement amounts are billed in advance to the customer, as agreed in the contract, and recorded as a contract
liability. During the period, the Company provides unspecified firmware upgrades to installed client equipment as they are available.
Management estimates that straight line recognition of revenue over the period of the support agreement contract is representative of
the pattern of delivery on the Company s obligation under these agreements. 

The Company has applied the practical expedient
that permits the Company to recognize revenue without regard to significant financing components based on the Company s expectations
about the transfer of services and the receipt of payment from customers. The effect of this practical expedient is not material to the
Company s financial statements. 

Sales tax is recorded on a net basis and excluded
from revenue. 

at September 30, 2024, and have reported negative cash flows from operations. In addition, we do not currently
have the cash resources to meet our operating commitments for the next twelve months from the date of this report. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

In addition, the Company expects to have ongoing
requirements for capital investment to implement its business plan. Finally, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
must be considered in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered by entrance into established markets and
the competitive environment in which it operates. 

Since inception, operations have primarily been
funded through private placements of equity and convertible debt. Management expects to continue to seek additional funding through private
or public sources. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is ultimately dependent on its ability to generate sufficient
cash from operations to meet cash needs and/or to raise funds to finance ongoing operations and repay debt. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be successful in these efforts. These factors, among others, indicate substantial doubt that the Company will be
able to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the filing of these financial statements. Managements plan is
to raise additional funding through a capital raise associated with a public offering and/or additional private capital raises. 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should it be unable to continue as a going concern. 

As of September 30, 2024, our cash balance was
 . Our plan for satisfying our cash requirements for the next twelve months is through sales-generated income, including revenue
from our installation contracts with the Texas school districts, private placements of our capital stock, exercise of warrants, third
party financing, and/or traditional bank financing. We anticipate sales-generated income during that same period, but do not anticipate
generating sufficient revenues to meet our working capital requirements. Consequently, we intend to attempt to find sources
of additional capital in the future to fund our growth and expansion through additional equity or debt financing or credit facilities.
There is no assurance that we will be able to meet our working capital requirements through the private placement of equity or debt or
from any other source. We estimate that we will need approximately 3,400,000 of capital or financing over the next twelve months to fund
our planned operations. 

Over Time 

The Company earns revenues from in-building cellular
systems and network services. Revenues from the sale and installation of in-building cellular systems, including fixed wireless, SmartDAS,
and 4G LTE, totaled and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and and 
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The contracts for the sale of in-building cellular systems generally include
the performance obligation to sell and install (including testing, commissioning, and integration services) equipment. The amount of revenue
earned related to the sales of equipment was and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
and and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The amount of revenue earned related
to installation and other services was and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and
 and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The performance obligation for the sale of
equipment is deemed to be satisfied on the date the customer takes physical possession of the equipment and has control of the equipment.
For installation, testing, commissioning and integration services, the Company measures progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance
obligations ratably as the services are performed. 

Revenues from network and other services totaled
 and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Network service revenues are recognized each month as services are rendered. 

The Company s contracts for support services
are typically for terms of one year or less. The aggregate amount of contract performance obligation as of September 30, 2024 that
the Company expects to recognize over the next year is . 

The Company is under no obligation and is not
in the practice of providing customers with returns, rebates, discounts, or refunds. The Company, accordingly, does not recognize these
obligations at the time of revenue recognition. The Company may receive future consideration from customers who enter into support agreements.
Those services are delivered as of a point in time when the customer requests the service. Future consideration as described is excluded
from the transaction price calculated for support agreement performance obligations. 

during the year ended December 31, 2023. The investment is classified as a cost method investment as the fair
value of the investment is not readily determinable. The investment is valued as cost, less impairment, adjusted for any observable price
changes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no distributions received and the Company determined that no impairment
existed at September 30, 2024.

at the date of grant, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The volatility used is based on historical volatilities of selected
peer group companies. Management estimated the fair value of the underlying common stock by utilizing the discounted cash flow method
and the prior transaction method approaches and determined a fair value of 5.00 before July 30, 2024 and at trading value after being
listed on July 30, 2024. Management estimates the average volatility considering current and future expected market conditions. The risk-free
interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
grant. Each issuance is individually valued according to this procedure as of the date of issue with maturity dates through October 11,
2026, volatility estimates between 27.27 to 29.69 and risk-free rates 4.50 to 5.07 in the period.

Overview of Current Operations 

Wytec International, Inc.,
a Nevada corporation Wytec, the Company, we, us, or our ), is a
designer and developer of small cell technology and wide area networks designed to support 5G network deployments across the United States.
Currently, we offer in-building cellular (known as a distributed antenna system, DAS and private Long-term Evolution private
LTE solutions utilizing multiple vendors through a channel agreement with Synnex Corporation, a leading
distributor and solutions aggregator hosting more than 22,000 technology vendors across the world. Concurrently, Wytec is the owner of
patented small cell technology , which we call the LPN-16, designed to support
dense citywide 5G network coverage. Small cell technology is purported by PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited to be the key component
to 5G deployment. 

In September 2023, we engaged
Trabus Technologies to begin Wytec s artificial intelligence AI ), machine learning ML ), and blockchain
software development in preparation for a series of state and federal pilot projects to be conducted across the United States which are
expected to commence in the first quarter of 2025. In October 2023, Wytec filed two provisional patent applications with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office USPTO to enhance its LPN-16 small cell to include AI, ML, and blockchain technologies capable
of supporting advanced multi-sensor technology. 

In October 2023, Wytec signed
a development agreement with Lemko Corporation to manufacture the updated version of our LPN-16 with AI, ML, and blockchain technologies.
This agreement was signed in conjunction with our development of an integrated solution with the Nextivity Corporation Nextivity to enhance the in-building solution, utilizing Nextivity s Cel-Fi, we currently offer to the over 190 Independent School District ISD members of the Central Texas Purchasing Alliance CTPA ). Wytec plans to include gunshot and drug detection
solutions in conjunction with its in-building cellular services as a part of a pilot project offered to over 40 of the CTPA members requesting
to be included in the pilot program. 

We expect 5G to have a transformative
impact on the economy and we believe that 5G citywide deployments will rely substantially on small cell technology to facilitate this
impact. We believe our LPN-16 small cell can solve many of the long-term challenges faced by operators needing access to implement their
5G initiatives. It can also assist cities challenged with on-going technology upgrades, network growth demands, political hurdles, and
new business models needed to realize the benefits of a 5G network. In addition to aligning with technical and governmental issues, the
LPN-16 is designed to meet the standards for 5G deployment and, for operator needs, adheres to the Federal Communications Commission FCC policy initiatives addressing public safety and First Responder initiatives. Specifically, the FCC s Report and Order 14-153, Acceleration
of Broadband Deployment by Improving Wireless Facilities Siting Policies , adopts rules to help spur wireless broadband deployment
by facilitating the sharing of wireless transmission equipment using neutral host functionality to simultaneously support
multiple providers. The LPN-16 was specifically designed to support neutral host features and performance. The FCC s goal of shared
used and neutral host seeks to expand coverage and capacity more quickly, reduce costs, and promote access to infrastructure
which reduces barriers to deployment and incentivize the sharing of resources, rather than relying on new builds for every stakeholder,
thereby safeguarding environmental, aesthetic, historic and local land-use values. 

We have implemented an aggressive
intellectual property strategy and continue to pursue patent protection for new innovations. In addition to the LPN-16 covered by our
current patent, we have identified additional upgrades and additions to the LPN-16 which further tie it to the goals and timelines of
Wytec s 5G development business model, FCC policy initiatives, and customer business usage which we believe could lead to additional
patentable property. We intend to file for patent protection on these developments. Our strategy is to continually monitor the costs and
benefits of our patent applications and pursue those that will best protect our business and expand the core value of the Company.

We have recruited and hired
a seasoned management team with both private and public company experience and relevant technical and industry experience to develop and
execute our operating plan. In addition, we have identified key engineering resources for intellectual property development, antenna development,
and hardware, software, and firmware engineering, as well as integration and testing that we believe will allow us to continue to expand
our technology and intellectual property. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations, including the discussion on liquidity and capital resources, are based upon our
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management re-evaluates its estimates
and judgments, particularly those related to the determination of the estimated recoverable amounts of trade accounts receivable, impairment
of long-lived assets, revenue recognition and deferred tax assets. We believe the following critical accounting policies require more
significant judgment and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition. 
Wytec International, Inc. follows the revenue standards of Financial Accounting Standards Board Update No. 2014-09: Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The core principle of the revenue model is that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains
control of a good or service. A customer obtains control when it has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the
good or service. Revenue is recognized in accordance with that core principle by applying the following five steps: 1) identify the contract
with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations; and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. 

Our contracts for the sale
of Cel-Fi systems generally include the performance obligation to sell and install (including testing, commissioning and integration services)
equipment. The performance obligation is deemed satisfied once the equipment has been installed, placed in service and customer signs
off on their acceptance, at a point in time. 

Network service revenues are
recognized each month as services are rendered. 

The Company generally provides
a one-year warranty on its products for materials and workmanship but may provide multiple year warranties as negotiated, and will pass
on the warranties from its vendors, if any, which generally covers this one-year period. In accordance with ASC 450-20-25, the Company
accrues for product warranties when the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. At June 30, 2024, the Company has estimated
no product warranty accrual given the Company s de minimis historical financial warranty experience. 

Revenue is recorded and recognized
when installation is complete. Maintenance and monitoring rates are pre-set based upon the building s square footage. Cost of sales
includes all equipment and labor that is connected to a project and all other costs are general and administrative. Laredo Independent
School District projects are subject to contracted rates. 

Warrants: The Company
estimates and applies its judgement when determining the inputs to the Black Scholes calculation that is used to calculate the expense
for the warrants issued. The volatility used is based on historical volatilities of selected peer group companies. Management estimated
the fair value of the underlying common stock by utilizing the discounted cash flow method and prior transaction method approaches. Management
estimates the average volatility considering current and future expected market conditions. The risk-free interest rate for periods within
the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Each issuance is individually
valued according to this procedure as of the date of issuance. 

Results of Operations for the Three and Nine
months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenues for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 88,034 and 201,826, respectively. The decrease in revenues of 113,792 or 56 was primarily due
to a decrease in revenue from our in-building cellular systems. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 128,146
and 245,046, respectively. The decrease in revenues of 116,900 or 48 was primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our in-building
cellular systems. 

23 

Cost of revenues for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 30,617 and 129,718, respectively. This decrease of 99,101, or 76 , was primarily due to
a decrease in costs incurred related to the sales of our in-building cellular systems. Cost of revenues for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 was 55,570 and 165,664, respectively. This decrease of 110,094, or 66 , was primarily due to a decrease in costs
incurred related to the sales of our in-building cellular systems. 

General and administrative
expenses were 546,622 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 496,147 for the three months ended September 30, 2023,
resulting in an increase of 50,475 or 10 . Contributing factors to the increase include an increase in stock compensation of 135,638,
an increase in fees, subscriptions and charges of 21,637, and an increase in marketing and advertising of 56,281 which was offset by
a decrease in professional fees by 141,485 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. General and administrative expenses
were 2,301,202 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,135,131 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting
in an increase of 1,166,071 or 103 . Contributing factors to the increase include an increase in fees, subscriptions and charges of 46,118,
an increase in stock compensation of 1,118,623, and an increase in marketing and advertising of 35,238 which was offset by a decrease
in office expense by 40,222 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

We estimate that we will need
approximately 3,400,000 of capital or financing over the next twelve months to fund our planned operations, which we plan to satisfy
as described below under Satisfaction of our Cash Needs for the Next 12 Months. 

We anticipate that we will
incur operating losses in the next twelve months. Our revenue is not expected to exceed our investment and operating costs in the next
twelve months. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies
in their early stage of operations. To address these risks, we must, among other things, seek growth opportunities through investment
and acquisitions, implement and successfully execute our business strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and
motivate qualified personnel. We cannot assure that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have
a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Cash Flow from Operating Activities 

Cash flows used in operating
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,386,569 compared to 1,147,631 during the nine months ended September
30, 2023. This increase of cash flow used of 238,938 was primarily due to increased research and development expenditures during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cash Flow from Investing Activities 

Cash flows used in investing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,899 compared to the cash flows used in investing activities of -0-
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Capital expenditures totaled 1,899 and -0- during the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Cash Flow from Financing Activities 

Cash flows provided by financing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 925,160 compared to 1,503,841 during the nine months ended September
30, 2023. These receipts represent proceeds from the sale of shares of the Company s common stock and common stock purchase warrants,
and the issuance of debt. 

Satisfaction of Our Cash Obligations for the
Next 12 Months 

As of September 30, 2024,
our cash balance was 101,452. Our plan for satisfying our cash requirements for the next twelve months is through a combination of sales-generated
income, including revenue from our installation contracts with the Texas school districts, private placements of our capital stock, exercise
of warrants, third party financing, and/or traditional bank financing. There is no assurance that we will be able to meet our working
capital requirements through the private placement of equity or debt or from any other source. 

24 

Other Funding Arrangements 

On September 28, 2023, (the
 Effective Date ), we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the SPA with Gem Global Yield LLC SCS GEM 
or the Purchaser and Gem Yield Bahamas Limited GYBL ). Pursuant to the SPA, we may sell to the Purchaser
from time to time up to 100,000,000 (the Aggregate Limit in shares of our common stock during the 36 month period after
the first day on which the Company s common stock trades on a nationally recognized United States stock exchange or any other exchange
platform in the world (the Public Listing Date ). Pursuant to the SPA, after the Public Listing Date, the Company may issue
a draw down notice pursuant to which the Company may sell the Purchaser an amount of shares that shall not exceed 400 of the average
daily trading volume for the 30 days immediately preceding the date on which the Company delivers the draw down notice. The per share
price shall equal 90 of the average applicable Daily Closing Price (as defined in the SPA) of the Company s common stock during
the applicable Draw Down Pricing Period (as defined in the SPA). Notwithstanding the foregoing, within five trading days after the Public
Listing Date, the Company may issue a draw down notice for an amount up to 10,000,000 of the Aggregate Limit. Unless earlier terminated
as provided in the SPA, the SPA terminates automatically on the earliest of (i) thirty-six (36) consecutive months after the Public Listing
Date; (ii) thirty-six (36) months from the Effective Date (as may be extended as provided in the SPA), and (iii) the date the Purchaser
shall have purchased the Aggregate Limit. 

Pursuant to the SPA, in consideration
for these services, we agreed to pay GYBL the following consideration: (i) a commitment fee equal to two (2) percent of the Aggregate
Limit (the Commitment Fee payable in cash from the proceeds of the Draw Downs (as defined in the SPA) or in freely tradeable
shares of common stock of the Company valued at the Daily Closing Price (as defined in the SPA) at the time of each Draw Down (as defined
in the SPA), at the option of Wytec, deliverable as described in the SPA so long as the entire Commitment Fee is paid on or before the
first anniversary of the Public Listing Date and (ii) a warrant granting GYBL the right to purchase shares of our common stock having
an expiration date that is the third anniversary of the Public Listing Date at the exercise price and upon the terms set forth more fully
in the SPA, up to the number of shares of common stock that is equal to 3.7 of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding
calculated on a fully diluted basis as of the Public Listing Date (the Warrant ). The Commitment Fee will not be payable
and the Warrant will not be issuable if the Company s common stock does not become publicly listed. 

Pursuant to a Registration
Rights Agreement, dated September 28, 2023, between us and the Purchaser and GYBL (the Registration Rights Agreement ), no
later than thirty (30) calendar days after the Public Listing Date, we are obligated to file a registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC to register the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the SPA. Pursuant to the Registration
Rights Agreement, we are obligated to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC on the earlier of (A) the 45 th 
calendar day after the date on which the registration statement is filed with the SEC and (B) the fifth business day after the date the
Company is notified by the SEC that the registration statement will not be reviewed. 

Other Payable 

During 2019, 895,000 of deferred
revenue, related to amounts billed and collected before services related to registered links and related equipment and services Links previously sold by the Company had been completed, was reclassified to other payable due to the Company exiting the business of installing
Links. Since that time, a total of 560,000 of the amount was exchanged for a total of 119,000 shares of the Company s common stock,
leaving a balance of 335,000 at September 30, 2024. The Company intends to relieve the remaining liability through a combination of exchanges
for common stock and cash. 

Going Concern 

Our financial statements are
prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplate
the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred continuous losses from operations,
have an accumulated deficit of 33,724,898 at September 30, 2024, and have reported negative cash flows from operations. In addition,
we do not currently have the cash resources to meet our operating commitments for the next twelve months from the date of this report.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to
continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, and complications frequently encountered by entrance
into established markets and the competitive nature in which we operate. 

25 

Our ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our cash needs and/or to raise funds to
finance ongoing operations and repay debt. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional
debt or equity capital and/or that our cash generated by our operations will be adequate to meet our needs. These factors, among others,
indicate that we may be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

We have reviewed the standards
issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB through September 30, 2024 and which are not yet effective. Unless
otherwise discussed, the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Company s
financial position or results of operations upon adoption. The Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements
and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncement will have a material impact on its financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
About Market Risk. 

Not Applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, Mr. William Gray, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15I under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that
evaluation, Mr. Gray has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in timely alerting them to material information
relating to us required to be included in our periodic SEC filings and in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file or submit under the Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. The conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective was due to the presence of material weaknesses
in internal control over financial reporting. Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective
until the material weaknesses are remediated. 

Our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. To address the material weaknesses, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures in an effort
to ensure our financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
