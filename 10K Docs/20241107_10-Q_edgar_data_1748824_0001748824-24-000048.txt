 (1) Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are comprised of financial investments managed by the Company s Affiliate. 
 Equity securities and derivatives which are traded on a national securities exchange are stated at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation. To the extent these securities are actively traded and valuation adjustments are not applied, they are classified as Level I. The securities that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices, dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs obtained by the Company from independent pricing services are classified as Level II. 
 The Company obtains prices from independent pricing services that may utilize broker quotes, but generally the independent pricing services will use various other pricing techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other data. The Company has not made adjustments to the prices provided. Assets of consolidated Funds also include investments in Corporate bonds.

million at December 31, 2023 were composed of approximately cash equivalents and equity securities. The Company values these using the published price of the underlying securities (classified as Level I) or quoted price supported by observable inputs as of the measurement date (classified as Level II). 
 (3) Investments related to long-term incentive compensation plans of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were investments in publicly registered daily redeemable funds (some managed by Acadian), which the Company has classified as trading securities and valued using the published price as of the measurement dates. Accordingly, the Company has classified these investments as Level I. 
 (4) The uncategorized amounts of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, relate to investments in unconsolidated Funds which consist primarily of investments in Funds and are valued using NAV which the Company relies on to determine their fair value as a practical expedient and has therefore not classified these investments in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to amounts presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These unconsolidated Funds consist primarily of real estate investment Funds and other investment vehicles. The NAVs that have been provided by investees have been derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the measurement dates. Other investment vehicles are not subject to redemption restrictions. 
 The real estate investment Funds of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were subject to longer than monthly or quarterly redemption restrictions, and due to their nature, distributions are received only as cash flows are generated from underlying assets over the life of the Funds. The range of time over which the underlying assets are expected to be liquidated by the investees is approximately from September 30, 2024. The valuation process for the underlying real estate investments held by the real estate investment Funds begins with each property or loan being valued by the investment teams. The valuations are then reviewed and approved by the valuation committee, which consists of senior members of the portfolio management, finance, and research teams. For certain properties and loans, the valuation process may also include a valuation by independent appraisers. In connection with this process, changes in fair value measurements from period to period are evaluated for reasonableness, considering items such as market rents, capitalization and discount rates, and general economic and market conditions. 
 There were no significant transfers of financial assets or liabilities between Levels II or III during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Other assets of consolidated Funds Total Assets Liabilities Liabilities of consolidated Funds Total Liabilities 
 Investments consist of investments in equity securities, corporate bonds and derivative securities. To the extent the Company also has consolidated Funds that are not VIEs, the assets and liabilities of those Funds are not included in the table above. 
 The assets of consolidated VIEs presented in the table above belong to the investors in those Funds, are available for use only by the Fund to which they belong, and are not available for use by the Company to the extent they are held by non-controlling interests. Any debt or liabilities held by consolidated Funds have no recourse to the Company s general credit. 
 The Company s involvement with Funds that are VIEs and not consolidated by the Company is generally limited to that of an investment manager and its investment in the unconsolidated VIE, if any.

 (1) Fair value approximates carrying value because the credit facility has variable interest rates based on selected short term market rates. 
 (2) On August 29, 2024, Acadian s million revolving credit facility was terminated and replaced with a new million revolving credit facility. 
 (3) The difference between the principal amounts and the carrying values of the senior notes in the table above reflects the unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts.

 Litigation 
 The Company is subject to claims, legal proceedings, and other contingencies in the ordinary course of its business activities. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved in a manner unfavorable to the Company. The Company establishes accruals for matters for which the outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated. As of September 30, 2024, there were no material accruals for claims and the Company does not believe any outstanding matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company.

 million notional Treasury rate lock contracts which were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges. The Company documented its hedging strategy and risk management objective for this contract in anticipation of a future debt issuance.

Overview 
 We are a global asset management holding company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. We operate a differentiated investment management business through our majority owned subsidiary, Acadian Asset Management LLC Acadian or the Affiliate ), a leading systematic manager of active global, international equity and alternative strategies. Acadian comprises our Quant Solutions reportable segment: 
 Quant Solutions comprised of versatile, often highly-tailored strategies that leverage data and technology in a computational, factor-based investment process across a range of asset classes in developed and emerging markets, including global, non-U.S. and small-cap equities, as well as managed volatility, equity alternatives including macro, and credit strategies. This segment is comprised of our interest in our sole Affiliate, Acadian. 
 Through Acadian, we offer a diverse range of actively-managed investment strategies and products to institutional investors around the globe. 
 The corporate head office is included within the Other category. The corporate head office expenses are not allocated to the Company s business segment, but the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM does consider the cost structure of the corporate head office when evaluating the financial performance of our segment. 
 Under U.S. GAAP, Acadian is consolidated into our financial statements. We may also be required to consolidate Acadian s sponsored investment entities, or Funds, due to the nature of our decision-making rights, our economic interests in these Funds or the rights of third party clients in those Funds. 
 The Economics of Our Business 
 Our profitability is affected by a variety of factors including the level and composition of our average assets under management, or AUM, fee rates charged on AUM and our expense structure. We earn management fees based on assets under management. Approximately 80 of our management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were calculated based on average AUM (calculated on either a daily or monthly basis) with the remainder of our management fees calculated based on period-end AUM. Changes in the levels of our AUM are driven by market investment performance and net client cash flows. We may also earn performance fees when certain accounts differ in relation to relevant benchmarks or exceed or fail to exceed required returns. Approximately 20 billion, or 16 , of our AUM are in accounts with incentive fee features in which we participate in the performance fee. The majority of these performance fees are calculated based on value added over the relevant benchmarks on a rolling one-year basis. 
 Our largest expense item is compensation and benefits paid to our employees, which consists of both fixed and variable components. Fixed compensation and benefits represents base salaries and wages, payroll taxes and the costs of our employee benefit programs. Variable compensation, calculated as described below, may be awarded in cash, equity, or profit interests. 
 The arrangement in place with Acadian results in the sharing of economics between BSUS and Acadian s key management personnel using a profit-sharing model. Profit sharing affects two elements within our earnings: (i) the calculation of variable compensation and (ii) the level of Acadian s equity or profit interests distribution to its employees. 
 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 Variable compensation is the portion of earnings that is contractually allocated to Acadian employees as a bonus pool, typically representing a percentage of earnings before variable compensation, which is measured as revenues less fixed compensation and benefits and other operating and administrative expenses. Profits after variable compensation are shared between us and Acadian key employee equity holders according to our respective equity or profit interests ownership. The sharing of profits in this manner ensures that the economic interests of Acadian key employees and those of BSUS are aligned, both in terms of generating strong annual earnings as well as investing those earnings back into the business in order to generate growth over the long term. We view profit sharing as an attractive operating model, as it allows us to share in the benefits of operating leverage as the business grows, and ensures all equity and profit interests holders are incentivized to achieve that growth. 
 Equity or profit interests owned by Acadian key employees are awarded as part of their variable compensation arrangement. Over time, Acadian key employee-owned equity or profit interests are recycled from one generation of employee-owners to the next, either by the next generation purchasing equity or profit interests directly from retiring principals, or by Acadian key employees forgoing cash bonuses in exchange for the equivalent value in Acadian equity or profit interests. The recycling of equity or profit interests is often facilitated by BSUS; see U.S. GAAP Results of Operations U.S. GAAP Expenses Compensation and Benefits Expense for a further discussion. 
 How We Measure Performance 
 We manage our business based on one segment, reflecting how our management assesses the performance of our business. 
 In measuring and monitoring the key components of our earnings, our management uses a non-GAAP financial measure, ENI, to evaluate the financial performance of, and to make operational decisions for, our business. We also use ENI to make resource allocation decisions, determine appropriate levels of investment or dividend payout, manage balance sheet leverage, determine variable compensation and Affiliate equity distributions, and incentivize management. It is an important measure in evaluating our financial performance because we believe it most accurately represents our operating performance and cash generation capability. 
 ENI differs from net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a result of both the reclassification of certain income statement items and the exclusion of certain non-cash or non-recurring income statement items. In particular, ENI excludes non-cash charges representing the changes in the value of Affiliate equity and profit interests held by Affiliate key employees, the results of discontinued operations which are no longer part of our business, restructuring costs, capital transaction costs, seed capital and co-investment gains, losses and related financing costs and that portion of consolidated Funds which are not attributable to our stockholders. 
 ENI revenue is primarily comprised of the fee revenues paid to us by our clients for our advisory services. Revenue included within ENI differs from U.S. GAAP revenue in that it excludes amounts from consolidated Funds which are not attributable to our stockholders. 
 ENI expenses are calculated to reflect all usual expenses from ongoing continuing operations attributable to our stockholders. Expenses included within ENI differ from U.S. GAAP expenses in that they exclude amounts from consolidated Funds which are not attributable to our stockholders, revaluations of Affiliate key employee owned equity and profit interests, amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles and other acquisition-related items, and certain other non-cash expenses. 
 Non-controlling interests is a concept under U.S. GAAP that identifies net components of revenues and expenses that are not attributable to our stockholders. For example, the portion of the net income (loss) of any consolidated Fund that is attributable to the outside investors or clients of the consolidated Fund is included in Non-controlling interests in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Conversely, controlling interests is the portion of revenue or expense that is attributable to our stockholders. 
 For a more detailed discussion of the differences between U.S. GAAP net income and economic net income, see Non-GAAP Supplemental Performance Measure Economic Net Income and Segment Analysis.

 (1) U.S. GAAP operating margin equals operating income divided by total revenue. 
 (2) Economic net income is a non-GAAP measure we use to evaluate the performance of our business. For a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP financial information and a further discussion of economic net income refer to Non-GAAP Supplemental Performance Measure Economic Net Income and Segment Analysis. 
 (3) Excludes severance-related items at Acadian of (0.3) million and costs associated with the transfer of an insurance policy from our former parent of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Excludes costs associated with the transfer of an insurance policy from our former parent of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excludes severance-related items at Acadian of (0.8) million, costs associated with the transfer of an insurance policy from our former Parent of 0.9 million, and costs associated with the wind-down of the MACS business in the standalone format of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Excludes costs associated with the transfer of an insurance policy from our former parent of 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 (4) ENI revenue is the ENI measure which corresponds to U.S. GAAP revenue. 
 (5) Pre-tax economic net income is the ENI measure which corresponds to U.S. GAAP pre-tax income attributable to controlling interests.

 (6) ENI operating margin is a non-GAAP efficiency measure, calculated based on ENI operating earnings divided by ENI revenue. ENI operating earnings is calculated as ENI revenue, less ENI operating expense, less ENI variable compensation. The ENI operating margin is most directly comparable to our U.S. GAAP operating margin (excluding the effect of consolidated Funds). 
 (7) Economic net income is the non-GAAP measure which is most directly comparable to U.S. GAAP net income attributable to controlling interests. 
 (8) Annualized revenue impact of net flows represents annualized management fees expected to be earned on new accounts and net assets contributed to existing accounts, less the annualized management fees lost on terminated accounts or net assets withdrawn from existing accounts, plus revenue impact from reinvested income and distributions. The annualized management fees are calculated by multiplying the annual gross fee rate for the relevant account by the net assets gained in the account in the event of a positive flow, excluding any current or future market appreciation or depreciation, or the net assets lost in the account in the event of an outflow, excluding any current or future market appreciation or depreciation. In addition, reinvested income and distributions are multiplied by the average fee rate to compute the revenue impact. For a further discussion of the uses and limitations of the annualized revenue impact of net flows, see Assets Under Management herein.

 AUM flows and the annualized revenue impact of net flows 
 Net client cash flows and revenue impact of net client cash flows for all periods include reinvested income and distributions. Reinvested income and distributions represent investment yield that is reinvested back into the portfolios as opposed to distributed as cash. 
 In the following table, we present our asset flows and market appreciation (depreciation) by segment. We also present a key metric used to better understand our asset flows, the annualized revenue impact of net client cash flows. Annualized revenue impact of net flows represents annualized management fees expected to be earned on new accounts and net assets contributed to existing accounts (inflows), less the annualized management fees lost on terminated accounts or net assets withdrawn from existing accounts (outflows), plus revenue impact from reinvested income and distributions. Annualized management fee for client flow is calculated by multiplying the annual gross fee rate for the relevant account with the inflow or the outflow. In addition, reinvested income and distributions is multiplied by the average fee rate to compute the revenue impact. 
 The annualized revenue impact of net flows metric is designed to provide investors with a better indication of the potential financial impact of net client cash flows, however it has certain limitations. For instance, it does not include assumptions for the next twelve months' market appreciation or depreciation and investment performance associated with the assets gained or lost. Nor does it account for factors such as future client terminations or additional contributions or withdrawals over the next twelve months. Additionally, the basis points reported are fee rates based on the asset levels at the time of the transactions and do not consider the fact that client fee rates may change over the next twelve months.

 At September 30, 2024, our total assets under management were 120.3 billion, an increase of 7.7 billion, or 6.8 , compared to 112.6 billion at June 30, 2024 and an increase of 22.9 billion, or 23.5 , compared to 97.4 billion at September 30, 2023. The increase in assets under management compared to September 30, 2023 was driven by the equity market appreciation in the last twelve months. The change in assets under management during the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects net market appreciation of 7.2 billion, and net inflows of 0.5 billion. The change in assets under management during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects net market appreciation of 15.7 billion and net inflows of 0.9 billion. Market appreciation or depreciation reported in current and prior periods includes changes in equity prices, as well as the impact from exchange rate fluctuations on our foreign-denominated AUM. Given a substantial portion of our AUM is denominated in foreign currencies, foreign exchange rate movements during the period can impact AUM when the strength of the U.S. dollar changes relative to other currencies.

 U.S. GAAP Revenues 
 Our U.S. GAAP revenues principally consist of: 
 i. management fees earned based on our overall weighted average fee rate charged to our clients and the level of assets under management; 
 ii. performance fees earned when our Affiliate s investment performance over agreed time periods for certain clients has differed from pre-determined hurdles; and 
 iii. revenue from consolidated Funds, a portion of which is attributable to the holders of non-controlling interests in consolidated Funds. 
 Management Fees 
 Our management fees are a function of the fee rates charged to our clients, which are typically expressed in basis points, and the levels of our assets under management. 
 Average basis points earned on average assets under management were 38.3 bps and 38.4 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 37.6 bps and 37.9 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall weighted average fee rate increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is the result of changes in the mix of assets under management caused by market movements and client flows. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023: Management fees increased 16.8 million, or 17.6 , from 95.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 112.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was mainly driven by higher levels of average assets under management. Average assets under management increased 15.8 , from 100.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 116.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, mainly due to the positive equity market impact in the past twelve months. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023: Management fees increased 41.1 million, or 14.7 , from 278.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 319.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by higher levels of average assets under management. Average assets under management increase 12.8 , from 98.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 110.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, mainly due to the positive equity market in the past twelve months. 
 Performance Fees 
 Approximately 20 billion, or 16 of our AUM, were in accounts with performance fee features in which we participate. Performance fees are typically shared with our Affiliate key employees through various contractual compensation and profit-sharing arrangements.

Table of Contents 

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023: Performance fees decreased (1.1) million, from 11.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a change in performance relative to benchmarks in certain strategies. Performance fees can be variable and are contractually triggered based on investment performance results over agreed upon time periods. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023: Performance fees increased 2.1 million, from 13.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to strong performance relative to benchmarks in certain strategies. Performance fees are variable and are contractually triggered based on investment performance results over agreed upon time periods. 
 U.S. GAAP Expenses 
 Our U.S. GAAP expenses principally consist of: 
 i. compensation paid to our investment professionals and other employees, including base salary, benefits, sales-based compensation, variable compensation, Affiliate distributions, and revaluation of key employee owned Affiliate equity and profit interests; 
 ii. general and administrative expenses; 
 iii. depreciation and amortization charges; and 
 iv. expenses of consolidated Funds, a portion of which is attributable to the holders of non-controlling interests in consolidated Funds. 
 Compensation and Benefits Expense 
 Our most significant category of expense is compensation and benefits awarded to our and our Affiliate s employees. The following table presents the components of U.S. GAAP compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Fixed compensation and benefits (1) 
 24.5 23.1 72.3 70.2 Sales-based compensation (2) 
 3.3 1.2 6.9 4.7 Variable compensation (3) 
 29.4 28.5 83.7 74.4 Affiliate key employee distributions (4) 
 3.1 1.5 7.4 3.9 Non-cash Affiliate key employee equity revaluations (5) 
 9.3 (1.3) 19.6 (2.6) Total U.S. GAAP compensation and benefits expense 
 69.6 53.0 189.9 150.6 
 
 (1) Fixed compensation and benefits includes base salaries, payroll taxes and the cost of benefit programs provided. 
 (2) Sales-based compensation is paid to our Affiliate s sales and distribution teams and represents compensation earned by our sales professionals, paid over a multi-year period, related to revenue earned on new sales. Its variability is based upon the structure of sales-based compensation due on inflows of assets under management and market-based movement in both current and prior periods.

 (3) Variable compensation is contractually set and calculated individually for our Affiliate, plus Center bonuses. Variable compensation is usually awarded based on a contractual percentage of Affiliate ENI profits before variable compensation and may be paid in the form of cash or non-cash Affiliate equity or profit interests. With our Affiliate, we have a contractual split of performance fees between Affiliate employees and BSUS. The Affiliate s share of performance fees, which ranges between 60 -75 of the total, is allocated entirely to variable compensation. The variable compensation earned on performance fees vests over three-years and compensation expense is recognized over that service period. Center variable compensation includes cash and our equity. Non-cash variable compensation awards typically vest over several years and are recognized as compensation expense over that service period.

 29.4 28.5 83.7 74.4 
 
 (a) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 29.6 million and 83.6 million, respectively, of variable compensation expense (of the 29.4 million and 83.7 million above) is included within economic net income. The three months ended September 30, 2024 excludes (0.3) million of severance-related items at Acadian. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 excludes (0.8) million of severance-related items at Acadian and costs associated with the wind-down of the MACS business in the standalone format of 0.9 million. 
 (4) Affiliate key employee distributions represent the share of Affiliate profits after variable compensation that is attributable to Affiliate key employee equity and profit interests holders, according to their ownership interests. The Affiliate key employee distribution ratio at our Affiliate is calculated as Affiliate key employee distributions divided by ENI operating earnings at the Affiliate. Within our Affiliate we have a tiered equity structure, where BSUS and other classes of employee equity holders are entitled to an initial proportionate preference over profits after variable compensation, structured such that before a preference threshold is reached, there would be no required key employee distributions to the tiered equity holders, whereas for profits above the threshold, the key employee distribution amount to the tiered equity holders would be calculated based on the tiered key employee ownership percentages. 
 (5) Non-cash Affiliate key employee equity revaluations represent changes in the value of Affiliate equity and profit interests held by Affiliate key employees. These ownership interests may in certain circumstances be repurchased by BSUS at a value based on a pre-determined fixed multiple of twelve-month earnings and as such a liability is carried on our balance sheet based on the expected cash to be paid. However, any equity or profit interests repurchased by BSUS can be used to fund a portion of future variable compensation awards, resulting in savings in cash variable compensation that offset the negative cash effect of repurchasing the equity. Our Affiliate equity and profit interest plans have been designed to ensure BSUS is not required to repurchase more equity than we can reasonably recycle through variable compensation awards in any given twelve-month period. 
 Fluctuations in compensation and benefits expense for the periods presented are discussed below.

Table of Contents 

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023: Compensation and benefits expense increased 16.6 million, or 31.3 , from 53.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 69.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Fixed compensation and benefits increased 1.4 million, or 6.1 , from 23.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 24.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting the cost of new hires supporting our growth initiatives, and cost of living increases, partially offset by cost savings realized from restructuring at our Affiliate in late 2023. Variable compensation increased 0.9 million, or 3.2 , from 28.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 29.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to higher pre-bonus profits in the three months ended September 30, 2024 at our Affiliate, partially offset by changes in deferred compensation expense earned on current and prior year performance fee revenues, of which the Affiliate s share is determined by a contractual split and recognized as compensation expense over a vesting period. The deferred nature of the bonus earned on performance fee revenues can result in compensation expense variability that is uncorrelated to current period earnings. Sales-based compensation increased 2.1 million, or 175.0 , from 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of the structure of sales-based compensation programs, driven by the timing of asset inflows which trigger sales-based compensation in both current and prior periods. Affiliate key employee distributions increased 1.6 million, or 106.7 , from 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Affiliate key employee distributions for certain tiers of equity are calculated after an earnings threshold is met, whereby no distributions are made to these equity holders when earnings are below the threshold. The change in Affiliate key employee distributions during the current period is driven by higher operating earnings in the current period and the leveraged nature of this distribution share. Revaluations of Affiliate equity changed by 10.6 million, reflecting fluctuations in the value of key employee ownership interests at our consolidated Affiliate, as the value of Affiliate equity decreased (1.3) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For certain tiers of Affiliate equity, revaluations are calculated based on earnings above a threshold. The change in the revaluation in the current period is driven by higher earnings period over period, including earnings over the threshold for certain Affiliate equity. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023: Compensation and benefits expense increased 39.3 million, or 26.1 , from 150.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 189.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Fixed compensation and benefits increased 2.1 million, or 3.0 , from 70.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 72.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting the cost of new hires supporting our growth initiatives and cost of living increases, partially offset by cost savings realized from restructuring at our Affiliate in late 2023. Variable compensation increased 9.3 million, or 12.5 , from 74.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 83.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to higher pre-bonus profits in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 at our Affiliate, partially offset by changes in deferred compensation expense earned on current and prior year performance fee revenues, of which the Affiliate s share is determined by a contractual split and recognized as compensation expense over a vesting period. The deferred nature of the bonus earned on performance fee revenues can result in compensation expense variability that is uncorrelated to current period earnings. Sales-based compensation increased 2.2 million or 46.8 from 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of the structure of sales-based compensation programs, driven by the timing of asset inflows which trigger sales-based compensation in both current and prior periods. Affiliate key employee distributions increased 3.5 million, or 89.7 , from 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Affiliate key employee distributions for certain tiers of equity are calculated after an earnings threshold is met, whereby no distributions are made to these equity holders when earnings are below the threshold. The change in Affiliate key employee distributions during the current period is driven by higher operating earnings and the leveraged nature of this distribution share. Revaluations of Affiliate equity changed 22.2 million, reflecting fluctuations in the value of key employee ownership interests at our consolidated Affiliate, as the value of Affiliate equity decreased (2.6) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 19.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For certain tiers of Affiliate equity, revaluations are calculated based on earnings above a threshold. The change in the revaluation in the current period is driven by higher earnings period over period, including earnings over the threshold for certain Affiliate equity.

 U.S. GAAP Income Tax Expense 
 Our effective tax rate has been impacted by state and local tax obligations, changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions, tax effects of stock-based compensation, limitations on executive compensation, and the mix of income earned in the United States versus foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be impacted in the future by these items as well as further changes in tax laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023: Income tax expense increased 1.7 million, from 7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Non-GAAP Supplemental Performance Measure Economic Net Income and Segment Analysis 
 As supplemental information, we provide a non-GAAP performance measure that we refer to as economic net income, or ENI, which represents our management s view of the underlying economic earnings generated by us. We define economic net income as ENI revenue less (i) ENI operating expenses, (ii) variable compensation, (iii) key employee distributions, (iv) net interest and (v) taxes, each as further discussed in this section. ENI adjustments to U.S. GAAP include both reclassifications of U.S. GAAP revenue and expense items, as well as adjustments to U.S. GAAP results, primarily to exclude non-cash, non-economic expenses, or to reflect cash benefits not recognized under U.S. GAAP. 
 ENI is an important measure to investors because it is used by us to make resource allocation decisions, determine appropriate levels of investment or dividend payout, manage balance sheet leverage, determine Affiliate variable compensation and equity distributions, and incentivize management. It is also an important measure because it assists management in evaluating our operating performance and is presented in a way that most closely reflects the key elements of our profit share operating model with our Affiliate. For a further discussion of how we use ENI and why ENI is useful to investors, see Overview How We Measure Performance.

 To calculate economic net income, we re-categorize certain line items on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations to reflect the following: 
 We exclude the effect of Funds consolidation by removing the portion of Fund revenues, expenses and investment return which were not attributable to our stockholders. 
 We include within management fee revenue any fees paid to our Affiliate by consolidated Funds. 
 We include our share of earnings from our equity-accounted Affiliate within other income in ENI revenue, rather than investment income. 
 We treat sales-based compensation as a general and administrative expense, rather than part of fixed compensation and benefits. 
 We identify separately from operating expenses variable compensation and Affiliate key employee distributions, which represent Affiliate earnings shared with Affiliate key employees. 
 We also make the following adjustments to U.S. GAAP results to more closely reflect our economic results: 
 i. We exclude non-cash expenses representing changes in the value of Affiliate equity and profit interests held by Affiliate key employees. These ownership interests may in certain circumstances be repurchased by BSUS at a value based on a pre-determined fixed multiple of trailing earnings and as such this value is carried on our balance sheet as a liability. Non-cash movements in the value of this liability are treated as compensation expense under U.S. GAAP. However, any equity or profit interests repurchased by BSUS can be used to fund a portion of future variable compensation awards, resulting in savings in cash variable compensation that offset the negative cash effect of repurchasing the equity. Our Affiliate equity and profit interest plans have been designed to ensure BSUS is never required to repurchase more equity than we can reasonably recycle through variable compensation awards in any given twelve-month period. 
 ii. We exclude non-cash amortization or impairment expenses related to acquired goodwill and other intangibles as these are non-cash charges that do not result in an outflow of tangible economic benefits from the business. 
 iii. We exclude capital transaction costs, including the costs of raising debt or equity, gains or losses realized as a result of redeeming debt or equity and direct incremental costs associated with acquisitions of businesses or assets. 
 iv. We exclude seed capital and co-investment gains, losses, and related financing costs. The net returns on these investments are considered and presented separately from ENI because ENI is primarily a measure of our earnings from managing client assets, which therefore differs from earnings generated by our investments in Affiliate products, which can be variable from period to period. 
 v. We include cash tax benefits associated with deductions allowed for acquired intangibles and goodwill that may not be recognized or have timing differences compared to U.S. GAAP. 
 vi. We exclude the results of discontinued operations attributable to controlling interests since they are not part of our ongoing business and restructuring costs incurred in continuing operations. 
 vii. We exclude deferred tax resulting from changes in tax law and expiration of statutes, adjustments for uncertain tax positions, deferred tax attributable to intangible assets and other unusual items not related to current operating results to reflect ENI tax normalization. 
 We also adjust our income tax expense to reflect any tax impact of our ENI adjustments.

 Limitations of Economic Net Income 
 Economic net income is the key measure our management uses to evaluate the financial performance of, and make operational decisions for, our business. Economic net income is not audited and is not a substitute for net income or other performance measures that are derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Furthermore, our calculation of economic net income may differ from similarly titled measures provided by other companies. 
 Because the calculation of economic net income excludes certain ongoing expenses, including amortization expense and certain compensation costs, it has certain material limitations and should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures of earnings.

 ENI Operating Expenses 
 The largest difference between U.S. GAAP operating expense and ENI operating expense relates to compensation. As shown in the following reconciliation, we exclude the impact of key employee equity revaluations. Variable compensation and Affiliate key employee distributions are also segregated out of U.S. GAAP operating expense in order to align with the manner in which these items are contractually calculated at the Affiliate level.

 Key Non-GAAP Operating Metrics 
 The following table shows our key non-GAAP operating metrics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We present these metrics because they are the measures our management uses to evaluate the profitability of our business and are useful to investors because they represent the key drivers and measures of economic performance within our business model. Please see the footnotes below for an explanation of each ratio, its usefulness in measuring the economics and operating performance of our business, and a reference to the most closely related U.S. GAAP measure:

 (a) The three months ended September 30, 2024 includes (0.3) million of severance-related items at Acadian and 0.3 million costs associated with the transfer of an insurance policy from our former parent. The three months ended September 30, 2023 includes 0.3 million of costs associated with the transfer of an insurance policy from our former parent. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes (0.8) million of severance-related items at Acadian, 0.9 million of costs associated with the transfer of an insurance policy from our former parent, and costs associated with the wind-down of the MACS business in the standalone format of 1.3 million. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes 0.9 million of costs associated with the transfer of an insurance policy from our former parent. 
 (b) The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 excludes (0.3) million and (0.8) million, respectively, of severance-related items at Acadian. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 excludes 0.9 million of costs associated with the wind-down of the MACS business in the standalone format. 
 (2) The ENI operating margin, which is calculated before Affiliate key employee distributions, is used by management and is useful to investors to evaluate the overall operating margin of the business. The ENI operating margin is most comparable to our U.S. GAAP operating margin. Our U.S. GAAP operating margin, excluding the effect of consolidated Funds, is 21.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, 28.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, 20.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 24.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The ENI operating margin is important because it gives investors an understanding of the profitability of the total business relative to revenue, irrespective of the ownership position which we have in our Affiliate. Management and investors use this ratio when comparing our profitability relative to our peer group and evaluating our ability to manage the cost structure and profitability of our business under different operating environments. 
 (3) ENI management fee revenue corresponds to U.S. GAAP management fee revenue.

Table of Contents 

 (4) The ENI operating expense ratio is used by management and is useful to investors to evaluate the level of operating expense as measured against our recurring management fee revenue. We have provided this ratio since many operating expenses, including fixed compensation and benefits and general and administrative expense, are generally linked to the overall size of the business. We track this ratio as a key measure of scale economies because in our profit-sharing economic model, scale benefits both the Affiliate employees and our stockholders. The ENI operating expense ratio is most comparable to the U.S. GAAP operating expense / management fee revenue ratio. 
 (5) ENI earnings before variable compensation is calculated as ENI revenue, less ENI operating expense. 
 (6) The ENI variable compensation ratio is used by management and is useful to investors to evaluate consolidated variable compensation as measured against our ENI earnings before variable compensation. Variable compensation is contractually set and calculated individually at our Affiliate, plus Center bonuses. Variable compensation is usually awarded based on a contractual percentage of our Affiliate s ENI earnings before variable compensation and may be paid in the form of cash or non-cash Affiliate equity or profit interests. Center variable compensation includes cash and our equity. Non-cash variable compensation awards typically vest over several years and are recognized as compensation expense over that service period. The variable compensation ratio at our Affiliate is calculated as variable compensation divided by ENI earnings before variable compensation. The ENI variable compensation ratio is most comparable to the U.S. GAAP variable compensation ratio. 
 (7) The ENI Affiliate key employee distribution ratio is used by management and is useful to investors to evaluate Affiliate key employee distributions as measured against our ENI operating earnings. Affiliate key employee distributions represent the share of Affiliate profits after variable compensation that is attributable to Affiliate key employee equity and profit interests holders, according to their ownership interests. The Affiliate key employee distribution ratio at our Affiliate is calculated as Affiliate key employee distributions divided by ENI operating earnings at that Affiliate. Within our Affiliate, we have a tiered equity structure, where BSUS and other classes of employee equity holders are entitled to an initial proportionate preference over profits after variable compensation, structured such that before a preference threshold is reached, there would be no required key employee distributions to the tiered equity holders, whereas for profits above the threshold the key employee distribution amount to the tiered equity holders would be calculated based on the tiered key employee ownership percentages. The ENI Affiliate key employee distributions ratio is most comparable to the U.S. GAAP Affiliate key employee distributions ratio.

 Segment Analysis 
 We operate our business through the following reportable segment: 
 Quant Solutions comprised of versatile, often highly-tailored strategies that leverage data and technology in a computational, factor-based investment process across a range of asset classes in developed and emerging markets, including global, non-U.S. and small-cap equities, as well as managed volatility, equity alternatives including macro, and credit strategies. This segment is comprised of our interest in Acadian. 
 
 The corporate head office is included within the Other category. The corporate head office expenses are not allocated to the Company s business segment but the CODM does consider the cost structure of the corporate head office when evaluating the financial performance of our segment. 
 The primary measure used by the CODM in measuring performance and allocating resources to the segment is ENI. We define economic net income for the segments as ENI revenue less (i) ENI operating expenses, (ii) variable compensation and (iii) key employee distributions. The ENI adjustments to U.S. GAAP include both reclassifications of U.S. GAAP revenue and expense items, as well as adjustments to U.S. GAAP results, primarily to exclude non-cash, non-economic expenses, or to reflect cash benefits not recognized under U.S. GAAP. 
 ENI revenue includes management fees, performance fees and other revenue under U.S. GAAP, adjusted to include management fees paid to our Affiliate by consolidated Funds. 
 ENI operating expenses include compensation and benefits, general and administrative expense, and depreciation and amortization under U.S. GAAP, adjusted to exclude non-cash expenses representing changes in the value of Affiliate equity and profit interests held by Affiliate key employees, capital transaction costs, and restructuring costs. Additionally, variable compensation and Affiliate key employee distributions are segregated from ENI operating expenses. 
 ENI segment results are also adjusted to exclude the portion of consolidated Funds revenues, expenses and investment return recorded under U.S. GAAP. 
 Refer to the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP revenue to ENI revenue, U.S. GAAP Operating expense to ENI Operating expense, variable compensation and Affiliate key employee distributions disclosed previously within this section.

 Quant Solutions Segment ENI Expense 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023: Quant Solutions ENI operating expense increased 5.9 million, or 13.4 , from 44.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 49.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was driven by 26.1 higher ENI general and administrative expense reflecting the impact of foreign currency changes, higher systems and portfolio administration costs, and our continued investment in growth initiatives and capabilities. Quant Solutions ENI fixed compensation and benefits expense increased 5.6 , reflecting the cost of new hires supporting our growth initiatives and cost of living increases, partially offset by cost savings realized from restructuring at our Affiliate in late 2023. Quant Solutions ENI variable compensation expense is based on contractual percentage of earnings before variable compensation, and also includes a formulaic split of performance fee revenue that gets deferred and recognized as variable compensation expense over a three-year vesting period. The deferred nature of the bonus earned on performance fee revenues can result in compensation expense variability that is uncorrelated to current period earnings. Quant Solutions ENI variable compensation expense increased 4.3 as a result of higher earnings before variable compensation, partially offset by changes in deferred compensation expense earned on current and prior year performance fee revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Affiliate key employee distributions attributable to Quant Solutions increased 106.7 . Affiliate key employee distributions for certain tiers of equity are calculated after an earnings threshold is met, whereby no distributions are made to these equity holders when earnings are below the threshold. The change in Affiliate key employee distributions during the current period is driven by higher operating earnings and the leveraged nature of this distribution share. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023: Quant Solutions ENI operating expense increased 8.4 million, or 6.2 , from 134.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 143.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was driven by 9.8 higher ENI general and administrative expense primarily due to higher outside services, systems, and portfolio administrative costs, reflecting our continued investment in growth initiatives and capabilities, partially offset by lower consultant costs. Quant Solutions ENI fixed compensation and benefits expense increased 2.8 , reflecting the cost of new hires supporting our growth initiatives and cost of living increases, partially offset by cost savings realized from restructuring in late 2023. Quant Solutions ENI variable compensation expense is based on contractual percentage of earnings before variable compensation, and also includes a formulaic split of performance fee revenue that gets deferred and recognized as variable compensation expense over a three-year vesting period. The deferred nature of the bonus earned on performance fee revenues can result in compensation expense variability that is uncorrelated to current period earnings. Quant Solutions ENI variable compensation expense increased 13.1 as a result of higher earnings before variable compensation, partially offset by changes in deferred compensation expense earned on current and prior year performance fee revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Affiliate key employee distributions attributable to Quant Solutions increased 89.7 . Affiliate key employee distributions for certain tiers of equity are calculated after an earnings threshold is met, whereby no distributions are made to these equity holders when earnings are below the threshold. The change in Affiliate key employee distributions during the current period is driven by higher operating earnings and the leveraged nature of this distribution share.

 Other ENI Expense 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023: Other ENI operating expense increased 0.6 million, or 17.6 , from 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was driven by 22.2 higher general and administrative expense driven by an increase in legal costs. Other ENI variable compensation expense decreased (14.3) due to lower non-cash equity compensation amortization at the corporate head office. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023: Other ENI operating expense increased 0.8 million, or 7.4 , from 10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was driven by 8.8 higher general and administrative expense driven by an increase in legal costs and 5.9 higher fixed compensation and benefit expense due to cost of living and employee benefit increases driven by inflation. Other ENI variable compensation expense decreased (14.3) due to lower non-cash equity compensation amortization at the corporate head office.

 (1) Excludes consolidated Funds. 
 Comparison for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net cash from operating activities increased 23.3 million, from net cash provided of 35.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to net cash provided of 59.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven by changes in net income offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities period-over-period. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash from investing activities changed by (37.1) million, from (11.2) million used in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to (48.3) million used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven by higher net purchases of investment securities and lower fixed asset additions in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash from financing activities decreased 114.3 million, from 10.2 million provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to (104.1) million used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the repayment of revolving credit facility borrowings and higher share repurchases in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Supplemental Liquidity Measure Adjusted EBITDA 
 As supplemental information, we provide information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as economic net income before net interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP liquidity measure that we provide in addition to, but not as a substitute for, cash flows from operating activities. It should be noted that our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be consistent with Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by other companies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful liquidity metric because it indicates our ability to make further investments in our business, service debt and meet working capital requirements.

The three months ended September 30, 2023 includes 0.3 million of costs associated with the transfer of an insurance policy from our former parent. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes (0.8) million of severance-related items at Acadian, 0.9 million of costs associated with the transfer of an insurance policy from our former parent, and costs associated with the wind-down of the MACS business in the standalone format of 0.9 million. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes costs associated with the transfer of an insurance policy from our former parent of 0.9 million. 
 (2) Includes non-cash equity-based award amortization expense. 
 Limitations of Adjusted EBITDA 
 As a non-GAAP, unaudited liquidity measure and derivation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA has certain material limitations. It does not include cash costs associated with capital transactions and excludes certain U.S. GAAP expenses that fall outside the definition of EBITDA. Each of these categories of expense represents costs to us of doing business, and therefore any measure that excludes any or all of these categories of expense has material limitations. 
 Future Capital Needs 
 We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents to be generated from operations, supplemented by short-term and long-term financing, as necessary, will be sufficient to fund current operations and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months, as well as our day-to-day operations and future investment requirements. Our ability to secure short-term and long-term financing in the future will depend on several factors, including our future profitability, our relative levels of debt and equity and the overall condition of the credit markets.

 (1) On August 29, 2024, Acadian s 125 million revolving credit facility was terminated and replaced with a new 140 million revolving credit facility. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On August 29, 2024, Acadian, Royal Bank of Canada, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., the Bank of New York Mellon, Bank of America N.A., as an issuing bank, and Citibank, N.A., as an issuing bank and administrative agent (collectively, the Lenders ), entered into a new revolving credit facility agreement (the Acadian Credit Agreement ), which replaced Acadian s revolving credit facility dated as of March 7, 2022 (the Prior Credit Agreement ). The maturity date of the Prior Credit Agreement was March 7, 2025, and the maturity date of the Acadian Credit Agreement is August 29, 2027. 
 Borrowings under the Acadian Credit Agreement bear interest, at Acadian s option, at the per annum rate equal to either (a) the greatest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 and (iii) the secured overnight financing rate for a one month period plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1 , plus, in each case an additional amount ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 , with such additional amount based on Acadian s Leverage Ratio (as defined below) or (b) Adjusted Term SOFR plus an additional amount ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 , with such additional amount based on Acadian s Leverage Ratio. In addition, Acadian is charged a commitment fee based on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility under the Acadian Credit Agreement at a per annum rate ranging from 0.25 to 0.375 , with such amount based on Acadian s Leverage Ratio. 
 Under the Acadian Credit Agreement, the ratio of Acadian s third-party borrowings to Acadian s trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by the Acadian Credit Agreement (the Leverage Ratio ), cannot exceed 2.5x and the ratio of Acadian s trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA to Acadian s interest expense (the Interest Coverage Ratio must be not less than 4.0x. At September 30, 2024, Acadian s Leverage Ratio was 0.0x and Acadian s Interest Coverage Ratio was 69.8x.

 Other Compensation Liabilities 
 Other compensation liabilities principally consist of cash-settled Affiliate equity and profit interests liabilities held by certain Affiliate key employees, and voluntary deferred compensation plans. The following table summarizes our other compensation liabilities as of each of the dates indicated: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 in millions) Share-based payments liability 20.5 23.0 Affiliate profit interests liability 18.5 Employee equity 39.0 23.0 Voluntary deferral plan liability 48.6 44.5 Total 87.6 67.5 
 Share-based payments liability represents the value of Affiliate key employee-owned equity that may under certain circumstances be repurchased by us that is considered an equity award under U.S. GAAP based on the terms and conditions attached to these interests. Affiliate profit interests liability represents the value of Affiliate key employee-owned equity that may under certain circumstances be repurchased by us that is not considered an equity award under U.S. GAAP, but rather a form of compensation arrangement, based on the terms and conditions attached to these interests. Our obligation in any given period in respect of funding these potential repurchases of Affiliate equity is limited to only that portion that may be put to us by Affiliate key employees, which is typically capped annually under the terms of these arrangements such that we are not required to repurchase more than we can reasonably recycle by re-granting the interests in lieu of cash variable compensation owed to Affiliate key employees. 
 Certain of our and Acadian s key employees are eligible to participate in our voluntary deferral plan, or VDP, which provides our senior personnel the opportunity to voluntarily defer a portion of their compensation. There is a voluntary deferral plan investment balance included in investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets that corresponds to this deferral liability. 
 Additionally, we have recorded accrued incentive compensation of 84.0 million and 101.3 million on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Included within the accrued incentive compensation balance is the vested portion of Acadian s deferred compensation pool. Acadian s deferred compensation pool is based on a contractual percentage of Acadian performance fee revenues and post-bonus profits, and is subject to a three-year vesting period. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Unamortized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the deferred compensation pool of 4.7 million, 12.5 million and 2.4 million is expected to be recognized in the years ending December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our most recent Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and would therefore be deemed the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as an asset manager. Substantially all of our investment management revenues are derived from our agreements with our clients. Under these agreements, the revenues we receive are based on the value of our assets under management or the investment performance on client accounts for which we earn performance fees. Accordingly, our revenues and net income may decline as a result of our assets under management decreasing due to depreciation of our investment portfolios. In addition, such depreciation could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk, which would cause our revenues and net income to decline further. 
 Our model for assessing the impact of market risk on our results uses September 30, 2024 ending AUM and management fee rates as the basis for management fee revenue calculations. With respect to performance fee revenue, we assume that relative investment performance is the same as in the past four quarters ended September 30, 2024. Therefore, market-driven changes in performance fees, which are typically based on relative performance versus market indices, reflect changes in the underlying AUM used in the calculation rather than differences in relative performance as a result of a changed market environment. The impact that market changes have on performance fee eligible accounts varies due to high-water marks and other measurement hurdles which are not factored in this analysis. Changes in performance fee revenues could be significant in each period. The basis for the analysis is performance fees earned for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our profit sharing economic structure, described more fully in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation The Economics of Our Business, results in a sharing of market risk between us and our employees. Approximately 35 of our ENI cost structure is variable, representing variable compensation and Acadian key employee distributions. These variable expenses generally are linked in a formulaic manner to the profitability of the business after covering operating expenses, which include base compensation and benefits, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization. In modeling the impact of market risk, we assume that these operating expenses remain unchanged, but the resulting impact on profit driven by increases or decreases in revenue will change variable compensation and Affiliate key employee distributions in line with their formulaic calculations. Any change in pre-tax profit is tax-affected to calculate profit after tax. 
 The value of our assets under management was 120.3 billion as of September 30, 2024. A 10 increase or decrease in the value of our assets under management, if proportionally distributed over all of our investment strategies, asset classes and client relationships, would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our gross management fee revenues of approximately 46 million based on our current weighted average fee rate of approximately 38 basis points. Approximately 20 billion, or 16 , of our AUM, are in accounts subject to performance fees. Of these assets, the majority are in accounts for which performance fees are calculated based on investment return that differs from the relative benchmark returns. Assuming the market change does not impact our relative performance, a 10 increase or decrease in AUM would have a 5 million impact to our gross performance fees based on our trailing twelve-month performance fees of 53 million as of September 30, 2024. The combined impact on our management fees and performance fees would have a direct impact on our earnings and result in an annual change of approximately 20 million in our post-tax economic net income, given our current cost structure and operating model. 
 Equity market risk, interest rate risk, and foreign currency risk are the market risks that could have the greatest impact on our management fees, performance fees and our business profitability. Impacts on our management and performance fees can be calculated based on the percentage of AUM constituting equity investments or foreign currency denominated investments, respectively, multiplied by the relevant weighted average management fee and performance fee attributable to that asset class. 
 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 Our equity markets-based AUM includes U.S. equities (including small cap through large cap securities and substantially value or blended investment styles) and global/non-U.S. equities (including global, non-U.S. and emerging markets securities). A 10 increase or decrease in equity markets would cause our 120 billion of equity assets under management to increase or decrease by 12 billion, resulting in a change in annualized management fee revenue of 46 million and an annual change in post-tax economic net income of approximately 18 million, given our current cost structure, operating model, and weighted average fee rate of 38 basis points at the mix of strategies as of September 30, 2024. Approximately 19 billion, or 16 , of our equity markets-based AUM are in accounts subject to performance fees. Of these assets, the majority are in accounts for which performance fees are calculated based on investment return in excess of the relative benchmark returns. Assuming the market change does not impact our relative performance, a 10 change in equity markets would have an approximate incremental 1 million impact from performance fees on our post-tax economic net income, given our current cost structure and operating model. 
 Foreign currency AUM includes equity and alternative assets denominated in foreign currencies. A 10 increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar would cause our 94 billion of foreign currency denominated AUM to increase or decrease by 9 billion, resulting in a change in annualized management fee revenue of 39 million and an annual change in post-tax economic net income of 15 million, based on weighted average fees earned on our foreign currency denominated AUM of 41 basis points at the mix of strategies as of September 30, 2024. Approximately 14 billion, or 15 , of our foreign currency denominated AUM are in accounts subject to performance fees. Of these assets, the majority are in accounts for which performance fees are calculated based on investment return that differs from the relative benchmark returns. Assuming the market change does not impact our relative performance, a 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have an approximate incremental 1 million impact from performance fees on our post-tax economic net income, given our current cost structure and operating model. 
 While the analysis above assumes that market changes occur in a uniform manner across the relevant portfolio, because of our declining fee rates for larger relationships and differences in our fee rates across asset classes, a change in the composition of our assets under management, in particular an increase in the proportion of our total assets under management attributable to strategies, clients or relationships with lower effective fee rates, could have a material negative impact on our overall weighted average fee rate. 
 As is customary in the asset management industry, clients invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to certain asset classes, which exposes their investment to the benefits and risks of such asset classes. We have not adopted a corporate-level risk management policy regarding client assets, nor have we attempted to hedge at the corporate level or within individual strategies the market risks that would affect the value of our overall assets under management and related revenues. Any reduction in the value of our assets under management would result in a reduction in our revenues. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowings under Acadian s revolving credit facility. Interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based upon variable interest rates. There were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. We currently do not hedge against interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would have resulted in an immaterial change to our interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
