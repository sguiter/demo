EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 of Kilroy Realty Corporation and Kilroy Realty, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to Kilroy Realty Corporation or the Company, we, our, and us mean Kilroy Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation, and its controlled and consolidated subsidiaries, and references to Kilroy Realty, L.P. or the Operating Partnership mean Kilroy Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and its controlled and consolidated subsidiaries. 
 The Company is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and the general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned an approximate 99.0 common general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining approximate 1.0 common limited partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated investors and a former executive officer and director. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company exercises exclusive and complete discretion over the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and control and can cause it to enter into certain major transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, and refinancings and cause changes in its line of business, capital structure, and distribution policies. 
 There are a few differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership that are reflected in the disclosures in this Form 10-Q. We believe it is important to understand the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how the Company and the Operating Partnership operate as an interrelated, consolidated company. The Company is a REIT, the only material asset of which is the partnership interests it holds in the Operating Partnership. As a result, the Company generally does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership. The Company itself is not directly obligated under any indebtedness, but generally guarantees all of the debt of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership owns substantially all of the assets of the Company either directly or through its subsidiaries, conducts the operations of the Company s business, and is structured as a limited partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by the Company, which the Company generally contributes to the Operating Partnership in exchange for units of partnership interest, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company s business through the Operating Partnership s operations, by the Operating Partnership s incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of units of partnership interest. 
 Noncontrolling interests, stockholders equity, and partners capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Company and those of the Operating Partnership. The common limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and, to the extent not held by the Company, as noncontrolling interests in the Company s financial statements. The differences between stockholders equity, partners capital, and noncontrolling interests result from the differences in the equity issued by the Company and the Operating Partnership. 
 We believe combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Company and the Operating Partnership into this single report results in the following benefits: 
 Combined reports better reflect how management and the analyst community view the business as a single operating unit; 
 Combined reports enhance investors understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole and in the same manner as management; 
 Combined reports are more efficient for the Company and the Operating Partnership and result in savings in time, effort and expense; and 
 Combined reports are more efficient for investors by reducing duplicative disclosure and providing a single document for their review. 
 To help investors understand the significant differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following separate sections for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership: 
 consolidated financial statements; 
 the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: 
 Note 12, Net Income Available to Common Stockholders Per Share of the Company; 
 Note 13, Net Income Available to Common Unitholders Per Unit of the Operating Partnership; 
 Note 14, Supplemental Cash Flows Information of the Company; and 
 Note 15, Supplemental Cash Flows Information of the Operating Partnership;

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company; and 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership. 
 This report also includes separate sections under Part I Financial Information, Item 4. Controls and Procedures and separate Exhibit 31 and Exhibit 32 certifications for the Company and the Operating Partnership to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of each entity have made the requisite certifications and that the Company and Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and 18 U.S.C. 1350.

 Our stabilized portfolio includes all of our properties with the exception of development properties currently committed for construction, under construction, in the tenant improvement phase, redevelopment properties under construction or in the tenant improvement phase, undeveloped land, and real estate assets held for sale. We define redevelopment properties as those properties for which we expect to spend significant development and construction costs pursuant to a formal plan to change its use, the intended result of which is a higher economic return on the property. We define properties in the tenant improvement phase as development or redevelopment properties where the project has reached cold shell condition and is ready for tenant improvements, which may require additional major base building construction before being placed in service. Projects in the tenant improvement phase are moved into our stabilized portfolio once the project reaches the earlier of occupancy or from the date of the cessation of major base building construction activities. Costs capitalized to construction in progress for development and redevelopment properties are transferred to land and improvements, buildings and improvements, and deferred leasing costs on our consolidated balance sheets as the projects or phases of projects are placed in service.

 Ownership and Basis of Presentation 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned an approximate common general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining approximate common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of September 30, 2024 was owned by non-affiliated investors and a former executive officer and director.

Generally, the number of common units held by the Company is equivalent to the number of outstanding shares of the Company s common stock, and the rights of all the common units to quarterly distributions and payments in liquidation mirror those of the Company s common stockholders. The common limited partners have certain redemption rights as provided in the Operating Partnership s Seventh Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (the Partnership Agreement ). With the exception of the Operating Partnership and our consolidated property partnerships, all of our subsidiaries are wholly-owned. 

At September 30, 2024, the consolidated financial statements of the Company included VIEs in addition to the Operating Partnership: 100 First LLC, 303 Second LLC, and one entity established during the third quarter of 2024 to facilitate a potential future Section 1031 Exchange. At September 30, 2024, the Company and the Operating Partnership were determined to be the primary beneficiaries of these VIEs since we had the ability to control the activities that most significantly impacted each of the VIEs economic performance. As of September 30, 2024, the VIEs total assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests included on our consolidated balance sheet were approximately million (of which million related to real estate held for investment), approximately million, and approximately

The use of forward equity sale agreements allows the Company to lock in a share price on the sale of shares of our common stock at the time an agreement is executed, but defer settling the forward equity sale agreements and receiving the proceeds from the sale of shares until a later date. The Company did not complete any sales of common stock under either program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 In February 2024, the Company s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program that authorizes the repurchase of shares of the Company s common stock having an aggregate gross purchase price of up to million. The Share Repurchase Program supersedes and replaces the Company s previous share repurchase program. Under the Share Repurchase Program, repurchases may be made from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions. The specific timing, price, and size of purchases will depend on prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions, and other considerations.

The remaining approximate common limited partnership interest as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was owned by non-affiliated investors and a former executive officer and director in the form of noncontrolling common units. There were common units outstanding held by these investors and a former executive officer and director as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The noncontrolling common units may be redeemed by unitholders for cash. Except under certain circumstances, we, at our option, may satisfy the cash redemption obligation with shares of the Company s common stock on a -for-one basis. If satisfied in cash, the value for each noncontrolling common unit upon redemption is the amount equal to the average of the closing quoted price per share of the Company s common stock, par value per share, as reported on the NYSE for the trading days immediately preceding the applicable redemption date. The aggregate value upon redemption of the then-outstanding noncontrolling common units was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This redemption value does not necessarily represent the amount that would be distributed with respect to each noncontrolling common unit in the event of our termination or liquidation. In the event of our termination or liquidation, it is generally expected that each common unit would be entitled to a liquidating distribution equal to the liquidating distribution payable in respect of each share of the Company s common stock.

 share-based incentive compensation plan, the Kilroy Realty 2006 Incentive Award Plan, as amended (the 2006 Plan ). The Company has a currently effective registration statement registering million shares of our common stock for possible issuance under our 2006 Plan. As of September 30, 2024, approximately million shares were available for grant under the 2006 Plan. The calculation of shares available for grant is presented after taking into account a reserve for a sufficient number of shares to cover the vesting and payment of 2006 Plan awards that were outstanding on that date, including performance-based vesting awards at (i) levels actually achieved for the performance conditions (as defined below) for which the performance period has been completed and (ii) at maximum levels for the other performance and market conditions (as defined below) for awards still in a performance period. 
 
 Executive Transitions 
 
 On January 21, 2024, John Kilroy retired as the Company's Chief Executive Officer CEO while remaining Chair and a member of the Board of Directors through May 22, 2024. On January 22, 2024, Angela Aman joined the Company as CEO and a member of the Board of Directors and was granted Time-Based Restricted Stock Units RSUs with a vesting period. 
 
 On July 30, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors appointed Jeffrey Kuehling to serve as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer CFO ), effective August 19, 2024, and he was granted Time-Based RSUs with a -year vesting period. In connection with Mr. Kuehling s appointment as CFO, Eliott Trencher no longer serves as the Company s CFO. Mr. Trencher will continue to serve as the Company s Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer. 
 
 2024 Share-Based Compensation Grants 
 
 In February 2024, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors awarded restricted stock units to certain officers of the Company under the 2006 Plan, which included RSUs (at the target level of performance) that are subject to time, market, and/or performance-based vesting requirements (the 2024 Performance-Based RSUs and RSUs that are subject to time-based vesting requirements (the 2024 Time-Based RSUs ). Each RSU granted is entitled to earn dividend equivalents in the form of RSUs that vest upon vesting of the underlying RSU award. 
 
 2024 Performance-Based RSU Grant 
 
 The 2024 Performance-Based RSUs are scheduled to vest at the end of a period (consisting of calendar years 2024-2026). A target number of 2024 Performance-Based RSUs were awarded, and the final number of 2024 Performance-Based RSUs that vest (which may be more or less than the target number) will be based upon (1) during the first calendar year of the performance measurement period, the achievement of pre-set FFO per share goals that applies to of the Performance-Based RSUs awarded (the FFO Performance Condition and (2) a performance measure that applies to of the award based upon a measure of the Company s average net debt to EBITDA ratio for the performance period (the Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio Performance Condition and a market measure that applies to the other of the award based upon the relative ranking of the Company s total stockholder return for the performance period compared to the total stockholder returns of an established comparison group of companies over the same period (the Market Condition ). The 2024 Performance-Based RSUs are also subject to a service vesting provision (the service vesting condition and are scheduled to cliff vest on the date the final vesting percentage is determined following the end of the performance period under the awards. The number of 2024 Performance-Based RSUs ultimately earned could fluctuate from the target number of 2024 Performance-Based RSUs granted based upon the levels of achievement for the FFO Performance Condition, the Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio Performance Condition, the Market Condition, and the extent to which the service vesting condition is satisfied. The estimate of the number of 2024 Performance-Based RSUs earned is evaluated quarterly during the performance period based on our estimate for each of the performance conditions measured against the applicable goals. 
 
 Compensation expense for the 2024 Performance-Based RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each participant, which is generally the service period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized million of compensation expense for the 2024 Performance-Based RSUs assuming the 2024 FFO Performance Condition is met at of target level of achievement for our CEO) and the 2024 Net Debt to EBITDA

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

of the target level of achievement. In the event we achieve a lower level of performance or fail to meet the FFO Performance Condition, we would reverse a portion or all of the million of compensation expense. 
 
 Each 2024 Performance-Based RSU represents the right to receive share of our common stock in the future subject to, and as modified by, the Company s level of achievement of the applicable performance and market conditions. The fair value of the portion of the award subject to the Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio Performance Condition was calculated using the closing price of the Company s common stock on the valuation date noted below. 
 
 Expected share price volatility Risk-free interest rate 
 ________________________ 
 (1) For one participant, the fair value per share on the valuation date for their 2024 Performance-Based RSUs is . 
 
 The computation of expected volatility was based on a blend of the historical volatility of our shares of common stock over a period of twice the remaining performance period as of the grant date and implied volatility data based on the observed pricing of publicly-traded options on shares of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate was based on the yield curve on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury STRIP securities in effect at February 1, 2024. 
 
 The fair value of the 2024 Performance-Based RSU grant as of the valuation date noted above, based on a target level of achievement, was million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value per share for each component multiplied by the estimated number of RSUs to be earned. 
 
 2024 Time-Based RSU Grants 
 
 The 2024 Time-Based RSUs are scheduled to vest in equal annual installments beginning on January 5, 2025 through January 5, 2027. Compensation expense for the 2024 Time-Based RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the explicit service period. Each 2024 Time-Based RSU represents the right to receive share of our common stock in the future, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date, unless accelerated upon separation of employment, provided certain conditions are met. The total grant date fair value of the 2024 Time-Based RSU awards was million, which was based on the closing share price of the Company s common stock on the NYSE on the February 1, 2024 grant date. 
 
 2023 and 2022 Performance-Based RSUs 
 
 Consistent with the 2024 Performance-Based RSU grant discussed above, the final number of 2023 and 2022 Performance-Based RSUs that vest will be based upon (1) the FFO Performance Condition that applies to of the Performance-Based RSUs awarded as determined at the end of the first calendar year of the performance measurement period and (2) the Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio Performance Condition that applies to of the award and the Market Condition that applies to the other of the award, both of which are based on the full performance measurement period. The 2023 FFO Performance Condition was achieved at of the target level of achievement. The 2022 FFO Performance Condition was achieved at of the target level of achievement. 
 
 Compensation cost for the 2023 Performance-Based RSUs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 assumes the 2023 Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio Performance Condition is met at of the target level of achievement. Compensation cost for the 2022 performance-based RSUs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 assumes the 2022 Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio Performance Condition is met at of the target level of achievement.

million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Share-based compensation costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 include million and million, respectively, of accelerated share-based compensation costs for our former CEO and former President. Of the total share-based compensation costs, million and million were capitalized as part of real estate assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million were capitalized as part of real estate assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs granted under share-based compensation arrangements. Such amount is based in part upon the estimated future outcome of the performance metrics as of September 30, 2024, and the actual compensation cost ultimately recognized could increase or decrease from this estimate based upon actual performance results. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. The remaining compensation cost related to these nonvested RSU awards had been recognized in periods prior to September 30, 2024.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Statements contained in this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements or information concerning our plans, objectives, capital resources, portfolio performance, results of operations, projected future occupancy and rental rates, lease expirations, debt maturities, potential investments, strategies such as capital recycling, development and redevelopment activity, projected construction costs, projected construction commencement and completion dates, projected square footage of space that could be constructed on undeveloped land that we own, projected rentable square footage of or number of units in properties under construction or in the development pipeline, anticipated proceeds from capital recycling activity or other dispositions and anticipated dates of those activities or dispositions, projected increases in the value of properties, dispositions, future executive incentive compensation, pending, potential or proposed acquisitions, plans to grow our Net Operating Income and FFO, our ability to re-lease properties at or above current market rates, anticipated market conditions and demographics and other forward-looking financial data, as well as the discussion in Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resource of the Company, and Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believes, expects, projects, may, will, should, seeks, approximately, intends, plans, pro forma, estimates , or anticipates and the negative of these words and phrases and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, beliefs, and assumptions, and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks, changes in circumstances, trends, and factors that are difficult to predict, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, actual performance, results, and events may vary materially from those indicated or implied in the forward-looking statements, and you should not rely on the forward-looking statements as predictions of future performance, results, or events. Numerous factors could cause actual future performance, results, and events to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including, among others: global market and general economic conditions, including periods of heightened inflation, and their effect on our liquidity and financial conditions and those of our tenants; adverse economic or real estate conditions generally, and specifically, in the States of California, Texas, and Washington; risks associated with our investment in real estate assets, which are illiquid, and with trends in the real estate industry; defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants; any significant downturn in tenants businesses, including bankruptcy, lack of liquidity or lack of funding, and the impact labor disruptions or strikes, such as episodic strikes in the entertainment industry, may have on our tenants businesses; our ability to re-lease property at or above current market rates; reduced demand for office space, including as a result of remote working and flexible working arrangements that allow work from remote locations other than an employer s office premises; costs to comply with government regulations, including environmental remediation; the availability of cash for distribution and debt service, and exposure to risk of default under debt obligations; increases in interest rates and our ability to manage interest rate exposure; changes in interest rates and the availability of financing on attractive terms or at all, which may adversely impact our future interest expense and our ability to pursue development, redevelopment, and acquisition opportunities and refinance existing debt; a decline in real estate asset valuations, which may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices, or obtain or maintain debt financing, and which may result in write-offs or impairment charges; significant competition, which may decrease the occupancy and rental rates of properties; potential losses that may not be covered by insurance; the ability to successfully complete acquisitions and dispositions on announced terms; the ability to successfully operate acquired, developed, and redeveloped properties; the ability to successfully complete development and redevelopment projects on schedule and within budgeted amounts; delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, and other required entitlements, governmental permits and authorizations for our development and redevelopment properties; increases in anticipated capital expenditures, tenant improvement, and/or leasing costs; defaults on leases for land on which some of our properties are located; adverse changes to, or enactment or implementations of, tax laws or other applicable laws, regulations, or legislation, as well as business and consumer reactions to such changes; risks associated with joint venture investments, including our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on co-venturers financial condition, and disputes between us and our co-venturers; environmental uncertainties and risks related to natural disasters; risks associated with climate change and our sustainability strategies, and our ability to achieve our sustainability goals; and our ability to maintain our status as a REIT. The factors included in this report are not exhaustive and additional factors could adversely affect our business and financial performance. For a discussion of additional factors that could materially adversely affect the 
 28 

Company s and the Operating Partnership s business and financial performance, see the discussion below, as well as in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s and the Operating Partnership s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and their respective other filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and speak only as of the dates on which they are made. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement that becomes untrue because of subsequent events, new information, or otherwise, except to the extent we are required to do so in connection with our ongoing requirements under federal securities laws. 

Overview and Background 
 
 We are a self-administered REIT active in premier office, life science, and mixed-use property types in the United States. We own, develop, acquire, and manage real estate assets, consisting primarily of premier properties in Los Angeles, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and Austin, which are markets that we believe have strategic advantages and strong barriers to entry. We own our interests in all of our real estate assets through the Operating Partnership and conduct substantially all of our operations through the Operating Partnership. We owned an approximate 99.0 general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, all of our properties are held in fee except for the fourteen office buildings that are held subject to long-term ground leases. 

Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations 
 
 Development and Redevelopment Programs 
 
 We believe that a portion of our long-term future growth will continue to come from the completion of our in-process development and redevelopment projects and, subject to market conditions, from identifying new redevelopment opportunities and executing on our future development pipeline. Our future development pipeline may also expand in the future through targeted acquisitions of development opportunities on the West Coast and in Austin, Texas, subject to market conditions. 
 
 We have a proactive planning process by which we continually evaluate the size, timing, costs, and scope of our development and redevelopment programs and, as necessary, scale activity to reflect the economic conditions and the real estate fundamentals that exist in our submarkets. We expect to execute on our development and redevelopment programs with prudence and will be pursuing opportunities with attractive economic returns in strategic locations with proximity to public transportation or transportation access, retail amenities, and in markets with strong fundamentals and visible demand. We generally plan to develop projects in phases, as appropriate, and we favor starting projects with significant pre-leasing activity. 
 
 In-Process Redevelopment - Tenant Improvement 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had two redevelopment projects in the tenant improvement phase: 
 
 4690 Executive Drive, University Towne Center, San Diego, California. In March 2022, we began the phased redevelopment of this property and completed base building components and moved the building to the tenant improvement phase during the third quarter of 2024. This project is comprised of approximately 52,000 square feet of life science space with a total estimated investment of 25.0 million, inclusive of the depreciated basis of the building. 
 
 4400 Bohannon Drive, Menlo Park, California. In December 2022, we began the redevelopment of this property in the Other Peninsula submarket and completed base building components and moved the building to the tenant improvement phase during the third quarter of 2024. This project is comprised of approximately 48,000 square feet of life science space with a total estimated investment of 55.0 million, inclusive of the depreciated basis of the building. 
 
 In-Process Development - Under Construction 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had one development project under construction: 
 
 Kilroy Oyster Point (Phase 2), South San Francisco, California. In June 2021, we commenced construction on Phase 2 of this 39-acre life science campus situated on the waterfront in South San Francisco. The second phase encompasses approximately 875,000 square feet of office and life science space across three buildings with a total estimated investment of 1.0 billion. 
 
 29 

Future Development Pipeline 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our future development pipeline included eight future projects located in Los Angeles, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and Austin with an aggregate cost basis of approximately 1.4 billion, at which we believe we could develop more than 6.0 million rentable square feet, subject to market conditions and the entitlement of these projects. 
 
 The following table sets forth information about our future development pipeline:

 ________________________ 
 (1) Represents developable office/life science square feet and/or residential units. The developable square feet and scope of projects could change materially from estimated data provided due to one or more of the following: significant changes in the economy, market conditions, tenant requirements and demands, construction costs, new supply, regulatory and entitlement processes, or project design. 
 (2) Represents cash paid and costs incurred, including accrued liabilities in accordance with GAAP, as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Fluctuations in our development activities could cause fluctuations in the average development asset balances qualifying for interest and other carrying cost and internal cost capitalization in future periods. A slowdown in development activities could result in fewer projects qualifying for interest capitalization under GAAP, resulting in higher interest expense. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we capitalized interest on in-process development and redevelopment projects and future development pipeline projects with an average aggregate cost basis of approximately 1.9 billion as it was determined these projects qualified for interest and other carrying cost capitalization under GAAP. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we capitalized 20.8 million and 61.1 million, respectively, of interest to our qualifying development and redevelopment projects. In addition, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we capitalized 3.4 million and 9.3 million, respectively, of internal costs to our qualifying development and redevelopment projects and 2.1 million and 6.7 million, respectively, of internal costs to our qualifying capital improvement projects in the stabilized portfolio. 
 
 Capital Recycling Program . We continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of non-core properties in our portfolio or the formation of strategic ventures with the intent of using the proceeds generated to acquire new operating and development properties, to finance development and redevelopment expenditures, to repay long-term debt, and for other general corporate purposes. As part of this strategy, we often attempt to enter into transactions intended to qualify as like-kind exchanges pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code Section 1031 Exchanges and other tax deferred transaction structures, when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales, if any, for federal and state income tax purposes. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership Liquidity Sources section for further discussion of our capital recycling activities. 
 
 The timing of any potential future disposition or strategic venture transactions will depend on market conditions and other factors, including but not limited to, our capital needs, the availability of financing for potential buyers (which has been and may continue to be constrained due to current economic and market conditions) and our ability to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales. We cannot assure that we will dispose of any additional properties, enter into any additional strategic ventures, or that we will be able to identify and complete acquisitions of suitable replacement properties to effect a 
 30 

Section 1031 Exchange or be able to use other tax deferred structures in connection with our strategy. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership Liquidity Sources section for further information. 
 
 Acquisitions . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired one operating property, comprised of two buildings, in one transaction for a cash purchase price of 35.0 million. As part of our growth strategy, which is highly dependent on market conditions and business cycles, among other factors, we continue to evaluate strategic opportunities and remain a disciplined buyer of core, value-add and strategic operating properties, and land. We focus on growth opportunities primarily in markets populated by knowledge and creative-based tenants in a variety of industries, including technology, media, healthcare, life sciences, entertainment, and professional services. Against the backdrop of market volatility, we expect to manage a strong balance sheet and selectively evaluate opportunities that we believe have the potential to either add immediate Net Operating Income to our portfolio or play a strategic role in our future growth. We generally finance our acquisitions through proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, proceeds from our capital recycling program, the assumption of existing debt, and cash flows from operations. 
 
 In connection with our growth strategy, we may have one or more potential acquisitions of properties and/or undeveloped land under consideration that are in varying stages of negotiation and due diligence review, or under contract, at any point in time. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will enter into any agreements to acquire properties or undeveloped land, or that the potential acquisitions contemplated by any agreements we may enter into in the future will be completed. In addition, acquisitions are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and we may be unable to complete an acquisition after making a nonrefundable deposit or incurring acquisition-related costs. 
 
 Incentive Compensation . Our Executive Compensation Committee determines compensation, including cash bonuses and equity incentives, for our executive officers, as defined in Rule 16 under the Exchange Act. For 2024, the annual cash bonus program was structured to allow the Executive Compensation Committee to evaluate the Company s performance against pre-established goals under a variety of key quantitative and qualitative metrics at the end of the year and make a determination based on the Company s and management s overall performance. Our Executive Compensation Committee also grants equity incentive awards from time to time that include performance-based and/or market-measure based vesting requirements and time-based vesting requirements. As a result, accrued incentive compensation and compensation expense for future awards may be affected by our operating and development performance, financial results, stock price, market conditions, liquidity measures, and other factors. Consequently, we cannot predict the amounts that will be recorded in future periods related to such incentive compensation. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately 30.3 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to outstanding nonvested RSUs granted under share-based compensation arrangements. Such amount is based in part upon the estimated future outcome of the performance metrics as of September 30, 2024, and the actual compensation cost ultimately recognized could increase or decrease from this estimate based upon actual performance results. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. The 30.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost does not reflect the future compensation costs for any share-based awards that may be granted subsequent to September 30, 2024. Share-based compensation expense for potential future awards could be affected by our operating and development performance, financial results, stock price, market conditions, and other factors. For additional information regarding our equity incentive awards, see Note 8 Share-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Information on Leases Commenced and Executed 
 
 Leasing Activity and Changes in Rental Rates . The amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space, newly developed or redeveloped properties, newly acquired properties with vacant space, and space available from unscheduled lease terminations. The amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods. The following tables set forth certain information regarding leasing activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

(4) Represents leases commenced or executed at properties in the stabilized portfolio during the period, excluding leases with a lease term of less than one year. Excludes leases commenced at space not previously leased at recently completed development projects that have been added to the stabilized portfolio and at space in the stabilized portfolio for which we are incurring significant non-recurring capital expenditures to reposition and is expected to result in additional revenue generated when re-leased. 
 (5) Represents leases commenced or executed at space not previously leased, recently completed development projects that have been added to the stabilized portfolio, at space in the stabilized portfolio for which we are incurring significant non-recurring capital expenditures to reposition and is expected to result in additional revenue generated when re-leased, and at projects in our development and redevelopment portfolios. 
 (6) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, 12 new leases totaling 73,646 rentable square feet were signed but not commenced. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 28 new leases totaling 242,983 rentable square feet were signed but not commenced. 
 (7) Calculated as the percentage of space either renewed by existing tenants at lease expiration or termination. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to see modest additional increases in physical occupancy and increased tour activity at our properties. However, we believe that economic uncertainty and hybrid/remote working arrangements have impacted the timing and volume of leasing and will likely continue to do so in the near future and possibly longer-term. Additionally, decreased demand (including as a result of remote work), increased competition (including sublease space available in the market), and other negative trends or unforeseeable events that impair our ability to timely renew or re-lease space could have negative effects on our future financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Scheduled Lease Expirations . The following tables set forth certain information regarding our lease expirations for our stabilized portfolio, excluding our residential properties, for the remainder of 2024 and the next five years and by region for the remainder of 2024 and in 2025.

 (1) For leases that have been renewed early with existing tenants, the expiration date and annualized base rent information presented takes into consideration the renewed lease terms. Excludes leases not commenced as of September 30, 2024, space leased under month-to-month leases, storage leases, vacant space, and future lease renewal options not executed as of September 30, 2024. 
 (2) Includes 100 of annualized base rent of consolidated property partnerships. 
 (3) Annualized base rent includes the impact of straight-lining rent escalations and the amortization of free rent periods and excludes the impact of the following: amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded tenant improvements, amortization of above/below market rents, amortization for lease incentives due under existing leases, and expense reimbursement revenue. Additionally, the underlying leases contain various expense structures, including full service gross, modified gross, and triple net. Percentages represent percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual base rental revenue. For additional information on tenant improvement and leasing commission costs incurred by the Company for the current reporting period, please see further discussion under the caption Information on Leases Commenced and Executed. 
 (4) Adjusting for leasing transactions executed as of September 30, 2024 but not yet commenced, the 2024, 2025, and 2026 expirations would be reduced by 7,623, 64,142, and 156,785 square feet, respectively. 
 
 33 

In addition to the 2.7 million rentable square feet, or 15.7 , of currently available space in our stabilized portfolio, leases representing approximately 7.4 of the occupied square footage of our stabilized portfolio are scheduled to expire during the remainder of 2024 and in 2025. The leases scheduled to expire during the remainder of 2024 and in 2025 represent approximately 1.0 million rentable square feet, or 6.3 of our total annualized base rental revenue. Adjusting for leases executed as of September 30, 2024 but not yet commenced, the remaining 2024, 2025, and 2026 expirations would be 276,387, 688,190, and 1,738,273 square feet, respectively. 
 
 Our rental rates and occupancy are impacted by general economic conditions, including the pace of regional economic growth and access to capital. Therefore, we cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be re-leased at rental rates equal to or above the current market rates. 
 Sublease Space . Of our occupied space as of September 30, 2024, approximately 1.8 million rentable square feet, or 10.6 of the square footage in our stabilized portfolio, was available for sublease, primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area. Of the 10.6 of available sublease space in our stabilized portfolio as of September 30, 2024, approximately 8.7 was vacant space, and the remaining 1.9 was occupied by subtenants. Of the approximately 1.8 million rentable square feet available for sublease as of September 30, 2024, approximately 76,031 rentable square feet representing one lease is scheduled to expire in 2024 and approximately 100,795 rentable square feet representing two leases are scheduled to expire in 2025. 
 34 

Stabilized Portfolio Information 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our stabilized portfolio was comprised of 123 office, life science, and mixed-use properties encompassing an aggregate of approximately 17.1 million rentable square feet and 1,001 residential units. Our stabilized portfolio includes all of our properties with the exception of development properties currently committed for construction, under construction, and in the tenant improvement phase, redevelopment projects under construction, undeveloped land, and real estate assets held for sale. We define redevelopment properties as those properties for which we expect to spend significant development and construction costs pursuant to a formal plan to change its use, the intended result of which is a higher economic return on the property. We define properties in the tenant improvement phase as development or redevelopment properties where the project has reached cold shell condition and is ready for tenant improvements, which may require additional major base building construction before being placed in service. Projects in the tenant improvement phase are moved into our stabilized portfolio once the project reaches the earlier of 95 occupancy or one year from the date of the cessation of major base building construction activities. Costs capitalized to construction in progress for development and redevelopment properties are transferred to land and improvements, buildings and improvements, and deferred leasing costs on our consolidated balance sheets as the projects or phases of projects are placed in service. 
 
 We did not have any properties held for sale at September 30, 2024. Our stabilized portfolio also excludes our future development pipeline, which as of September 30, 2024 was comprised of eight potential development sites, representing approximately 64 gross acres of undeveloped land, on which we believe we have the potential to develop more than 6.0 million rentable square feet, depending upon economic conditions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the following properties were excluded from our stabilized portfolio:

Results of Operations 
 
 Net Operating Income 
 
 Management internally evaluates the operating performance and financial results of our stabilized portfolio based on Net Operating Income. We define Net Operating Income as consolidated operating revenues (rental income and other property income) less consolidated operating expenses (property expenses, real estate taxes and ground leases). 
 
 Net Operating Income is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because we believe it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of our properties excluding corporate and financing-related costs and non-cash depreciation and amortization. Net Operating Income is an unlevered operating performance metric of our properties and allows for a useful comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. This measure thereby provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from net income. In addition, Net Operating Income is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful starting point for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. Other real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating Net Operating Income, and accordingly, our presentation of Net Operating Income may not be comparable to other real estate companies. Because of the exclusion of the items shown in the reconciliation below, Net Operating Income should only be used as a supplemental measure of our financial performance and not as an alternative to GAAP income from operations or net income. 
 
 Management further evaluates Net Operating Income by evaluating the performance from the following property groups: 
 
 Same Store Properties includes the consolidated results of all of the office properties that were owned and included in our stabilized portfolio for two comparable reporting periods, i.e., owned and included in our stabilized portfolio as of January 1, 2023 and still owned and included in the stabilized portfolio as of September 30, 2024, including our three residential properties in Hollywood and Del Mar, California; 
 
 Development Properties includes the results generated by certain of our in-process development and redevelopment projects, expenses for certain of our future development projects, and the results generated by the following stabilized development properties: 
 
 One office building that was added to the stabilized portfolio in the third quarter of 2023; and 
 One office building that was added to the stabilized portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2023; 
 
 Acquisition Properties includes the results, from the date of acquisition through the periods presented, for the one property acquired in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 The following table sets forth certain information regarding the property groups within our stabilized office portfolio as of September 30, 2024: 
 Group # of Buildings Rentable Square Feet Same Store Properties 119 16,207,143 Stabilized Development and Redevelopment Properties (1)

 Net Operating Income increased 3.3 million, or 1.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily resulting from: 
 
 An increase in Net Operating Income of 2.7 million, or 1.5 , attributable to the Same Store Properties, which was driven by the following activity: 
 
 An increase in total operating revenues of 5.3 million, or 1.9 , primarily due to: 
 
 4.6 million net increase in non-recurring revenue items primarily related to bankruptcy and tenant restoration income of 4.9 million in 2024 and higher revenue from certain tenants on cash basis of revenue recognition of 0.9 million in 2024, partially offset by tenant restoration income 1.2 million in 2023; and 
 
 3.4 million increase due to higher recoverable operating expenses of 2.9 million in 2024, of which 1.3 million is attributable to an approximately 455,000 square foot building in the San Francisco Bay area that was previously tenant-managed becoming landlord-managed, and an increase of 0.5 million in parking income in 2024; partially offset by 
 
 2.7 million decrease in operating revenues from net lease expirations; and 
 
 A net increase in property and related expenses of 2.6 million, or 3.0 , primarily due to utilities, security expenses, contract services, and repairs and maintenance of 3.8 million due to cost increases, which includes 1.2 million related to the aforementioned building that was previously tenant-managed becoming landlord-managed, partially offset by 1.2 million of property tax refunds; and 
 
 An increase in Net Operating Income of 0.5 million, or 7.1 , attributable to the Development Properties. 
 
 Other Expenses and Income 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 6.7 million, or 27.0 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation expense. 
 
 Leasing Costs 
 
 Leasing costs increased 0.5 million, or 27.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in leasing overhead during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 6.7 million, or 7.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the following: 
 
 An increase of 4.4 million attributable to the Same Store Properties primarily due to an early lease termination in the third quarter of 2024; and 
 
 An increase of 2.3 million attributable to the Development Properties. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 The following table sets forth our gross interest expense, including debt discounts and deferred financing cost amortization and capitalized interest, including capitalized debt discounts and deferred financing cost amortization, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Dollar Change Percentage

 Gross interest expense, before the effect of capitalized interest and deferred financing costs, increased 7.3 million, or 14.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in the average outstanding debt balance and an increase in the weighted average interest rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Capitalized interest and deferred financing costs increased 0.8 million, or 3.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the weighted average interest and loan fee amortization rate during the three months ended September 30, 2024. In the event of an extended cessation of development or redevelopment activities to get any of these projects ready for its intended use, such projects could potentially no longer qualify for capitalization of interest or other carrying costs, resulting in higher amounts being expensed. 
 
 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Property Partnerships 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated property partnerships decreased 0.7 million, or 12.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower rental income driven by a temporary decrease in occupancy during the third quarter of 2024 at one property held in a consolidated property partnership and a lease expiration payment received during the third quarter of 2023 at another property held in a consolidated property partnership. The amounts reported for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are comprised of the noncontrolling interest s share of net income for 100 First Street Member, LLC and 303 Second Street Member, LLC and the noncontrolling interest s share of net income for Redwood City Partners, LLC.

Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company 
 
 In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company section, the term the Company refers only to Kilroy Realty Corporation on an unconsolidated basis and excludes the Operating Partnership and all other subsidiaries. 
 
 The Company s business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership. Distributions from the Operating Partnership are the Company s primary source of capital. The Company believes the Operating Partnership s sources of working capital, specifically its cash flows from operations and borrowings available under its unsecured revolving credit facility and funds from its capital recycling program, including strategic ventures, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the Company and, in turn, for the Company to make its dividend payments to its common stockholders for the next twelve months. Cash flows from operating activities generated by the Operating Partnership for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were sufficient to cover the Company s payment of cash dividends to its stockholders. However, there can be no assurance that the Operating Partnership s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distributions to the Company. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership s ability to make distributions to the Company, which would in turn, adversely affect the Company s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders. 
 
 The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer and the Company and the Operating Partnership have an effective shelf registration statement that provides for the public offering and sale from time to time by the Company of its preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants, and guarantees of debt securities and by the Operating Partnership of its debt securities, in each case in unlimited amounts. The Company evaluates the capital markets on an ongoing basis for opportunities to raise capital, and, as circumstances warrant, the Company and the Operating Partnership may issue securities of all of these types in one or more offerings at any time and from time to time on an opportunistic basis, depending upon, among other things, market conditions, available pricing, and capital needs. When the Company receives proceeds from the sales of its preferred or common stock, it generally contributes the net proceeds from those sales to the Operating Partnership in exchange for corresponding preferred or common partnership units of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership may use these proceeds and proceeds from the sale of its debt securities to repay debt, including borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan facility, to develop new or redevelop existing properties, to make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties, or for general corporate purposes. 
 
 As the sole general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are substantially the same on their respective financial statements. The section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole. 
 
 Liquidity Highlights 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 625.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and 1.1 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. In January 2024, the Operating Partnership issued 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in a registered public offering at an interest rate of 6.250 . In March 2024, the Operating Partnership amended and restated the terms of its unsecured revolving credit facility to maintain the existing 1.1 billion borrowing capacity and extend the maturity date to July 31, 2028, repaid 200.0 million on its existing 520.0 million unsecured term loan facility (the 2022 Term Loan Facility ), and extended the maturity date on an aggregate principal amount of 200.0 million of the remaining 320.0 million by 12 months to October 3, 2025. In September 2024, the Operating Partnership repaid the 120.0 million outstanding on the 2022 Term Loan Facility. Our next debt maturity of 403.7 million occurs in December 2024. We believe that our available liquidity demonstrates a strong balance sheet and makes us well positioned to navigate any additional future uncertainties. In addition, the Company is a well-known seasoned issuer and has historically been able to raise capital on a timely basis in the public markets, as well as the private markets. Any future financings, however, will depend on market conditions for both capital raises and the investment of such proceeds, and there can be no assurances that we will successfully obtain such financings.

Distribution Requirements 
 
 The Company is required to distribute 90 of its taxable income (subject to certain adjustments and excluding net capital gains) on an annual basis to maintain qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and is required to pay income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent it distributes less than 100 of its taxable income (including capital gains). As a result of these distribution requirements, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent as other companies whose parent companies are not REITs. In addition, the Company may be required to use borrowings under the Operating Partnership s revolving credit facility, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain its REIT status. The Company may also need to raise capital to fund the Operating Partnership s working capital needs, as well as potential developments of new or existing properties or acquisitions. 
 
 The Company intends to continue to make, but has not committed to make, regular quarterly cash distributions to common stockholders, and through the Operating Partnership, to common unitholders from the Operating Partnership s cash flows from operating activities. All such distributions are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. As the Company intends to maintain distributions at a level sufficient to meet the REIT distribution requirements and minimize its obligation to pay income and excise taxes, it will continue to evaluate whether the current levels of distribution are appropriate to do so throughout 2024. In addition, in the event the Company completes additional dispositions in the future and is unable to successfully complete Section 1031 Exchanges to defer some or all of the taxable gains related to property dispositions (or in the event additional legislation is enacted that further modifies or repeals laws with respect to Section 1031 Exchanges), the Company may be required to distribute a special dividend to its common stockholders and common unitholders in order to minimize or eliminate income taxes on such gains. The Company considers market factors and its performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining its distribution levels. Amounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts and short-term interest-bearing securities, which is consistent with the Company s intention to maintain its qualification as a REIT. Such investments may include, for example, obligations of the Government National Mortgage Association, other governmental agency securities, certificates of deposit and interest-bearing bank deposits. 
 
 On September 16, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.54 per share of common stock. The regular quarterly cash dividend is payable to stockholders of record on September 30, 2024 and a corresponding cash distribution of 0.54 per Operating Partnership unit is payable to holders of the Operating Partnership s common limited partnership interests of record on September 30, 2024, including those owned by the Company. The total cash quarterly dividends and distributions paid on October 9, 2024 were 64.4 million. 
 
 Debt Covenants 
 
 The covenants contained within certain of our unsecured debt obligations generally prohibit the Company from paying dividends during an event of default in excess of an amount which results in distributions to us in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay dividends to our stockholders that we reasonably believe are necessary to (a) maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal and state income tax purposes and (b) avoid the payment of federal or state income or excise tax.

Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership 
 
 In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership section, the terms we, our, and us refer to the Operating Partnership or the Operating Partnership and the Company together, as the context requires. 
 
 General 
 
 Our primary liquidity sources and uses are as follows: 
 
 Liquidity Sources 
 
 Net cash flows from operations; 
 Borrowings under the Operating Partnership s unsecured revolving credit facility; 
 Proceeds from our capital recycling program, including the disposition of assets and the formation of strategic ventures; 
 Proceeds from additional secured or unsecured debt financings; and 
 Proceeds from public or private issuance of debt, equity or preferred equity securities. 
 
 Liquidity Uses 
 
 Property operating and corporate expenses; 
 Capital expenditures and tenant improvement and leasing costs; 
 Development and redevelopment costs; 
 Operating property or undeveloped land acquisitions; 
 Debt service and principal payments, including debt maturities; 
 Distributions to common security holders; 
 Repurchases and redemptions of outstanding common stock of the Company; and 
 Outstanding debt repurchases, redemptions and repayments. 
 
 General Strategy 
 
 Our general strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet with a strong credit profile and to maintain a capital structure that allows for financial flexibility and diversification of capital resources. We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our long-term capital requirements. We believe that our current projected liquidity requirements for the next twelve-month period, as set forth above under the caption Liquidity Uses, will be satisfied using a combination of the liquidity sources listed above, although there can be no assurance in this regard. We believe our conservative leverage and staggered debt maturities provide us with financial flexibility and enhance our ability to obtain additional sources of liquidity if necessary, and, therefore, we are well-positioned to refinance or repay maturing debt and to pursue our strategy of seeking attractive acquisition opportunities, which we may finance, as necessary, with future public and private issuances of debt and equity securities, although there can be no assurance in this regard.

Liquidity Sources 
 
 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities 
 
 In March 2024, the Operating Partnership amended and restated the terms of its unsecured revolving credit facility. The amendment and restatement maintained the 1.1 billion borrowing capacity and extended the maturity date of the unsecured revolving credit facility to July 31, 2028. 
 
 The following table summarizes the balance and terms of our unsecured revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in thousands) Outstanding borrowings Remaining borrowing capacity (1)

 ________________________ 
 (1) Remaining and total borrowing capacity are further reduced by the amount of our outstanding letters of credit which total approximately 5.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We may elect to borrow, subject to bank approval and obtaining commitments for any additional borrowing capacity, up to an additional 500.0 million under an accordion feature pursuant to the terms of the unsecured revolving credit facility. 
 (2) Our unsecured revolving credit facility interest rate was calculated using the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 Adjusted SOFR and a margin of 0.900 based on our credit rating as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We may be entitled to a temporary 0.01 reduction in the interest rate provided we meet certain sustainability goals with respect to the ongoing reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. 
 (3) Our facility fee is paid on a quarterly basis and is calculated based on the total borrowing capacity. In addition to the facility fee, we incurred debt origination and legal costs in connection with the amendment and restatement of the unsecured revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 13.6 million and 3.2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, respectively, which are included in prepaid expenses and other assets, net on our consolidated balance sheets, remained to be amortized through the maturity date of our unsecured revolving credit facility. 
 (4) The maturity date may be extended by two six-month periods, at the Operating Partnership s election. 
 
 The Operating Partnership intends to borrow under the unsecured revolving credit facility from time to time for general corporate purposes, including to finance development and redevelopment expenditures, to fund potential acquisitions, to repay long-term debt, and to supplement cash balances in response to market conditions. 
 
 In connection with amending and restating the unsecured revolving credit facility, the Operating Partnership repaid 200.0 million of its existing 520.0 million unsecured term loan facility (the 2022 Term Loan Facility and extended the maturity date on 200.0 million of the remaining 320.0 million principal balance by 12 months to October 3, 2025 (the 2024 Term Loan Facility ). The following table summarizes the balance and terms of our 2024 Term Loan Facility as of September 30, 2024:

 (2) Our 2024 Term Loan Facility interest rate was calculated using Adjusted SOFR plus a margin of 0.950 based on our credit rating as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, we incurred debt origination and legal costs in connection with the amendment and restatement of the unsecured revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, 1.6 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, inclusive of unamortized initial issuance costs transferred from the 2022 Term Loan Facility, remained to be amortized through the maturity date of the 2024 Term Loan Facility. 
 (3) The maturity date may be extended by two 12-month periods, at the Operating Partnership s election.

In September 2024, the Operating Partnership repaid the 120.0 million outstanding on its 2022 Term Loan Facility. The following table summarizes the balance and terms of our 2022 Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2023: 
 
 2022 Term Loan Facility December 31, 2023 (in thousands) Outstanding borrowings 520,000 Remaining borrowing capacity Total borrowing capacity 520,000 Interest rate (1)

 (2) Our undrawn facility fee was paid on a quarterly basis and was calculated based on the remaining borrowing capacity. In addition to the facility fee, we incurred debt origination and legal costs. As of December 31, 2023, 2.3 million of unamortized deferred financing costs remained to be amortized through the maturity date of our 2022 Term Loan Facility. 
 
 Capital Recycling Program 
 
 As discussed in the section Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations - Capital Recycling Program, we continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of non-core properties in our portfolio or the formation of strategic ventures with the intent of using the proceeds generated to acquire new operating and development properties, to finance development and redevelopment expenditures, to repay long-term debt, and for other general corporate purposes. As part of this strategy, we often attempt to enter into Section 1031 Exchanges, and other tax deferred transaction structures, when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales, if any, for federal and state income tax purposes. 
 
 The timing of any potential future disposition or strategic venture transactions will depend on market conditions and other factors, including but not limited to, our capital needs, the availability of financing for potential buyers (which has been and may continue to be constrained due to current economic and market conditions) and our ability to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales. We cannot assure you that we will dispose of any additional properties, enter into any additional strategic ventures, or that we will be able to identify and complete the acquisitions of suitable replacement properties to effect a Section 1031 Exchange or be able to use other tax deferred structures in connection with our strategy. In the event we are unable to complete dispositions as planned, we may raise capital through other sources of liquidity including our available unsecured revolving credit facility or the public or private issuance of unsecured debt. 
 
 Shelf Registration Statement 
 
 The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer and the Company and the Operating Partnership have an effective shelf registration statement that provides for the public offering and sale from time to time by the Company of its preferred stock, common stock, depository shares, and guarantees of debt securities and by the Operating Partnership of its debt securities, in each case in unlimited amounts. The Company evaluates the capital markets on an ongoing basis for opportunities to raise capital, and, as circumstances warrant, the Company and the Operating Partnership may issue securities of all of these types in one or more offerings at any time and from time to time on an opportunistic basis, depending upon, among other things, market conditions, available pricing, and capital needs. Capital raising could be more challenging under current market conditions as uncertainty related to interest rates, inflation rates, economic outlook, geopolitical events, and other factors have contributed and may continue to contribute to significant volatility and negative pressures in financial markets. When the Company receives proceeds from the sales of its preferred or common stock, it generally contributes the net proceeds from those sales to the Operating Partnership in exchange for corresponding preferred or common partnership units of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership may use these proceeds and proceeds from the sale of its debt securities to repay debt, including borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan facility, to develop new or redevelop existing properties, to make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties, or for general corporate purposes. 

49 

At-The-Market Stock Offering Program 
 
 In March 2024, the Company terminated its at-the-market ATM stock offering program (the 2018 ATM Program and commenced a new at-the-market stock offering program (the 2024 ATM ), under which we may currently offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price up to 500.0 million from time to time in at-the-market offerings. In connection with the 2024 ATM Program, the Company may also, at its discretion, enter into forward equity sale agreements. The use of forward equity sale agreements allows the Company to lock in a share price on the sale of shares of our common stock at the time an agreement is executed, but defer settling the forward equity sale agreements and receiving the proceeds from the sale of shares until a later date. The Company did not complete any sales of common stock under either program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Unsecured and Secured Debt 
 
 In January 2024, the Operating Partnership issued 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in a registered public offering. The outstanding balance of the unsecured senior notes is included in unsecured debt, net of an initial issuance discount of 4.5 million, on our consolidated balance sheets. The unsecured senior notes, which are scheduled to mature on January 15, 2036, require semi-annual interest payments each January and July based on a stated annual interest rate of 6.250 . The Operating Partnership may redeem the notes at any time, either in whole or in part, subject to the payment of an early redemption premium payable with respect to redemptions prior to October 15, 2035. On or after October 15, 2035, the Operating Partnership may redeem the notes at any time, either in whole or in part, at par. 
 
 The aggregate principal amount of the unsecured and secured debt of the Operating Partnership outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was as follows:

51 

Liquidity Uses 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 Refer to our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our contractual obligations. There have been no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to these contractual obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 other than the debt activity discussed under Liquidity Sources. 
 
 Other Liquidity Uses 
 
 Development 
 
 We believe we may spend between 50.0 million to 75.0 million on development projects throughout the remainder of 2024. The ultimate timing of these expenditures may fluctuate given construction progress and leasing status of the projects, or as a result of events outside our control, such as delays or increased costs as a result of heightened inflation and market conditions. We expect that any material additional development activities will be funded with borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility, the public or private issuance of debt or equity securities, the disposition of assets under our capital recycling program, or strategic venture opportunities. We cannot provide assurance that development projects will be completed on the terms, for the amounts, or on the timelines currently contemplated, or at all. 
 
 Debt Maturities 
 
 We believe our conservative leverage, staggered debt maturities and our unsecured revolving credit facility provide us with financial flexibility and enhance our ability to obtain additional sources of liquidity if necessary, and, therefore, we believe we are well-positioned to refinance or repay maturing debt and to pursue our strategy of seeking attractive acquisition opportunities, which we may finance, as necessary, with future public and private issuances of debt and equity securities. However, we can provide no assurance that we will have access to the public or private debt or equity markets in the future on favorable terms or at all. In March 2024, the Operating Partnership amended and restated the terms of its unsecured revolving credit facility to maintain the existing 1.1 billion borrowing capacity and extend the maturity date to July 31, 2028, repaid 200.0 million on its existing 520.0 million unsecured term loan facility (the 2022 Term Loan Facility and extended the maturity date on an aggregate principal amount of 200.0 million of the remaining 320.0 million by 12 months to October 3, 2025. In September 2024, the Operating Partnership repaid the 120.0 million outstanding on the 2022 Term Loan Facility. Our next debt maturity of 403.7 million occurs in December 2024. We may, however, repurchase certain of our unsecured senior notes from time to time prior to maturity (depending on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity, contractual restrictions and other factors) through cash purchases, open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. 
 
 Potential Future Leasing Costs and Capital Improvements 
 
 The amounts we incur for tenant improvements and leasing costs depend on leasing activity in each period. Tenant improvements and leasing costs generally fluctuate in any given period depending on factors such as the type and condition of the property, the term of the lease, the type of the lease, the involvement of external leasing agents and overall market conditions, including the level of inflation. Capital expenditures may fluctuate in any given period subject to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required to maintain our properties and may be impacted by inflationary pressures on the cost of construction materials. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 In February 2024, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program that authorizes the repurchase of shares of the Company s common stock having an aggregate gross purchase price of up to 500.0 million. The Share Repurchase Program supersedes and replaces the Company s existing share repurchase program. Under the Share Repurchase Program, repurchases may be made from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions. The specific timing, price and size of purchases will depend on prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions and other considerations. The Share Repurchase Program does not have a termination date and repurchases may be discontinued at any time. We did not repurchase any common stock under the Share Repurchase Program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 52 

Potential Future Acquisitions 
 
 As discussed in the section Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations - Acquisitions, we continue to evaluate strategic opportunities and remain a disciplined buyer of core, value-add and strategic operating properties, and land, dependent on market conditions and business cycles, among other factors. We focus on growth opportunities primarily in markets populated by knowledge and creative based tenants in a variety of industries, including technology, media, healthcare, life sciences, entertainment and professional services. We expect that any material acquisitions will be funded with borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility, the public or private issuance of debt or equity securities, the disposition of assets under our capital recycling program, the formation of strategic ventures or through the assumption of existing debt, although there can be no assurance in this regard. 
 
 We cannot provide assurance that we will enter into any agreements to acquire properties or undeveloped land, or that potential acquisitions contemplated by any agreements we may enter into in the future will be completed. 

53 

Factors That May Influence Future Sources of Capital and Liquidity of the Company and the Operating Partnership 
 
 We continue to evaluate sources of financing for our business activities, including borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility, the unsecured term loan facility, issuance of public and private equity securities, unsecured debt and fixed-rate secured mortgage financing, proceeds from the disposition of selective assets through our capital recycling program and the formation of strategic ventures. However, our ability to obtain new financing or refinance existing borrowings on favorable terms could be impacted by various factors, including the state of the macro economy, the state of the credit and equity markets, significant tenant defaults, a decline in the demand for office properties, a decrease in market rental rates or market values of real estate assets in our submarkets, the amount of our future borrowings and uncertainty related to interest rates, inflation rates, geopolitical events and other factors (refer to Part I, Item IA. Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information). These events could result in the following: 
 
 Decreases in our cash flows from operations, which could create further dependence on the unsecured revolving credit facility; 
 
 An increase in the proportion of variable-rate debt, which could increase our sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations in the future; and 
 
 A decrease in the value of our properties, which could have an adverse effect on the Operating Partnership s ability to incur additional debt, refinance existing debt at competitive rates, or comply with its existing debt obligations. 
 
 In addition to the factors noted above, the Operating Partnership s credit ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and may be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. In the event that the Operating Partnership s credit ratings are downgraded, we may incur higher borrowing costs and may experience difficulty in obtaining additional financing or refinancing existing indebtedness.

 The unsecured revolving credit facility, unsecured term loan facility, unsecured senior notes, and certain other secured debt arrangements contain covenants and restrictions requiring us to meet certain financial ratios and reporting requirements. Key existing financial covenants and their covenant levels include: 
 Unsecured Credit and Term Loan Facilities and Private Placement Notes (as defined in the applicable Credit Agreements): Covenant Level Actual Performance 
 as of September 30, 2024 
 Total debt to total asset value less than 60 33 Fixed charge coverage ratio greater than 1.5x 3.2x Unsecured debt ratio greater than 1.67x 3.08x Unencumbered asset pool debt service coverage greater than 1.75x 3.58x Unsecured Senior Notes due 2024, 2025, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2032, 2033, and 2036 (as defined in the applicable Indentures): Total debt to total asset value less than 60 37 Interest coverage greater than 1.5x 5.1x Secured debt to total asset value less than 40 4 Unencumbered asset pool value to unsecured debt greater than 150 282 
 
 The Operating Partnership was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. Our current expectation is that the Operating Partnership will continue to meet the requirements of its debt covenants in both the short and long term. However, in the event of an economic slowdown or continued volatility in the credit markets, there is no certainty that the Operating Partnership will be able to continue to satisfy all the covenant requirements.

Consolidated Historical Cash Flows Summary 
 
 The following summary discussion of our consolidated historical cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 1. Financial Statements and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. Changes in our cash flows include changes in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Our historical cash flows activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Dollar Change Percentage Change in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 432,912 492,366 (59,454) (12.1) Net cash used in investing activities (133,548) (660,477) 526,929 (79.8) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (184,132) 439,526 (623,658) (141.9) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 115,232 271,415 (156,183) (57.5) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Our cash flows from operating activities depends on numerous factors including the occupancy level of our portfolio, the rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent and recoveries from our tenants, the level of operating expenses, the impact of property acquisitions, completed development projects and related financing activities, and other general and administrative costs. See additional information under the caption Results of Operations. Our net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 59.5 million, or 12.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the retirement liability associated with our former CEO, who departed the Company in early 2024, as well as increased property tax payments made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Our cash flows from investing activities are generally used to fund development and operating property acquisitions, expenditures for development and redevelopment projects and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures for our operating properties, net of proceeds received from dispositions of real estate assets. Our net cash used in investing activities decreased by 526.9 million, or 79.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the maturity of certificates of deposit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Our cash flows from financing activities are principally impacted by our capital raising activities, net of dividends and distributions paid to common stockholders and common unitholders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net cash used in financing activities of 184.1 million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 439.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the 320 million repayment of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and a decrease in borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 55 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates. 
 
 In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified certain critical accounting policies that affect certain of our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. We have not made any material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the period covered by this report. 

Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measure: Funds From Operations FFO 
 
 We calculate Funds From Operations available to common stockholders and common unitholders FFO in accordance with the 2018 Restated White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of Nareit. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. The reconciling items include amounts to adjust earnings from consolidated partially-owned entities and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates to FFO. Our calculation of FFO includes the amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded tenant improvements and excludes the depreciation of the related tenant improvement assets. We also add back net income attributable to noncontrolling common units of the Operating Partnership because we report FFO attributable to common stockholders and common unitholders. 
 
 We believe that FFO is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. The exclusion from FFO of gains and losses from the sale of operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the assets that form the core of our activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. Also, because FFO is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operations of REITs, it facilitates comparisons of operating performance to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate FFO, and accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to all other REITs. 
 
 Implicit in historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP is the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, we believe that FFO along with the required GAAP presentations provides a more complete measurement of our performance relative to our competitors and a more appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities than the required GAAP presentations alone would provide. 
 
 However, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance because it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which are significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations. 

56 

The following table presents our FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net income available to common stockholders 52,378 52,762 151,509 164,957 Adjustments: Net income attributable to noncontrolling common units of the Operating Partnership 509 515 1,469 1,612 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated property partnerships 4,786 5,460 14,942 18,673 Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets 90,243 83,518 262,292 263,662 Funds From Operations attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated property partnerships (7,468) (8,208) (23,454) (27,045) Funds From Operations (1) (2)
