Sale of Digital Banking On August 6, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement with an affiliate of The Veritas Capital Fund VIII, L.P. (the Buyer pursuant to which the Buyer agreed to purchase the Company s Digital Banking segment businesses (the Digital Banking Sale ). On September 30, 2024, the Company completed the Digital Banking Sale pursuant to the purchase agreement. The purchase price for the transaction was billion in cash, subject to a post-closing adjustment, as well as contingent consideration of up to an additional million in cash upon the achievement of a specified return on the Buyer s invested capital at the time of any future sale. The Company records contingent consideration at fair value based on the consideration expected to be transferred, which was estimated to be zero as of September 30, 2024. The accounting requirements for reporting the Digital Banking Sale as a discontinued operation were met when the definitive agreement was signed. Accordingly, the financial results for Digital Banking for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 2, Discontinued Operations for additional information. In connection with the Digital Banking Sale, the Company and the Buyer entered into certain agreements, including a transition services agreement, providing for the performance of certain services by the Company for the benefit of the Buyer for a period of time after the Digital Banking Sale. 
 
 Transition of Hardware Business to ODM Model On August 6, 2024, the Company announced its entry into a commercial agreement with Ennoconn Corporation Ennoconn to transition its self-checkout and point-of-sale hardware businesses to an outsourced design and manufacturing model including the sale of certain assets relating to these businesses (the Hardware Business Transition ). Under the terms of the agreement, Ennoconn will design, manufacture, warrant, supply, and ship self-checkout and point-of sale hardware directly to the Company s customers and the Company will sell hardware to its customers as a sales agent for Ennoconn and continue to provide its point-of sale and self-checkout software as well as key support and maintenance services. As a result of the Hardware Business Transition, the Company expects to record commission revenue from point-of-sale and self-checkout hardware sales as an agent for Ennoconn on a net basis, excluding the costs paid to Ennoconn. While the Company and Ennoconn are targeting January 1, 2025 to implement the new hardware model, this date is dependent upon the migration of aspects of our hardware business to Ennoconn that are not yet complete. 
 
 Spin-off of NCR Atleos On October 16, 2023, the Company completed its separation of its ATM-focused business, including its self-service banking, payments network and telecommunications and technology businesses, through the spin-off of its wholly owned subsidiary, NCR Atleos Corporation NCR Atleos ), (the Spin-Off ). The Spin-Off was effected through a pro rata distribution of all outstanding shares of NCR Atleos common stock to holders of NCR Voyix common stock as of the close of business on October 2, 2023 (the record date ). The Company distributed one share of NCR Atleos common stock for every two common shares of NCR Voyix outstanding as of the record date. Shareholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares of Atleos common stock. The Spin-Off is expected to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes. NCR Atleos is an independent, publicly traded company focused on providing self-directed banking solutions to a global customer base, including financial institutions, retailers and consumers, and NCR Voyix retains no ownership interest. The accounting requirements for reporting the Spin-Off of NCR Atleos as a discontinued operation were met when the separation was completed. Accordingly, the financial results for NCR Atleos for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 2, Discontinued Operations for additional information.

Cyber ransomware incident On April 13, 2023, the Company determined that a single data center outage impacting certain of its commerce customers was caused by a cyber ransomware incident. Upon such determination, the Company immediately started contacting customers, enacted its cybersecurity protocol and engaged outside experts to contain the incident and begin the recovery process. The Company concluded that this incident impacted operations for some customers only with respect to specific Aloha cloud-based services and Counterpoint. Our investigation also concluded no financial reporting systems were impacted. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred million of expenses related to the cyber ransomware incident and has recovered million under our insurance policies. As of September 30, 2024, we expect to receive an additional million, which was recorded as an insurance receivable. We are still pursuing insurance recoveries for the remaining costs. We may incur additional costs relating to this incident in the future, including expenses to respond to this matter, payment of damages or other costs to customers or others. At this time we do not believe additional costs incurred as a result of the incident will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition; however, we remain subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the incident. 
 
 Out-of-period adjustments In the first quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a million out-of-period adjustment to increase operating expenses and an employee-related liability in order to correct for an understatement of such same balances during the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded an out-of-period correction to decrease revenue by million, decrease accounts receivable by million, and increase contract liabilities by million. The adjustment is not expected to be material to the full year results of operations for 2024. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded corrections related to the Spin-Off. As of December 31, 2023, total assets were understated by approximately million, total liabilities were overstated by approximately million, and total equity was understated by approximately million, which is included in the Spin-Off of NCR Atleos line in the Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity (Deficit). 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded an out-of-period correction related to foreign currency to increase other expense, net by approximately million, increase other current liabilities by million and increase accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income by million.

 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recovered approximately million of fraudulent disbursements from the Company s banks and is pursuing insurance recoveries in connection with this matter. 
 
 In preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company identified incorrectly recorded ACH disbursements for the quarterly periods ending March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 in an accounts receivable clearing account instead of as operating expenses. The Company evaluated the impact of these errors and concluded that they were not material to any previously issued financial statements. As a result of these errors, the Company has made adjustments to the prior period amounts presented in these financial statements. The impact of the revisions to the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 are presented in Note 17, Revised 2023 Quarterly Financial Statements .

 Corporate and Other includes income and expenses related to corporate functions that are not specifically attributable to any of our individual reportable segments along with certain non-strategic businesses that are considered immaterial operating segment(s) and certain countries which are expected to transfer to NCR Atleos during the remainder of 2024, as well as commercial agreements with NCR Atleos. 
 
 These segments represent components of the Company for which separate financial information is available that is utilized on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker in assessing segment performance and in allocating the Company s resources. Management evaluates the performance of the segments based on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to NCR Voyix plus interest expense, net; plus income tax expense (benefit); plus depreciation and amortization; plus stock-based compensation expense; plus other income (expense); plus pension mark-to-market adjustments and other special items, including amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related costs, separation-related costs, cyber ransomware incident recovery costs net of insurance recoveries, fraudulent ACH disbursements costs, net of recoveries, transformation and restructuring charges (which includes integration, severance and other exit and disposal costs), and strategic initiative costs, among others. The special items are considered non-operational or non-recurring in nature, so are excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA metric utilized by our chief operating decision maker in evaluating segment performance and are separately delineated to reconcile back to total reported GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to the Company. 
 
 Assets are not allocated to segments, and thus are not included in the assessment of segment performance. Consequently, we do not disclose total assets by reportable segment. The accounting policies used to determine the results of the operating segments are the same as those utilized for the condensed consolidated financial statements as a whole. Intersegment sales and transfers are not material.

 term loan A facility in the aggregate principal amount of million (the Term Loan A Facility, and the loans thereunder, the Term A Loans and, the Term Loan A Facility, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities ). 
 
 The Term A Loans and the Revolving Loans (collectively, the Loans bear interest based on SOFR (or an alternative reference rate for amounts denominated in a currency other than Dollars), or, at the Company s option, in the case of amounts denominated in Dollars, at a base reference rate equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus , (b) the rate of interest last quoted by the Administrative Agent as its prime rate and (c) the one-month SOFR rate plus (the Base Rate ), plus, as applicable, a margin ranging from to per annum for SOFR-based Loans and ranging from to per annum for Base Rate-based Loans, in each case, depending on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio. 
 
 The outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan A Facility was required to be repaid in quarterly installments beginning March 31, 2024 in an amount equal to (i) of the original principal amount of the Term A Loans during the first and (ii) of the original principal amount of the Term A Loans during final . Any remaining outstanding balance will be due at maturity on October 16, 2028. The Revolving Credit Facility is not subject to amortization and will mature on October 16, 2028. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, using a portion of the proceeds from the Digital Banking Sale, the Company repaid all loans outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (but did not reduce the principal amount of the commitments under the Revolving Loans). 
 
 The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain of the Company s material subsidiaries (the Guarantors ). The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the above described guarantee are secured by a first priority lien and security interest in certain equity interests owned by the Company and the Guarantors in certain of their respective domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and a first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, subject to certain exclusions. 
 
 The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, and negative covenants. The negative covenants limit the Company s and its subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, create liens on the Company s or its subsidiaries assets, engage in fundamental changes, make investments, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, engage in sale-leaseback transactions, make restricted payments, repay subordinated indebtedness, engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into agreements restricting the ability of the Company s subsidiaries to make distributions to the Company or incur liens on their assets. 
 
 The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain a financial covenant that does not permit the Company to allow its consolidated leverage ratio to exceed (i) in the case of any fiscal quarter ending on or prior to September 30, 2024, to 1.00, (ii) in the case of any fiscal quarter ending on or following September 30, 2024 and prior to September 30, 2025, to 1.00 and (iii) in the case of any fiscal quarter ending on or following September 30, 2025, to 1.00, in each case subject, to (x) increases of in connection with the consummation of any material acquisition and applicable to the fiscal quarter in which such acquisition is consummated and the three consecutive fiscal quarters thereafter, and (y) a maximum cap of to 1.00. 
 
 The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also include provisions for events of default, which are customary for similar financings. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders may, among other things, terminate the loan commitments, accelerate all loans and require cash collateral deposits in respect of outstanding letters of credit. If the Company is unable to pay or repay the amounts due, the lenders could, among other things, proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. 
 
 Senior Unsecured Notes On August 20, 2020, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2028 (the Notes and million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2030 (the Notes ).

 On April 6, 2021, the Company issued billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the Notes ). Interest is payable on the Notes semi-annually in arrears at annual rates of on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The Notes will mature on April 15, 2029. 
 The Company has the option to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on or after April 15, 2024, at a redemption price of , and during the 12-month periods commencing on or after April 15, 2024, 2025 and 2026 and thereafter, respectively, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. 
 The senior unsecured notes are the Company s senior unsecured obligations and are jointly and severally unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company s domestic material subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations, that guarantee the Company s Senior Secured Credit Facilities pursuant to supplemental indentures governing each applicable series of senior unsecured notes. The indentures governing the senior unsecured notes contain customary events of default, including, among other things, payment default, exchange default, failure to provide certain notices thereunder and certain provisions related to bankruptcy events. The indentures governing the senior unsecured notes also contains customary high yield affirmative and negative covenants, including negative covenants that, among other things, limit the Company and its restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens on, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, engage in certain fundamental corporate changes or changes to lines of business activities, make certain investments or material acquisitions, engage in sale-leaseback or hedging transactions, repurchase common stock, pay dividends or make similar distributions on capital stock, repay certain indebtedness, engage in certain affiliate transactions and enter into agreements that restrict their ability to create liens, pay dividends or make loan repayments. If the senior unsecured notes are assigned an investment grade rating by Moody s or S P and no default has occurred or is continuing, certain covenants will be terminated. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, a portion of the proceeds from the Digital Banking Sale were used to settle the Company s previously announced tender offers to purchase up to billion aggregate purchase price, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, of the Company s senior unsecured notes, subject to prioritized acceptance levels and proration. Pursuant to the terms of the tender offers and the final settlement, the Company purchased approximately million aggregate principal amount of the Notes and million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of million related to the redemption discount of million on the settlement of the Notes and Notes offset by the write-off of the related deferred financing fees of million. 
 
 Fair Value of Debt The Company utilized Level 2 inputs, as defined in the fair value hierarchy, to measure the fair value of the long-term debt, which, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was billion and billion, respectively. Management s fair value estimates were based on quoted prices for recent trades of the Company s long-term debt, quoted prices for similar instruments, and inquiries with certain investment communities.

The actual outstanding balance of trade receivables that were sold varied based on the level of activity and other factors and could be less than the maximum purchase commitment. The total outstanding balance of trade receivables that were sold to the Purchasers and derecognized by the U.S. SPE was approximately and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 million supersedeas bond, which is an amount the Company believes may not be correlated to the actual loss (if any). On September 12, 2024, the supersedeas bond was filed and a stay was issued. Any amount sustained following an appeal of this matter is subject to an indemnity obligation by NCR Atleos to contribute of any award. The Company has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, a loss is reasonably possible but that an estimate or range of possible loss cannot be determined at this time given uncertainty regarding the ultimate form of relief and complexities in the methodology and quantification of damages, if any. 
 
 Environmental Matters The Company s facilities and operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws, and the Company has investigatory and remedial activities underway at a number of facilities that it currently owns or operates, or formerly owned or operated, to comply, or to determine compliance, with such laws. Also, the Company has been identified, either by a government agency or by a private party seeking contribution to site clean-up costs, as a potentially responsible party PRP at a number of sites pursuant to various state and federal laws, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA and comparable state statutes. Following the Spin-Off, the Company will retain the responsibility to manage the identified environmental liabilities and remediations, subject however to an indemnity obligation by NCR Atleos to contribute of the costs of certain environmental liabilities after an annual million funding threshold is met. Other than the Kalamazoo River matter discussed below, we currently do not anticipate material expenses and liabilities from these environmental matters. 
 
 Fox River The Company was one of eight entities that was formally notified by governmental and other entities that it was a PRP for environmental claims (under CERCLA and other statutes) arising out of the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs in sediments in the lower Fox River and in the Bay of Green Bay in Wisconsin. The Company was identified as a PRP because of alleged PCB discharges from two carbonless copy paper manufacturing facilities it previously owned, which were located along the Fox River, and carbonless copy paper broke the Company allegedly sold to other mills as raw material. In 2017, the Company entered into a Consent Decree with the federal and state governments for the clean-up of the Fox River, which was approved on August 22, 2017 by the federal district court in Wisconsin presiding over this matter. The Consent Decree resolved the Company s disputes with the enforcement agencies as well as the other PRPs.

of the cost of the Fox River clean-up and natural resource damages NRD ). Pursuant to a September 30, 2014 Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement ), BAT funded of the Company s Fox River remediation costs from October 1, 2014 forward. The Funding Agreement also provides the Company contractual avenues for a future payment of, via direct and third-party sources, (1) the difference between BAT s obligation under the Cost Sharing Agreement on the one hand and their ongoing (since September 2014) payments under the Funding Agreement on the other, and (2) the difference between the amount the Company received under the Funding Agreement and the amount owed to it under the Cost Sharing Agreement for the period from April 2012 through September 2014 (collectively, the Funding Agreement Receivable ). Pursuant to a 2015 Letter Agreement, the Company s contractual avenue for direct payment by BAT was effectively stayed pending completion of other unrelated lawsuits by BAT against third-parties. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Funding Agreement Receivable was approximately million and was included in Other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The timing of collection of sums related to the receivable is uncertain, subject and pursuant to the terms of the Funding Agreement and related agreements. This receivable is not taken into account in calculating the Company s Fox River remaining reserve. 
 
 Additionally, under a 1996 Divestiture Agreement, the Company, AT T and Nokia have mutual several (not joint) responsibility for indemnifying each other for certain environmental matters, including the Fox River and the Kalamazoo River discussed below, after defined dollar expenditures are met. AT T and Nokia have been reimbursing the Company for certain portions of the amounts paid by the Company for the Fox River matter over the defined threshold for Fox River subject to certain offsets for insurance recoveries and net tax benefits (the Divestiture Agreement Offsets ). The Divestiture Agreement governs certain aspects of AT T s divestiture of the Company and Lucent Technologies. Those companies have generally made the payments requested of them by the Company on an ongoing basis. The Company, AT T and Nokia are currently discussing a final reconciliation of the Divestiture Agreement Offsets, but the timing for a final resolution is uncertain. 
 
 The final reconciliation of the Funding Agreement Receivable and the Divestiture Agreement Offsets could result in additional expenditures and liabilities for the Company that could be material. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have remaining liability for environmental remedial obligations for the Fox River matter. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the liability subject to final reconciliation with indemnitors under the Divestiture Agreement was approximately million. 
 
 Kalamazoo River In November 2010, The United States Environmental Protection Agency USEPA issued a general notice letter to the Company with respect to the Allied Paper, Inc./Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River Superfund Site Kalamazoo River site in Michigan. other companies - International Paper, Mead Corporation, and Consumers Energy - also received general notice letters at or about the same time. USEPA asserts that the site is contaminated by various substances, primarily PCBs, as a result of discharges by various paper mills located along the river. USEPA does not claim that the Company made direct discharges into the Kalamazoo River, and the Company never had facilities at or near the Kalamazoo River site, but USEPA indicated that NCR may be liable under Section 107 of CERCLA ... as an arranger, who by contract or agreement, arranged for the disposal, treatment and/or transportation of hazardous substances at the Site. USEPA stated that it may issue special notice letters to [NCR] and other PRPs for future RI/FS [remedial investigation / feasibility studies] and RD/RA [remedial design / remedial action] negotiations. 
 
 In connection with the Kalamazoo River site, in December 2010 the Company, along with other defendants, was sued in federal court by Georgia Pacific GP affiliate corporations in a private-party contribution and cost recovery action for alleged pollution. The suit sought to require that the Company and other defendants pay a fair portion of these companies costs and also alleged that the Company was liable to the GP entities as an arranger under CERCLA. The initial phase of the case was tried in a Michigan federal court in February 2013 and in September 2013 the court issued a decision that held the Company was liable as an arranger as of at least March 1969 (PCB-containing carbonless copy paper was produced from approximately 1954 to April 1971, and the majority of contamination at the Kalamazoo River site had occurred prior to 1969).

 million (GP had sought approximately million, but million of those claims were removed by the court upon motions filed by the Company and other parties). The Company and GP were each assigned a share of those costs, and the other companies were assigned and as their allocations. The court entered a judgment in the case in June 2018, in which it indicated that it would not allocate future costs, but would enter a declaratory judgment that the four companies together had responsibility for future costs, in amounts and shares to be determined. In July 2018, the Company appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit both the 2013 court decision and the 2018 court decision. 
 
 During the pendency of the Sixth Circuit appeal, the Company negotiated a settlement of the Kalamazoo River matter with the USEPA and other government agencies. In December 2019, the Company entered into a Consent Decree and in December 2020, the District Court approved the Consent Decree, which resolved the foregoing litigation associated with the Kalamazoo River clean-up, including the Sixth Circuit appeal. The Consent Decree requires the Company to pay GP its share of past costs, to pay the USEPA and state agencies their past and future administrative costs. It also required the Company to dismiss its Sixth Circuit appeal. The Consent Decree further requires the Company to take responsibility for the remediation of a portion, but not all, of the Kalamazoo River. The Consent Decree provides the Company protection from other PRPs, including GP, seeking contribution for their costs associated with the clean-up anywhere on the river, thereby resolving the allocation of future costs left unresolved by the June 2018 judgment. 
 
 The Company believes it has meritorious claims to recover certain Kalamazoo River remediation expenses from BAT under the Cost Sharing Agreement, discussed above, as the river is a future site under the agreement. To date, BAT disputes that the 
 Kalamazoo River is a future site. In February 2023, the Company filed an action against BAT in the Southern District of New York seeking a declaration that the Kalamazoo River is a future site under the Cost Sharing Agreement. In June 2023, BAT filed an answer asserting counterclaims in the proceedings. On September 14, 2024, the Court entered an opinion stating that the Kalamazoo River is a future site within the meaning of the Cost Sharing Agreement. The case remains pending with respect to BAT s remaining counterclaims and affirmative defenses. 
 
 In December 2022, the Company met the contractual threshold set forth in the 1996 Divestiture Agreement and as a result also has indemnity or reimbursement claims against AT T and Nokia. 
 
 In November 2023, the USEPA issued a conditional approval for a work plan to remediate one area of the Kalamazoo River (referred to by USEPA as Area 4) for which the Company has remediation responsibility. The conditional approval provided the Company with sufficient information to estimate the cost of the first phase of remediation for this area of the river and necessitated an increase in the Kalamazoo reserve. Subsequently, USEPA provided further clarification about the conditions with respect to completing the second phase of the work plan that could substantially increase the costs of remediation. The Company does not believe the scope of work for this second phase is its responsibility under the Consent Decree or the National Contingency Plan. On March 29, 2024, the Company filed a Notice of Dispute with the USEPA objecting to the scope of work for Area 4 as being inconsistent with the National Contingency Plan and contrary to the requirements of the Consent Decree. In June 2024, the Company reached a tentative agreement with the USEPA that will satisfactorily address the Company s cost concerns and in October 2024, the Company submitted a work plan to the USEPA for approval. In connection with the submittal of the work plan, an updated engineering estimate was developed, which necessitated an increase in the Kalamazoo reserve. The submitted work plan is subject to USEPA approval and if an Area 4 work plan cannot be finalized, the costs to remediate Area 4 could increase substantially. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total reserve for Kalamazoo was million and million, respectively. The reserve is reported on a basis that is net of expected contributions from the Company s co-obligors and indemnitors, subject to when the applicable threshold is reached. While the Company believes its co-obligors and indemnitors obligations are as previously reported, the reserve may be adjusted from time to time to reflect changes in our estimates of remediation costs and recoverability from co-obligors and indemnitors with respect to the Kalamazoo River. 
 
 As many aspects of the costs of remediation will not be determined for several years (and thus the high end of a range of possible costs for many areas of the site cannot be quantified at this time), the Company has made what it considers to be reasonable estimates of the low end of a range for such costs where remedies are identified, and/or of the costs of investigations and studies for areas of the river where remedies have not yet been determined, and the reserve is informed by those estimates. The extent of the Company s potential liability remains subject to many uncertainties, notwithstanding the settlement of this matter and related Consent Decree noted above, particularly in as much as remedy decisions and cost estimates will not be generated until times in the future and as most of the work to be performed will take place through the 2030s. Under other assumptions or estimates for possible costs of remediation, which the Company does not at this point consider to be reasonably

 million in settlements reached with various of its insurance carriers. Some of the settlements cover not only the Fox River but also other environmental sites; some are limited to either the Fox River or the Kalamazoo River site. Some of the settlements are directed to defense costs and some are directed to indemnity; some settlements cover both defense costs and indemnity. The Company does not anticipate that further material insurance recoveries specific to Kalamazoo River remediation costs will be available to it, but it has recovered some amounts as a result of settlement discussions with certain carriers. Claims with respect to Kalamazoo River defense costs have now been settled, with the amounts of those settlements included in the sum reported above. 
 
 Environmental Remediation Estimates It is difficult to estimate the future financial impact of environmental laws, including potential liabilities. The Company records environmental provisions when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount or range of the liability is reasonably estimable; in accordance with accounting guidance, where liabilities are not expected to be quantifiable or estimable for a period of years, the estimated costs of investigating those liabilities are recorded as a component of the reserve for that particular site. Provisions for estimated losses from environmental restoration and remediation are, depending on the site, based generally on internal and third-party environmental studies, estimates as to the number and participation level of other PRPs, the extent of contamination, estimated amounts for attorney and other fees, and the nature of required clean-up and restoration actions. Reserves are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Management expects that the amounts reserved from time to time will be paid out over the period of investigation, negotiation, remediation and restoration for the applicable sites. The amounts provided for environmental matters in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are the estimated gross undiscounted amounts of such liabilities, without deductions for indemnity insurance, third-party indemnity claims or recoveries from other PRPs, except in the event certain criteria supporting the probability of receipt of payment from such third parties is met, the amounts are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For the Fox River and Kalamazoo River sites, as described above, assets relating to the AT T and Nokia indemnities and to the BAT obligations are recorded as payment is supported by contractual agreements, public filings and/or payment history. 
 
 Guarantees and Product Warranties In the ordinary course of business, the Company may issue performance guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries to certain of its customers and other parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit, surety bonds, or similar instruments. In general, under the guarantees, the Company would be obligated to perform, or cause performance, over the term of the underlying contract in the event of an unexcused, uncured breach by its subsidiary, or some other specified triggering event, in each case as defined by the applicable guarantee. The Company believes the likelihood of having to perform under any such guarantee is remote. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no material obligations related to such guarantees, and therefore its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not have any associated liability balance. 
 
 The Company provides its customers a standard manufacturer s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs. Estimated future obligations due to warranty claims are based upon historical factors, such as labor rates, average repair time, travel time, number of service calls per machine and cost of replacement parts. When a sale is consummated, the total customer revenue is recognized, provided that all revenue recognition criteria are otherwise satisfied, and the associated warranty liability is recorded using pre-established warranty percentages for the respective product classes. Warranty reserve liabilities are presented in Other current liabilities and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 From time to time, product design or quality corrections are accomplished through modification programs. When identified, associated costs of labor and parts for such programs are estimated and accrued as part of the warranty reserve. 
 
 In addition, the Company provides its customers with certain indemnification rights, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. In some cases, the Company agrees to defend and indemnify its customers from third-party lawsuits alleging patent or other infringement of Company solutions based on its customers use of them. On limited occasions the Company will undertake to indemnify a customer for business, rather than contractual, reasons. From time to time, the Company also enters into agreements in connection with its acquisition and divestiture activities that include indemnification obligations by the Company. The fair value of these indemnification obligations is not readily determinable due to the conditional nature of the Company s potential obligations, certain limitations to liability and indemnity exclusions that appear in certain of the

 functional currencies. Our results can be significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company seeks to mitigate such impact by hedging its foreign currency transaction exposure using foreign currency forward and option contracts. We do not enter into hedges for speculative purposes. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge our exposure of assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. We recognize the gains and losses on these types of hedges in earnings as exchange rates change. 
 
 Historically, our risk management strategy included hedging, on behalf of certain subsidiaries, a portion of our forecasted, non-functional currency denominated cash flows for a period of up to months. If the hedge was designated as a highly effective cash flow hedge, the gains or losses were deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI ). The gains or losses from derivative contracts that were designated as highly effective cash flow hedges related to inventory purchases were recorded in cost of products when the inventory is sold to an unrelated third party. Otherwise, they were recorded in earnings when the exchange rates change. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance in AOCI related to foreign exchange derivative transactions was . 
 
 The accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company designates foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions when they are determined to be highly effective at inception. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk We historically utilized interest rate swap contracts or interest rate cap agreements to add stability to interest cost and to manage exposure to interest rate movements as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. 
 
 The Company designates Interest Rate Derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions when they are determined to be highly effective at inception. Payments and receipts related to Interest Rate Derivatives are included in cash flows from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 The Company is potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk on accounts receivable and financial instruments such as hedging instruments and cash and cash equivalents. Credit risk includes the risk of nonperformance by counterparties. The maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Exposure to credit risk is managed through credit approvals, credit limits, selecting major international financial institutions as counterparties to hedging transactions and monitoring procedures. The Company s business often involves large transactions with customers, and if one or more of those customers were to default on its obligations under applicable contractual arrangements, the Company could be exposed to potentially significant losses. However, management believes that the reserves for potential losses are adequate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any major concentration of credit risk related to financial instruments.

Prior to the Digital Banking Sale, described below, on September 30, 2024, our offerings included digital solutions for financial institutions. 
 
 Sale of Digital Banking Business 
 
 On August 6, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement with an affiliate of The Veritas Capital Fund VIII, L.P. (the Buyer pursuant to which the Buyer agreed to purchase the Company s Digital Banking segment businesses (the Digital Banking Sale ). On September 30, 2024, the Company completed the Digital Banking Sale. The purchase price for the transaction was 2.45 billion in cash, subject to a post-closing adjustment, as well as contingent consideration of up to an additional 100 million in cash upon the achievement of a specified return on the Buyer s invested capital at the time of any future sale. The accounting requirements for reporting the sale of Digital Banking as a discontinued operation were met when the definitive agreement was signed. Accordingly, the financial results for Digital Banking for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 2, Discontinued Operations for additional information. 
 
 Transition of Hardware Business to ODM Model 
 
 On August 6, 2024, the Company announced its entry into a commercial agreement with Ennoconn Corporation Ennoconn to transition its self-checkout and point-of-sale hardware businesses to an outsourced design and manufacturing model including the sale of certain assets relating to these businesses (the Hardware Business Transition ). Under the terms of the agreement, Ennoconn will design, manufacture, warrant, supply, and ship self-checkout and point-of sale hardware directly to the Company s customers and the Company will sell hardware to its customers as a sales agent for Ennoconn and continue to provide its point-of sale and self-checkout software as well as key support and maintenance services.

Table of Contents 

 As a result of the Hardware Business Transition, the Company expects to record commission revenue from point-of-sale and self-checkout hardware sales as an agent for Ennoconn on a net basis, excluding the costs paid to Ennoconn. While the Company and Ennoconn are targeting January 1, 2025 to implement the new hardware model, this date is dependent upon the migration of aspects of our hardware business to Ennoconn that are not yet complete. 
 
 Completion of NCR Atleos Spin-Off Transaction 
 
 On October 16, 2023, the Company completed the spin-off Spin-Off of its ATM-focused businesses, including the self-service banking, payments network and telecommunications and technology businesses, into an independent, publicly traded company, NCR Atleos NCR Atleos ), on a tax-free basis. Accordingly, the historical financial results of NCR Atleos are reflected as discontinued operations in the Company s consolidated financial statements. The 2023 presentation of discontinued operations has been updated to reflect the results of operations for the countries that transferred to NCR Atleos in the first quarter of 2024 and excludes the countries that have not yet transferred to NCR Atleos as of September 30, 2024. The results of operations for the countries that have not yet transferred will be presented as part of discontinued operations as of the date of their separation. As of December 31, 2023, there were seven countries that had not yet transferred to NCR Atleos.

In addition, we deliver service support, allowing our customers to focus on their core competencies. Our end-to-end services are a strong differentiating factor within the market. 
 
 Corporate and Other includes income and expenses related to corporate functions that are not specifically attributable to any of our two individual reportable segments along with certain non-strategic businesses that are considered immaterial operating segment(s) and certain countries which are expected to transfer to NCR Atleos during the remainder of 2024, as well as commercial agreements with NCR Atleos. 

SIGNIFICANT THEMES AND EVENTS 
 
 The following were significant themes and events for the third quarter of 2024. 
 Revenue of 711 million, down 12 compared to the prior year period 
 Recurring revenue, remained flat as compared to the prior year period and comprised 57 of total consolidated revenue 
 Software and services revenue, decreased 4 as compared to the prior year period and comprised 73 of total consolidated revenue 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 93 million, down 10 compared to the prior year period 
 
 Cyber Ransomware Incident 
 
 As previously disclosed, on April 13, 2023 the Company determined that a single data center outage impacting certain of its commerce customers was caused by a cyber ransomware incident. Upon such determination, the Company immediately started contacting customers, enacted its cybersecurity protocol and engaged outside experts to contain the incident and begin the recovery process. We concluded that this incident impacted operations for some customers only with respect to specific Aloha

 cloud-based services and Counterpoint. Our investigation also concluded no financial reporting systems were impacted. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred 46 million of expenses related to the cyber ransomware incident and has recovered 21 million under our insurance policies. As of September 30, 2024, we expect to receive an additional 6 million which was recorded as an insurance receivable. We are still pursuing insurance recoveries for the remaining costs. We may incur additional costs relating to this incident in the future, including expenses to respond to this matter, payment of damages or other costs to customers or others. At this time we do not believe additional costs incurred as a result of the incident will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition; however, we remain subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the incident. 
 
 Out-of-period adjustments 
 
 In the first quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a 10 million out-of-period adjustment to increase operating expenses and an employee-related liability in order to correct for an understatement of such same balances during the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded an out-of-period correction to decrease revenue by 10 million, decrease accounts receivable by 5 million, and increase contract liabilities by 5 million. The adjustment is not expected to be material to the full year results of operations for 2024. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded corrections related to the Spin-Off. As of December 31, 2023, total assets were understated by approximately 12 million, total liabilities were overstated by approximately 7 million, and total equity was understated by approximately 19 million. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded an out-of-period correction to increase other income expense by approximately 8 million, increase other current liabilities by 4 million and increase accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income by 4 million. 
 
 The aggregation of the remaining 2024 out-of-period corrections are not expected to be material to the full year results of operations for 2024. The Company evaluated the impact of these adjustments and concluded they were not material to any previously issued interim or annual consolidated financial statements. 
 
 ACH Disbursements 
 
 In February 2024, the Company identified fraudulent automated clearing house ACH disbursements from a Company bank account. The cumulative amount of these disbursements total 34 million, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recovered 15 million related to this matter. The Company is pursuing insurance recoveries for the remainder; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in recovering additional amounts of the unauthorized ACH disbursements from the Company s insurance providers. Although not materially impacting any previously reported periods, the misstatements resulted in the revision of interim periods in 2023. 

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND TRENDS 
 
 As a leading technology company, we seek to maintain our market position by expanding our share of wallet among existing customers and attracting new customers, leveraging our cloud-based, platform-enabled software and services offerings. We believe there is considerable opportunity to grow with new and existing customers as retailers and restaurants are increasingly adopting technology and support services to enhance and transform their operations. As digital adoption becomes increasingly important for businesses to engage with their end-users, we are investing in innovation to attract and retain customers across our segments. Our ability to create experiences that ultimately improve end-user satisfaction through a combination of innovation and service is a competitive strength of the Company. In order to provide long-term value to all our stakeholders, we set complementary business goals and financial strategies. Execution of these is driven by the following key pillars: (i) focus on our customers; (ii) leverage our brand (and global distribution); (iii) support customers through innovation; and (iv) allocate our capital strategically through a cost-disciplined approach to operations. We also plan to continue to improve our execution to drive solid returns and to transform our business to enhance value for all stockholders. 

Macroeconomic Trends 
 
 Given the multinational nature of our business, we are subject to risks and exposures from the evolving macroeconomic environment, including the effects of increased global inflationary pressures and interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, political economic slowdowns or recessions and geopolitical pressures, including the unknown impacts of 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 current and future trade regulations. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape. For example, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our financial results during the reporting period. 
 
 As we continue to execute on our strategy to shift to recurring revenue, our revenues and earnings will become more predictable; however, the broader implications of these macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall financial position, particularly in the short term, remain uncertain. 
 
 For further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results, refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors , contained in our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent filings we make within the SEC.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Use of Certain Terms: 
 
 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization Adjusted EBITDA Our management uses the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA because it provides useful information to investors as an indicator of strength and performance of the Company s ongoing business operations, including funding discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and other investments. We determine Adjusted EBITDA based on GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to NCR Voyix plus interest expense, net; plus income tax expense (benefit); plus depreciation and amortization (excluding acquisition-related amortization of intangibles); plus stock-based compensation expense; plus other income (expense); plus pension mark-to-market adjustments and other special items, including amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related costs, loss (gain) on disposal of businesses, separation-related costs, cyber ransomware incident recovery costs, net of insurance recoveries, fraudulent ACH disbursements costs, net of recoveries, foreign currency devaluation, transformation and restructuring charges (which includes integration, severance and other exit and disposal costs), and strategic initiative costs, among others. The special items are considered non-operational or non-recurring in nature, so are excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA metric utilized by our chief operating decision maker in evaluating segment performance and are separately delineated to reconcile back to total reported income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to NCR Voyix. This format is useful to investors because it allows analysis and comparability of operating trends. It also includes the same information that is used by our management to make decisions regarding the segments and to assess our financial performance. Refer to the table below for the reconciliations of net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to NCR Voyix (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP). 
 
 Our definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly-titled measures reported by other companies and cannot, therefore, be compared with similarly-titled measures of other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, results determined in accordance with GAAP.

 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Retail Adjusted EBITDA decreased 12 for both of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for both periods is due to one-time software and services revenue recognized in the prior year. 
 
 Restaurants Adjusted EBITDA increased 27 and 24 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. This increase is due to favorable software and services revenue mix, along with cost mitigation actions around cost of goods and service delivery costs taken during the year. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are to fund: (i) normal operating expenses; (ii) interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; (iii) capital expenditures and operating lease payments; (iv) remediation payments related to environmental matters; (v) expected pension and postemployment plan contributions; and (vi) payments related to transformation and restructuring initiatives. We believe these needs will be satisfied in both the short and long term based on our current cash position, cash flows generated by our operations, and existing financing arrangements. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 795 million and our total debt was 1.1 billion. Our borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities was 478 million as of September 30, 2024. Our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions, and the competitive environment in our industry, and is subject to business and other risk factors, including as detailed in our filings with the SEC. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or otherwise comply with the terms of our credit facilities, we may be required to seek additional financing alternatives. 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine months ended September 30 In millions 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 38 727 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 2,017 (305) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,496) 1,879 
 
 The following table summarizes information related to cash flows from discontinued operations related to the Digital Banking Sale and the Spin-Off of NCR Atleos: 
 In millions Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (299) 611 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (57) (165) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
 
 Net cash provided by or used in operating activities of discontinued operations related to environmental obligations was cash used in operating activities of 4 million and cash used in operating activities 1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was 38 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash provided by operating activities of 727 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was driven by discontinued operations, movement in the net working capital accounts and employee related payments in 2024. 
 
 Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities Our principal capital expenditures are for software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property and equipment. We invested approximately 178 million and 306 million in capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to continue investing in property and equipment, purchased software and internally developed software to support our business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company disposed of certain corporate-owned life insurance policies and received proceeds of 30 million. Additionally, the Company paid 300 million to terminate its trade receivables facility and reacquire

 all of the outstanding trade receivables that had previously been sold by it during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 6, Trade Receivables Facility of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 
 Financing Activities Financing activities mainly relate to borrowings and repayments under our senior secured credit facilities as well as our unsecured senior notes. Financing activities also included dividends paid on the Series A preferred stock, proceeds from employee stock plans as well as tax withholding payments on behalf of employees for stock based awards that vested. 
 
 Adjusted free cash flow NCR Voyix management uses a non-GAAP measure called adjusted free cash flow-unrestricted to assess the financial performance of the Company. We define adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, less additions to capitalized software, plus/minus collections of previously sold trade receivables purchased from third parties, restricted cash settlement activity, NCR Atleos settlement activity, cash activity related to environmental discontinued operations plus acquisition-related items, and plus pension contributions and settlements. NCR Atleos settlement activity relates to changes in amounts owed to and amounts due from NCR Atleos for activity related to items governed by the separation and distribution agreement. Activity from the commercial and transition services agreements are not included in this adjustment. 
 
 We believe adjusted free cash flow-unrestricted information is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flows from the Company s continuing and discontinued operations to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations. In particular, adjusted free cash flow indicates the amount of cash available after capital expenditures for, among other things, investments in the Company s existing businesses, strategic acquisitions, and repayment of debt obligations. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since there may be other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. Adjusted free cash flow does not have a uniform definition under GAAP, and therefore the Company s definition may differ from other companies definitions of this measure. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, cash flows from operating activities under GAAP. 
 
 The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to NCR Voyix s non-GAAP measure of adjusted free cash flow-unrestricted for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 In millions Nine months ended September 30, 2024 (1) 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (GAAP) 38 Expenditures for property, plant and equipment (23) Additions to capitalized software (155) Restricted cash settlement activity 5 NCR Atleos settlement activity (6) Pension contributions 7 Collections on purchased trade receivables 7 Cash activity related to environmental discontinued operations 4 Adjusted free cash flow-unrestricted (non-GAAP) (123) 
 (1) Adjusted free cash flow-unrestricted for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is not meaningful for comparison purposes given the presentation of cash flows due to the Spin-Off of NCR Atleos. 
 
 Long Term Borrowings The senior secured credit facilities include a term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of 200 million, of which the Company repaid in full as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, the senior secured credit facilities include a five-year revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of 500 million, of which zero was outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The revolving credit facility also contains a sub-facility to be used for letters of credit, and as of September 30, 2024, there were 22 million letters of credit outstanding. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding 403 million in aggregate principal balance of 5.125 senior unsecured notes due in 2029, 650 million aggregate principal balance of 5.000 senior unsecured notes due in 2028 and 52 million in aggregate principal balance of 5.250 senior unsecured notes due in 2030.

Employee Benefit Plans In 2024, we expect to make contributions of 13 million to our international pension plans and 50 million to our postemployment plan. For additional information, refer to Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock As of September 30, 2024, the redemption value of the Series A Preferred Stock was approximately 276 million. Holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 5.5 per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, dividends are payable in cash or in-kind at the option of the Company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid cash dividends of 12 million. 
 
 Prior to the close of business on October 17, 2023, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible at the option of the holders at any time into shares of common stock at a conversion price of 30.00 per share, or a conversion rate of 33.333 shares of common stock per share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. As a result of the Spin-Off, the conversion rate of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was adjusted pursuant to its terms to 57.5601 shares of common stock per share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum number of common shares that could be required to be issued upon conversion of the outstanding shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was 15.9 million shares, which would represent approximately 10 of our outstanding common stock as of September 30, 2024, including the preferred shares on an as-converted basis. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents Held by Foreign Subsidiaries Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 137 million and 190 million, respectively. Under current tax laws and regulations, if cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the U.S. are distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, which could be significant. 
 
 Summary As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 795 million and our total debt was 1.1 billion, excluding deferred fees. As of September 30, 2024, our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was approximately 478 million. Our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions, the competitive environment in our industry, and is subject to the business and other risk factors described in Item 1A of Part I of the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (as applicable). If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or otherwise comply with the terms of our credit facilities, we may be required to seek additional financing alternatives. 
 
 We believe that we have sufficient liquidity based on our current cash position and existing financing to meet our expected pension, postemployment, and postretirement plan contributions, remediation payments related to environmental matters, debt servicing obligations, payments related to separation, transformation and restructuring initiatives, and in the long-term (i.e., beyond September 30, 2024) to meet our material cash requirements. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations 
 
 There have been no significant changes in our contractual and other commercial obligations as described in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations. These policies require highly subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates pertain to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, goodwill and intangible assets, pension, postretirement and postemployment benefits, environmental and legal contingencies, and income taxes, which are described in Item 7. of our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. It is our policy to manage our foreign exchange exposure and debt structure in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. In managing market risks, we employ derivatives according to documented policies and procedures, including foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 
 Since a portion of our operations and revenue occur outside the United States, and in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, our results can be significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have exposure to approximatel y 30 functional currencies and are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our sales, profits and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, we are not fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations and our reported results of operations could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To manage our exposures and mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on the operations of our foreign subsidiaries, we hedge our main transactional exposures through the use of foreign exchange forward and option contracts. If these contracts are designated as highly effective cash flow hedges, the gains or losses are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI ). We use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet exposures. For these derivatives we recognize gains and losses in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currency-denominated exposures. 
 
 We utilize non-exchange traded financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts, that we purchase exclusively from highly rated financial institutions. We record these contracts on our balance sheet at fair market value based upon market price quotations from the financial institutions. 
 
 For purposes of analyzing potential risk, we use sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts that market rate changes may have on the fair values of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the related gain or loss on the forecasted underlying transaction. A 10 appreciation in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the fair value of the hedge portfolio o f 4 million as of September 30, 2024. A 10 depreciation in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would have resulted in a corresponding increase in the fair value of the hedge portfolio of 3 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company expects that any increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in the underlying exposures being hedged. 
 
 The U.S. Dollar was stronger in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 based on comparable weighted averages for our functional currencies. This excludes the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, does not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our operating income. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Approximately 100 of our borrowings were on a fixed rate basis as of September 30, 2024. We are subject to interest rate risk principally in relation to variable-rate debt when we borrow from our Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings under this facility. 
 
 Historically, we were are subject to interest rate risk principally in relation to variable-rate debt and utilized interest rate swap contracts and interest rate cap agreements to add stability to interest expense and to manage exposure to interest rate movements. Payments and receipts related to interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 13, Derivatives and Hedging Instruments , for further information on our interest rate derivative contracts. 
 
 The increase in pre-tax interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in variable interest rates would be approximatel y 3 million . 
 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 
 We are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk on accounts receivable and financial instruments, such as hedging instruments and cash and cash equivalents. Credit risk includes the risk of nonperformance by counterparties. The maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the balance sheet. Exposure to credit risk is managed through credit approvals, credit limits, selecting major international financial institutions as counterparties to hedging transactions, and monitoring procedures. Our business often involves large transactions with customers for which we do not require collateral. If one or more of those customers were to default in its obligations under applicable contractual arrangements, we could be exposed to potentially significant losses. Moreover, a prolonged downturn in the global economy could have an adverse impact on the ability of our customers to pay their obligations on a timely basis. We believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any significant concentration of credit risk related to financial instruments. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company has established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)). The Company s management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers have concluded that, due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Newly Reported Material Weakness 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, management concluded the Company did not maintain effective controls over the review of manual journal entries related to foreign currency transactions. This material weakness resulted in immaterial errors impacting foreign currency exchange gains and losses in the second quarter of 2024 which were corrected in the third quarter of 2024 with no impact to the year-to-date results of operations. Additionally, this material weakness could result in material misstatements to the Company s consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Previously Reported Material Weaknesses 
 
 As previously reported in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, management identified the following material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023: 
 The Company did not design and maintain effective controls to prevent or timely detect unauthorized Automated Clearing House ACH disbursements; and 
 The Company did not design and maintain effective controls related to accounts receivable and accounts payable clearing accounts. Specifically, controls were not designed at a sufficient level of precision to timely reconcile and review the reasonableness and supportability of clearing account balances, including review of the nature and aging of the individual clearing account balances. 
 
 Although not materially impacting any previously reported periods, these material weaknesses resulted in errors in the Company s historical 2022 and 2021 financial statements and the revision of interim periods in 2023. Additionally, these material weaknesses could result in material misstatements to the Company s consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

 Status of Remediation Plans and Actions 
 
 The Company has implemented measures designed to ensure that the control deficiencies contributing to the previously reported material weaknesses described above are remediated. The design of these measures implemented has been determined to be effective. While we have implemented the remedial measures described below, we are still in the process of testing the applicable remediated controls. Accordingly, the material weaknesses have not yet been fully remediated as of September 30, 2024. The remediation actions implemented to date are as follows: 
 We have implemented a monitoring control to (i) perform at least an annual review of all Company bank account attributes and (ii) regularly review bank account activity for large and/or unusual transactions for all bank accounts permitting ACH direct debit transactions. 
 We have implemented a monthly control, with a sufficient level of precision, to timely reconcile and review the reasonableness and supportability of accounts receivable and accounts payable clearing account balances, including a review of the nature and aging of the individual clearing account balances. 
 We have implemented enhanced review controls specific to accounts receivable and accounts payable clearing accounts to ensure clear and precise escalation protocols for unreconciled items and the timely resolution of any matters escalated. 
 We have supplemented our existing training materials regarding fraud prevention and detection and incident escalation and resolution procedures. 
 
 As the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, the Company may decide to take additional measures or modify the remediation plans described above. The Company believes that these actions taken will remediate the previously reported material weaknesses described above in the fourth quarter of 2024; however, the material weaknesses are not considered remediated until those controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. The Company will continue to monitor the design and effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls and make any further changes management deems appropriate. 
 
 As it relates to the newly reported material weakness, the Company has developed a remediation plan, and has begun testing the effectiveness of the controls over the review of manual journal entries. The Company believes that this will remediate the newly reported material weakness. 
 
 To address the material weaknesses referenced above, management has performed additional analyses and procedures in order to prepare the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Based on these analyses and procedures, management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report present, in all material respects, the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than the remediation efforts described above, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II. Other Information 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The information required by this item is included in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly report and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. Other than the risk factors below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 The sale of our Digital Banking business may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits and may adversely affect our business. 
 
 We may not be able to achieve the full strategic, financial, operational, and other benefits that are expected to result from the Digital Banking Sale, including any expected optimization of operations, cost savings, and other business opportunities that may be facilitated by the Digital Banking Sale. In addition, such benefits may be delayed or less significant than anticipated. We cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the Digital Banking Sale will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved, or when they will be achieved, if at all. A failure to realize these and other anticipated benefits of the Digital Banking Sale or effectively utilize the proceeds from the Digital Banking Sale could have an adverse impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Our acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 The Company may be held liable to the Buyer of its Digital Banking Business if it fails to perform under its agreements with the Buyer, and the performance of such services may negatively affect the Company s business and operations . 
 
 In connection with the Digital Banking Sale, the Company and the Buyer entered into certain agreements, including a transition services agreement, providing for the performance of certain services by the Company for the benefit of the Buyer for a period of time after the Digital Banking Sale. If the Company does not satisfactorily perform its obligations under these agreements, it may be held liable for certain losses incurred by the Buyer. In addition, during the transition services period, the Company s management and employees may be required to divert their attention away from its business in order to provide services to the Buyer, which could adversely impact the Company s business. 
 
 Further, as a result of these transition services, our counterparty will have access to certain of the Company s information technology systems during the transition services period, as well as shared information technology infrastructure. Any disruption, degradation, destruction or manipulation of the Company s information technology systems as a result of such access, whether accidental or intentional, may cause cybersecurity, data protection or privacy incidents or failures, which could in turn interrupt or adversely impact our operations. 
 
 We may not realize the anticipated cost savings or other benefits related to the transition of our Hardware Business to an outsourced design and manufacturing (ODM) model on a timely basis or at all. 
 
 On August 6, 2024, we announced our entry into a commercial agreement with Ennoconn Corp. Ennoconn to transition our point-of-sale and self-checkout hardware businesses to an outsourced design and manufacturing model (the Hardware Business Transition ). While the Company and its counterparty are targeting January 1, 2025 to implement the Hardware Business Transition and the new hardware revenue model, this date is dependent upon various factors, including the migration of aspects of our international hardware business to Ennoconn that are not yet complete. As a result, there can be no guaranty that the Hardware Business Transition will be implemented successfully or within the anticipated timeline. The Company anticipates that, once the Hardware Business Transition is implemented, it will record revenue from point-of-sale and self-checkout hardware sales on a net basis, excluding the costs paid to Ennoconn. Prior to the implementation of the Hardware Business Transition, the substantial majority of the revenues from our hardware business are attributable to point-of-sale and self-checkout hardware. Under our new business model following the Hardware Business Transition, a substantial majority of the revenue related to the sale of hardware will no longer be recognized by the Company, and will instead be recognized by the 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 hardware provider. This will result in a substantial decrease to our hardware-related revenues and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 
 The Company also expects to reduce hardware-related costs in connection with the Hardware Business Transition. If the Company is unable to reduce costs in connection with the Hardware Business Transition or if the Hardware Business Transition has an adverse impact on the Company s hardware sales or customer relationships, this could have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition. 
 
 In addition, as a result of the Hardware Business Transition, our counterparty will design, manufacture, warrant, supply, and ship self-checkout and point-of sale hardware directly to the Company s customers. Third parties may fail to deliver on their commitments or otherwise breach obligations to our customers, which may in turn damage our reputation and relationship with our customers. As such, a failure of third parties to adequately serve our customers may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.

 Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 In March 2017, the Board approved a share repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization, that provided for the repurchase of up to 300 million of the Company s common stock (the Repurchase Program ). In July 2018, the Board authorized an incremental 200 million of share repurchases under the Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2024, the Repurchase Program had an existing aggregate remaining repurchase authority of 153 million. 
 
 The timing and amount of repurchases under the Repurchase Program will depend upon market conditions, and may be made from time to time in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase programs, issuer self-tender offers or otherwise. The repurchases will be made in compliance with applicable securities laws and may be discontinued at any time. 
 
 In October 2016, the Board approved a share repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization, for the repurchase of the Company s common stock to offset the dilutive effects of the Company s employee stock purchase plan, equity awards and in-kind dividends on the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Dilution Offset Program ). In November 2024, the Board terminated the Dilution Offset Program. 
 
 The Company s 2017 Stock Incentive Plan allows shares to be surrendered to the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of restricted stock units . The following table sets forth information with respect to our repurchases of shares of common stock (including shares surrendered to satisfy tax withholding) during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Period Total number of shares purchased (1) 
 Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs Approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs (in millions) (2)

 (1) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 196,098 shares were surrendered to the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of restricted stock units issued to employees under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan. With respect to these surrendered shares, the price paid per share is based on the fair value at the time of surrender. 
 (2) Represents amounts available for repurchases under the Repurchase Program. The Company s Dilution Offset Program was terminated in November 2024. Accordingly, historic accrued availability under the Dilution Offset Program of approximately 959 million prior to the program s termination has been omitted from the table. 
 
 The Company s ability to repurchase its common stock is subject to (i) certain restrictions under the terms of the Company s senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing its senior unsecured notes and (ii) the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors.
