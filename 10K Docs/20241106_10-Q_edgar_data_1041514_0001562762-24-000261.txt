redemptions of common stock, or 
adjustments to the 
 carrying value of the redeemable common stock during 
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Accordingly, 
the two-
 class method presented below does not include the impact of 
any redemption. The Company s redeemable common stock is described 
 in Note 14 to the Company s audited consolidated financial statements included in 
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for 
the year ended 
 June 30, 2024. 
 Basic (loss) earnings per share 
includes shares of restricted stock that 
meet the definition of a 
participating security because these 
 shares are eligible 
to receive non 
-forfeitable dividend 
equivalents at the 
same rate as 
common stock. 
Basic (loss) earnings 
per share 
 has been calculated using the two-class 
method and basic (loss) earnings per share 
for the three months ended September 
30, 2024 and 
 2023, 
reflects only undistributed earnings. The computation below of basic (loss) earnings per 
share excludes the net loss attributable 
 to shares of unvested 
restricted stock (participating 
non-vested restricted stock) 
from the numerator 
and excludes the dilutive 
impact 
 of these unvested shares of restricted stock from the denominator. 
 Diluted (loss) 
earnings 
per share 
has been 
calculated 
to give 
effect 
to the 
number 
of shares 
of additional 
common 
stock that 
 would have 
been outstanding 
if the 
potential dilutive 
instruments had 
been issued 
in each 
period. Stock 
options are 
included in 
the 
 calculation of diluted (loss) earnings per share utilizing the treasury 
stock method and are not considered to be 
participating securities, 
 as the 
stock options 
do not 
contain non-forfeitable 
dividend rights. 
The Company 
has excluded 
employee stock 
options to 
purchase 

and 

shares of common 
stock from 
the calculation 
of diluted 
loss per 
share during 
the three 
months ended 
September 
 30, 2024 and 2023, because the effect would be antidilutive. 
 The 
calculation 
of diluted 
(loss) earnings 
per

includes the 
dilutive 
effect 
of 
a portion 
of the

The segment 
information as 
reviewed by 
the chief operating 
decision maker 
does not include 
a measure of 
segment assets per 
 segment as all of 
the significant assets are 
used in the operations 
of all, rather than 
any one, of the segments. 
The Company does 
not 
 have dedicated assets 
assigned to a 
particular operating segment. 
Accordingly, 
it is not meaningful 
to attempt an 
arbitrary allocation 
 and segment asset allocation is therefore not presented.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year 
ended June 30, 2024, 
 and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and 
the accompanying notes included in this Form 10-Q. 
 U.S. securities laws

non-GAAP 
 measures 
and 
provide 
reconciliations 
to 
the 
most 
directly 
comparable 
GAAP 
measures. 
We 
discuss 
why 
we 
consider 
it 
useful 
to 
 present these non 
-GAAP measures and 
the material risks 
and limitations of 
these measures, as 
well as a 
reconciliation of these 
non-
 GAAP measures 
to the

performance 
or achievements 
to be 
materially 
different 
from 
any future 
results, levels

such as 
 may , 
 will , should 
 , could , 
 would , 
 expects , 
 plans , intends , anticipates , believes , estimates , predicts , potential or continue or the negative of such terms 
and other 
 comparable terminology. 
 Although we believe 
that the expectations 
reflected in the 
forward-looking statements are 
reasonable, we do 
not know whether 
 we can 
achieve positive 
future results, 
levels of 
activity, 
performance, or 
goals. Actual 
events or 
results may 
differ 
materially. 
We 
 undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-Q to conform those statements 
 to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by applicable 
law. 
 You 
should read this Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference herein and the documents we have filed as exhibits hereto 
 and thereto 
and which we 
have filed with 
the United States 
Securities and 
Exchange Commission SEC completely 
and with 
the 
 understanding that our 
actual future results, 
levels of activity, 
performance and achievements 
may be materially 
different from 
what 
 we expect. We 
qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary 
statements.

 of 145.5 million 
(ZAR 2.6 billion) was 
at the mid-point of 
our revenue guidance 
and compares to 136.1 
million (ZAR 2.5 
billion) 
 in 2024. 

 Operating 
loss 
of 
 0.05

 Core to 
our device

is the 
decision 
to focus 
on quality 
business and 
optimizing 
our existing 
fleet, 
 which is reflected in a healthy throughput growth and margin 
per device. 
 
 VAS 
and supplier payments throughput increased 38 to R9.9 billion. We have separately disclosed supplier payments 
 from traditional VAS 
as it is becoming a material contributor to our 
throughput and attracts a lower gross profit margin. 
 Supplier payments

important part 
of the micro

we are 
developing as 
part of 
our strategy 
to 
 provide a holistic offering to micro-merchants in informal markets.

 Capital Connect disbursed 
ZAR 166 million 
during Q1 2025, 
compared to ZAR 
173 million in 
the comparable period 
 last year, representing 
a 4 decrease, reflective of the deterioration 
in financial strength of our merchants compared 
to 
 a year ago. We 
have maintained our strict 
credit criteria during the high 
interest rate and inflationary 
cycle resulting in 
 less merchants qualifying for new or renewals of credit lines. 

With a 
more positive political 
environment, the suspension 
of load-shedding 
and hopefully the 
start of an 
interest rate 
 down cycle, 
we are 
more optimistic 
this business 
can resume 
a growth 
trend reflective 
in the 
8 increase 
in Capital 
 Connect disbursements 
this quarter compared to ZAR 154 million a quarter ago (quarter four fiscal 2024.) 

Capital Connect s 
lending proposition 
is an important 
component in 
enabling the merchants 
we serve 
to compete 
and 
 grow. Since inception, Capital Connect 
has distributed more 
than ZAR 3 
billion of funding 
to merchants and 
can provide 
 funding of up to ZAR 5 million in under 24 hours. Quick access to affordable and flexible opportunity capital is vital in 
 every stage of a merchant s lifecycle, 
enabling them to never miss an opportunity. 
 
 Kazang Pay Advance, our lending offering 
in the micro-merchant sector, was suspended 
in early fiscal 2024 following 
 the decision to discontinue the 
current product, especially in the 
high interest rate environment. We continued to explore 
 other options 
with respect 
to this 
offering 
with it 
now in 
live pilot 
phase. We 
are monitoring 
payment behavior 
on a 
 smaller loan book and applying stricter lending criteria before the official 
relaunch later in fiscal 2025. 

 Our cash management and digitalization
 solutions effectively puts the bank in approximately 4,480 
merchants stores.

 Our 
cash 
business 
remains 
a 
vital 
product 
in 
our 
merchant 
offering 
and 
is 
a 
key 
differentiator 
for 
us 
in 
the 
 digitalization of cash. We 
provide robust cash vaults in the SME sector (Cash Connect) and are building a presence 
 in the micro-merchant sector 
(Kazang Vaults), 
which enables our merchant 
customer base to significantly 
mitigate 
 their operational risks pertaining to cash management and security. 

 o
 Whilst there 
is trend 
towards digital 
payments, 
cash remains 
as the 
most significant 
portion 
of retail 
transactions 
 especially 
in 
informal 
markets. 
This 
business 
is 
primarily 
exposed 
to 
the 
mid-market 
SMEs, 
a 
sector 
which 
has 
 experienced challenges such as power outages, high price inflation and a slowdown in consumer spending, over the 
 past 24 months. This impacted 
the merchants we serve in 
this sector and resulted in 
increased bankruptcies and vault 
 upliftments which affected the net growth in the vault estate. 
 Consumer Division 

 In 
our 
Consumer 
Division 
we 
offer 
transactional 
accounts 
(banking), 
insurance, 
lending 
and 
payments 
solutions 
designed 
to 
 improve the lives 
of historically underserviced 
consumers and continue 
to deliver against 
our strategic focus 
areas underpinning our 
 growth 
strategy. 
Progress made 
on these 
levers: (i) 
growing 
active EasyPay 
Everywhere EPE 
account numbers; 
(ii) increasing 
 average revenue per user ARPU through cross-selling; (iii) cost 
optimization; and (iv) enhancing our product and service offering, 
 resulted in revenue and profitability growth in the Consumer Division in the 
first quarter of fiscal 2025.

 Driving customer acquisition 
 o
 Gross EPE account 
activations, continue to 
grow at the new 
levels for the permanent 
base, post our marketing 
and 
 distribution network enhancements 
in fiscal 2024. 
We 
achieved approximately 62,000 
gross account activations 
in 
 the quarter which was pleasing in a traditionally quiet 
quarter for us. This compares to a higher 
than usual activation 
 rate in quarter one fiscal 
2024 due to significant migration 
away from the South African 
Post Office in that 
quarter 
 driven 
by 
concerns 
around 
its 
going 
concern 
status 
and 
its 
failure 
to 
timeously 
distribute 
grants 
timeously. 
Net 
 activations of 
26,000 in 
the quarter 
was negatively 
impacted by 
the closure 
of the 
SASSA South African 
Social 
 Security Agency) 
 digital portal for switching. 

 o
 Our total active EPE transactional account base stood at approximately 1.5 million at the end of September 
2024, of 
 which 
approximately 
1.3 million 
(or approximately 
88 
are permanent 
grant recipients. 
The balance 
comprises 
 Social Relief of Distress SRD grant recipients, which was 
introduced during the COVID pandemic and 
extended 
 in calendar year 2023. 
 o
 Our priority 
is to grow 
our permanent 
grant recipient 
customers base, 
where we 
can build 
deeper relationships 
by 
 offering products such as insurance and lending. We 
do not offer the same breadth of service to the SRD grant base 
 due to the temporary nature of the grant.

 Progress on cross

 EasyPay Loans 

 o
 We 
originated 
approximately 286 
000 loans 
during the 
quarter, 
with our 
consumer loan 
book, before 
allowances 
 gross book ), increasing 34 to ZAR 564 million 
as of September 30, 2024, compared to ZAR 423 
million as of 
 September 30, 2023. 
 o
 We have not amended our credit scoring or other lending criteria, and the growth is reflective of the demand for our 
 tailored 
loan 
product 
for 
this 
market, 
growth 
in 
EPE 
bank 
account 
customer 
base 
and 
improved 
cross-selling 
 capabilities. 

 o
 The 
loan 
conversion 
rate continues 
to improve 
following 
the implementation 
of 
a number 
of targeted 
Consumer 
 lending campaigns and encouraging results from our digital channels. 

 o
 The 
portfolio

of 
approximately 
6 , 
calculated 
as 
the 
loans 
written 
off 
over 
the 
last

months 
as 
a 
 percentage of the total 
gross loan book at the 
end of the quarter, 
remained stable on an 
annualized basis, compared 
 to quarter one fiscal 2024. 
 EasyPay Insurance 

 o
 Our insurance product sales continue to grow and 
is a material contributor to the 
improvement in our overall ARPU. 
 We 
have 
been 
able 
to 
improve 
customer 
penetration 
to 
34 
of 
our 
active 
permanent 
grant 
account 
base 
as 
of 
 September 30, 2024, compared to 31 as of September 30, 2023. Approximately 49,000 new policies 
were written 
 in the quarter, compared to 
approximately 38,000 in the 
comparable period in fiscal 
2024. The total number 
of active 
 policies has grown 30 to approximately 466,000 policies as of September 30, 2024, compared to 359,000 policies 
 as of September 30, 2023. 
 o
 In April 2024 we launched a new benefit where existing policyholders and new clients could elect 
to cover up to six 
 of their 
dependent family 
members with 
cover ranging 
from ZAR 
5 000 to 
ZAR 30 000. 
Since the 
launch of 
this 
 benefit more than 25 00 clients have elected to cover their dependent family 
members. 
 ARPU 

 o
 ARPU for our permanent client 
base has increased to 
approximately ZAR 91 for the 
first quarter of fiscal 
2025, from 
 approximately ZAR 83 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 

 Adumo Payouts 
 o
 On 1 October 
the Adumo Payouts 
business officially became part 
of the Consumer 
Division. We are looking forward 
 to 
working 
with 
them 
as 
we 
build 
out 
the 
Consumer 
offering 
beyond 
the 
grant 
recipient 
space. 
The 
Adumo 
 contribution will be reflected in our quarter two fiscal 2025 results. 

 Board and Leadership Changes in quarter one fiscal 2025 
 Leadership changes 

 On October, 
1 2024 Dan 
Smith was appointed 
as Group Chief 
Financial Officer 
taking over these 
responsibilities from 
Naeem 
 Kola, 
who 
transitioned 
to 
Group 
Chief 
Operating 
Officer. 
Mr. 
Smith 
was also 
appointed 
to 
the 
Board. 
As Lesaka 
scales, 
we 
will 
 continue to augment our executive capability to accommodate the growing size of the business and deliver on the opportunity in front 
 of us. 
 Paul 
Kent, 
the 
CEO 
of 
Adumo, 
joined 
the 
Lesaka 
executive 
team 
on 
completion 
of 
the 
Adumo 
transaction 
to 
oversee 
the 
 Merchant pillar within Lesaka s Merchant 
Division. 
 Board changes

Similarly, on completion of the Adumo acquisition Dean Sparrow, Group CEO of Crossfin 
Technology Holdings (RF) (Pty) Ltd, 
 was appointed to the Board as an independent non-executive director 
and joined Lesaka s Capital Allocation Committee. 

 Chris Meyer and Monde Nkosi, non-executive directors, stepped 
down as directors of the Board in October 2024. 

40 
 Acquisition of Adumo 

 On October 
1, 2024, 
we announced 
the closing 
of the 
Adumo transaction 
which enhances 
our platform, 
adding customers 
and 
 products, as well as 
scale. The completion 
of this transaction 
marks the beginning 
of a new chapter 
in the Lesaka story. 
Adumo will 
 be included in our results for the full second quarter of fiscal 2025. 

 Going forward Lesaka will be run in four distinct pillars 

 The Adumo 
transaction is the 
catalyst to approach 
the market with 
a more customer 
-centric operating 
model. From 
a financial 
 reporting standpoint, 
we will continue 
to maintain the 
Consumer Division 
and Merchant Division 
split however 
we will present 
our 
 KPIs and performance with a more granular breakdown. 
 Our Consumer segment 
will remain substantially 
the same however 
the perimeter will 
be expanded to 
include the Adumo 
Payouts 
 business. 

 In our 
Merchant segment, 
the Adumo transaction 
provides the 
opportunity to 
segment the 
business into 
three component 
parts 
 organized around distinct customers. Micro-Merchant, 
Merchant and Enterprise. 

 Micro-merchants are 
typically sole 
proprietors, often 
operating in 
the informal 
economy. 
We 
address these 
customers through 
 the 
Kazang 
and 
Touchsides 
brands. 
In 
South 
Africa 
the 
focus 
will 
be 
to 
augment 
the 
product 
offering 
and 
cross-sell 
to 
existing 
 customers 
so that 
we can 
materially improve 
the unit 
economics, 
as we 
have been 
doing. Outside 
of South 
Africa, in 
neighboring 
 geographies, 
there are 
a substantial 
number of 
sole traders 
who have 
very limited 
offerings available 
to them 
to empower 
them on 
 their digital journey. 
Here we have an opportunity again to expand our total addressable market through wallet growth. 

 The 
Merchant 
pillar 
is 
made 
up 
of 
the 
existing 
Connect 
operations, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
bulk 
of 
Adumo, 
specifically 
its 
merchant 
 acquiring 
and 
processing 
business 
and 
its 
GAAP 
hospitality 
platform. 
The 
Connect 
business 
has 
cash 
and 
credit 
as 
key 
product 
 offerings, the 
Adumo business has 
merchant acquiring and 
software at point 
of sale. Combined 
the Lesaka offering 
will be amongst 
 most comprehensive in the market in meeting the needs of small and medium size businesses 
in the region. 
 Our Enterprise 
segment will focus 
on large 
corporates, mobile network 
operators, banks, 
governments and 
municipalities. Our 
 solutions include a 
new payment switch, Prism 
Switch, our Point 
Of Sale hardware 
business branded Prism 
POS (previously known 
 as NUETS), our bill payments platform EasyPay, as well as a third party vending and security business. As well as serving third party 
 corporates it will also service some of the technology needs of our other pillars, Consumer, 
Micro-Merchant and Merchant.

 Critical Accounting Policies
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated 
financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with U.S. 
GAAP, 
which requires 
 management 
to 
make 
estimates 
and 
assumptions 
about 
future 
events 
that 
affect 
the 
reported 
amount 
of 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
and 
 disclosure 
of 
contingent 
assets and 
liabilities. 
As future 
events 
and 
their 
effects 
cannot be 
determined 
with 
absolute 
certainty, 
the 
 determination 
of 
estimates 
requires 
management s 
judgment 
based 
on 
a 
variety 
of 
assumptions 
and 
other 
determinants 
such 
as 
 historical experience, current and expected market conditions and certain scientific evaluation techniques. Critical accounting policies 
 are those 
that reflect 
significant judgments 
or uncertainties 
and may 
potentially result 
in materially 
different 
results under 
different 
 assumptions 
and 
conditions. 
We 
have 
identified 
the 
following 
critical 
accounting 
policies that 
are 
described 
in 
more 
detail 
in 
our 
 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024: 

Business Combinations and the Recoverability of Goodwill; 
 
 Intangible Assets Acquired Through Acquisitions; 
 
 Revenue recognition principal versus agent considerations; 
 
 Valuation 
of investment in Cell C; 
 
 Recoverability of equity securities and equity-accounted investments; 
 
 Deferred Taxation; 
 
 Stock-based Compensation; 
 
 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable; 
and 
 
 Lending.

 Translation exchange 
rates for financial reporting purposes
 We are required 
to translate our results of operations from ZAR to U.S. dollars on a monthly 
basis. Thus, the average rates used 
 to translate 
this data 
for the 
three months 
ended September 
30, 2024 
and 2023, 
vary slightly 
from the 
averages shown 
in the 
table 
 above. 
Except 
as 
described 
below, 
the 
translation 
rates 
we 
use 
in 
presenting 
our 
results 
of 
operations 
are 
the 
rates 
shown 
in 
the 
 following table:

 We have 
translated the results of operations and 
operating segment information for the 
three months ended September 30, 
2024 
 and 2023, 
provided in 
the tables below 
using the actual 
average exchange 
rates per month 
(i.e. for 
each of 
July 2024, 
August 2024, 
 and September 2024 for the 
first quarter of fiscal 
2025) between the USD and 
ZAR in order to reduce 
the reconciliation of information 
 presented to our chief 
operating decision maker. 
The impact of using this method 
compared with the average 
rate for the quarter and 
 year to date 
is not significant, 
however, it 
does result in 
minor differences. 
We 
believe that presentation 
using the average 
exchange 
 rates 
per 
month 
compared 
with 
the 
average 
exchange 
rate 
per 
quarter 
and 
year 
to 
date 
improves 
the 
accuracy 
of 
the 
information 
 presented 
in 
our 
external 
financial 
reporting 
and 
leads 
to 
fewer 
differences 
between 
our 
external 
reporting 
measures 
which 
are 
 supplementally presented in ZAR, and our internal management information, 
which is also presented in ZAR. 
 Results of Operations
 The discussion 
of our 
consolidated overall 
results of 
operations is 
based on 
amounts as 
reflected 
in our 
unaudited condensed 
 consolidated financial 
statements which 
are prepared 
in accordance 
with U.S. 
GAAP. 
We 
analyze our 
results of 
operations both 
in 
 U.S. dollars, as presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated 
financial statements, and supplementally in ZAR, because ZAR is 
 the functional 
currency of 
the entities 
which contribute 
the majority 
of our 
results and 
is the 
currency in 
which the 
majority of 
our 
 transactions 
are 
initially 
incurred 
and 
measured. 
Presentation 
of our 
reported 
results 
in ZAR 
is a 
non-GAAP 
measure. 
Due 
to 
the 
 significant impact of currency 
fluctuations between the U.S. 
dollar and ZAR on 
our reported results and because 
we use the U.S. 
dollar 
 as our reporting 
currency, 
we believe that 
the supplemental presentation 
of our results 
of operations in 
ZAR is useful 
to investors to 
 understand the changes in the underlying trends of our business.

In addition, 
corporate activities

in Eliminations. 

 First quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to first quarter 
of fiscal 2024 
 The following factors had a significant impact on 
our results of operations during the first 
quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared with 
 the same period in the prior year: 
 
 Higher 
revenue: 
 Our 
revenues 
increased 
3 
in 
ZAR, 
primarily 
due 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
value-added 
services 
activity 
and 
 processing fees in Merchant, 
as well as higher transaction, insurance and lending revenues in Consumer, which was partially 
 offset by fewer low margin prepaid airtime sales;
 
 Operating 
income 
improvement, 
before 
transaction 
costs: 
 Operating 
income, 
before 
Adumo-related 
transaction 
costs, 
 increased 
due to an increase trading activity as noted above; 

Lower net interest 
charge:
 
Net interest 
charge decreased 
to 4.4 million 
(ZAR 79.8 million) 
from 4.5 million 
(ZAR 83.1 
 million) primarily due to lower interest rates on our borrowings, which was partially 
offset by higher over borrowings; and

 Revenue increased by 
 9.5 million (ZAR 
78.0 million), or 
6.9 (in ZAR, 3.1), primarily due 
to an increase in 
the volume of 
 value-added 
services 
provided 
(prepaid 
airtime 
and 
gaming), 
high 
transactions 
volumes 
from 
our 
vault 
and 
cash 
management 
 operations 
resulting 
in higher 
processing 
fees, an 
increase 
in certain 
issuing fee 
base prices 
and 
transaction 
activity in 
our 
issuing 
 business, and an 
increase in insurance 
premiums collected and 
lending revenues following 
higher loan 
originations, which was 
partially 
 offset 
by fewer 
low margin 
prepaid 
airtime sales. 
Refer to 
discussion 
above 
at Recent 
Developments 
for a 
description 
of key 
 trends impacting our revenue this quarter. 

 Cost of 
goods sold, 
IT processing, 
servicing and 
support increased 
by 3.4 
million (or 
3.2 and, 
in ZAR, decreased 
by ZAR 
 10.8 million 
(or 0.5 ), 
primarily the 
decrease in 
low margin 
prepaid airtime 
sales, which 
was partially 
by higher 
insurance-related 
 claims and third-party transaction fees. 
 Selling, 
general 
and 
administration 
expenses 
increased 
by 
 4.2 
million 
(ZAR 
59.8 
million), 
or 
18.7 
(in 
ZAR 
14.2 ). 
The 
 increase was 
primarily due 
to higher 
employee-related expenses 
(including annual 
bonuses and 
annual salary 
increases) and 
higher 
 stock-based 
compensation 
charges; 
higher 
consulting, 
legal 
and 
travel 
expenses, 
and 
the 
year-over-year 
impact 
of 
inflationary 
 increases on certain expenses. 

45 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 0.4 million (ZAR 3.5 million), or 7.2 
(3.2 ). The increase was due to an 
 increase in depreciation expense related to additional POS devices deployed 
. 
 Transaction costs related to Adumo acquisition 
includes fees paid to 
external service providers associated 
with legal and advisory 
 services procured to close the transaction on October 1, 2024. 
 Our operating (loss) income margin 
for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 
was (0.0) and 0.2 , respectively. 
We discuss 
 the components of operating loss margin under Results of operations 
by operating segment. 

 We did not record any changes in the fair value of equity interests in MobiKwik and Cell C 
during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 
 or 2024, respectively. We 
continue to carry our investment in Cell 
C at 0 (zero). Refer to Note 
4 for the methodology and inputs used 
 in the fair value calculation for Cell C. 
 Interest 
on surplus 
cash increased 
to 0.6 
million 
(ZAR 10.5 
million) 
from 0.4 
million (ZAR 
8.4 
million), 
primarily 
due 
to 
 higher overall average cash balances on deposit during the first quarter 
of fiscal 2025 compared with 2024. 
 Interest expense increased to 5.0 
million from 4.9 million 
and, in ZAR, decreased 
to ZAR 90.3 million 
from ZAR 91.4 million. 
 In ZAR, the decrease was primarily as a result of lower interest expense incurred 
on certain of our borrowing for which we were able 
 to negotiate lower 
rates of interest towards 
the end of 
calendar 2024, which 
was partially offset 
by higher overall 
borrowings during 
 the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with comparable period 
in the prior quarter. 
 Fiscal 2025 
tax expense 
was 0.1 
million (ZAR 
1.4 million) 
compared to 
 0.3 million 
(ZAR 4.8 
million) in 
fiscal 2024. 
Our 
 effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 was impacted 
by the tax expense recorded by our profitable South 
African operations, a deferred tax 
 benefit related to acquisition-related 
intangible asset amortization, non-deductible 
expenses (in transaction-related expenses), 
the on-
 going losses incurred by 
certain of our 
South African businesses 
and the associated 
valuation allowances created related to 
the deferred 
 tax assets recognized regarding net operating losses incurred by these entities.

 (3) Group Adjusted EBITDA 
is a non-GAAP measure, refer 
to reconciliation below at 
 Results of Operations Use of 
Non-
 GAAP Measures . 
 Merchant
 Segment revenue 
primarily increased 
due to 
a higher 
volume of 
value-added services 
provided (prepaid 
airtime and 
gaming), 
 and high transactions volumes from 
our vault and cash 
management operations resulting in higher 
processing fees, which was 
partially 
 offset by fewer low margin prepaid airtime sales. In ZAR, the modest decrease in Segment Adjusted EBITDA is primarily due higher 
 operating expenses incurred, especially employment-related expenditures, to expand 
our offering, which was partially offset by 
higher 
 gross 
margin 
(calculated 
as 
revenue 
less 
cost 
of 
goods 
sold, 
IT 
processing, 
servicing 
and 
support). 
Connect 
records 
a 
significant 
 proportion 
of its 
airtime sales 
in revenue 
(see further 
below) and 
cost of 
sales, while 
only 
earning 
a relatively 
small margin. 
This 
 significantly depresses 
the Segment 
Adjusted EBITDA 
margins 
shown by 
the business. 
During the 
first quarter 
of fiscal 
2025, 
we 
 experience a shift 
in the mix 
between the 
sale of pinned 
prepaid airtime 
and distribution of 
pinless prepaid 
airtime, with the 
volume 
 of pinned airtime sales decreasing, which results in a lower revenue 
and related cost of sales, and an overall improved margin. 

47 
 Our Segment 
Adjusted EBITDA margin 
(calculated as Segment 
Adjusted EBITDA 
divided by revenue) 
for the first 
quarter of 
 fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 6.3 and 6.4 , respectively. 
 Prepaid airtime sales 
 In South Africa and other countries, mobile network operators MNOs offer prepaid or contract (or postpaid) services to their 
 customers to telephony 
services using a 
mobile telephony network 
or networks. MNOs 
also offer similar 
products (prepaid or 
postpaid) 
 for mobile data 
which uses other 
wireless network protocols 
such as wireless 
fidelity wifi ). 
We 
use the term 
 prepaid airtime 
to 
 include both of these prepaid products. 

 Generally speaking, the difference between the two 
models is that prepaid is 
paid for upfront by the 
customer and contract is paid 
 in arrears. MNOs sell prepaid products directly to their customers and also indirectly 
to their customers through distribution channels 
 (which include wholesalers, retailers and other parties, including ourselves). 
 We sell 
a variety of products through our 
distribution channels, including prepaid airtime, 
prepaid electricity, 
gaming vouchers. 
 We refer to these 
products collectively as VAS. 
 In order to load airtime onto 
a mobile device an MNOs customer 
requires a prepaid airtime voucher. A unique code is 
assigned 
 to each prepaid 
airtime voucher and 
is required to 
activate the prepaid 
airtime on a 
mobile device. Like 
certain tangible goods, 
once 
 sold, our 
customers cannot 
return prepaid 
airtime vouchers 
to us (except 
of course 
if there is 
a defect 
in the 
service provided 
by us, 
 which rarely occurs). 
 We 
can either 
purchase an 
agreed quantity 
of prepaid 
airtime vouchers 
upfront directly 
from 
wholesalers or 
other parties 
(so 
 called Pinned airtime - these electronic vouchers are stored 
on a server owned and maintained by us and we treat 
these vouchers as 
 inventory) 
or 
we 
can 
 interface 
directly 
into 
a 
wholesaler 
and 
deliver 
the 
airtime 
voucher 
directly 
to 
our 
customers 
(typically 
 merchants) as the airtime is sold by the merchant to MNOs customers (so called Pinless airtime). 

 Consumer
 Segment 
revenue 
increased 
primarily 
due 
to higher 
transaction 
fees 
generated 
from 
the higher 
EPE 
account holders 
base, 
an 
 increase in certain 
issuing fee base 
prices and transaction 
activity in our 
issuing business, 
insurance premiums collected 
and lending 
 revenues following 
an increase 
in loan 
originations. 
This increase 
in revenue 
has translated 
into improved 
profitability, 
which was 
 partially offset 
by higher 
insurance-related 
claims and 
interest expenses 
(of approximately 
ZAR 15.0 
million) incurred 
to fund 
our 
 lending 
book 
and 
the 
year-over-year 
impact 
of 
inflationary 
increases 
on 
certain 
expenses. 
 We 
 intend 
to 
obtain 
a 
separate 
lending 
 facility to 
fund a 
portion of 
our lending 
during fiscal 
2025. 
 We 
 expected to 
have this facility 
in place 
on July 1, 
2024, however, 
we 
 have been unable 
to finalize terms as 
the separate lending 
facility will form part 
of a broader financing 
package. Therefore, we 
have 
 included an intercompany interest expense in our Consumer Segment Adjusted 
EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Our Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the 
first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 20.9 
and 13.6 , respectively. 
 Group costs
 Our group 
costs primarily 
include employee 
related costs 
in relation 
to employees 
specifically hired 
for group 
roles and 
costs 
 related 
directly 
to 
managing 
the 
US-listed 
entity; 
expenditures 
related 
to 
compliance 
with 
the 
Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act 
of 
2002; 
non-
 employee directors fees; legal fees; group and US-listed related audit 
fees; and directors and officers insurance premiums. 
 Our group costs for fiscal 
2025 increased compared with the prior 
period due to higher employee 
costs resulting from an increase 
 in the number of 
individuals allocated to group 
costs and base salary 
adjustments, higher bonus 
expense, travel, consulting and 
legal 
 fees.

 Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
 U.S. securities laws 
require that when 
we publish any 
non-GAAP measures, we 
disclose the reason 
for using these 
non-GAAP 
 measures and provide reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The presentation of Group Adjusted EBITDA 
 is 
a 
non-GAAP 
measure. 
We 
provide 
this 
non-GAAP 
measure 
to 
enhance 
our 
evaluation 
and 
understanding 
of 
our 
financial 
 performance 
and 
trends. 
We 
believe 
that 
this 
measure 
is 
helpful 
to 
users 
of 
our 
financial 
information 
understand 
key 
operating 
 performance and 
trends in our 
business because 
it excludes certain 
non-cash expenses 
(including depreciation 
and amortization 
and 
 stock-based compensation charges) and income 
and expenses that we consider once-off in nature. 
 Non-GAAP Measures
 Group 
Adjusted 
EBITDA 
is 
earnings

of equity-accounted investments, gain related to 
fair value adjustments to currency 
 options), (earnings)

stock-based compensation 
charges and 
once-off

 Once-off items are non-recurring in nature, however, certain 
items may be reported in 
multiple quarters. For instance, transaction 
 costs include costs incurred related to acquisitions and 
transactions consummated or ultimately not pursued. The transactions can span 
 multiple 
quarters, 
for 
instance 
in 
fiscal 
2025 
we 
incurred 
significant 
transaction 
costs 
related 
to 
the 
acquisition 
of 
Adumo 
over 
a 
 number of quarters, and the transactions are generally non-recurring. 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources
 As of September 30, 2024, our 
cash and cash equivalents were 49.7 
million and comprised of U.S. dollar-denominated balances 
 of 2.0 million, 
ZAR-denominated balances of 
ZAR 791.0 million 46.0 million), and 
other currency deposits, 
primarily Botswana 
 pula, of 1.7 
million, all amounts 
translated at exchange 
rates applicable as of 
September 30, 2024. 
The decrease in 
our unrestricted 
 cash balances from June 30, 2024, was 
primarily due to the utilization of cash 
reserves to fund certain scheduled and 
other repayments 
 of our 
borrowings, 
purchase ATMs 
and vaults, 
pay annual 
bonuses, pay 
for expenses 
included 
in our 
group costs, 
and to 
make an 
 investment in 
working capital, 
which was partially 
offset by 
positive contribution 
from our 
Merchant and 
Consumer operations 
and 
 utilization. 
 We generally 
invest any surplus cash held by 
our South African operations in overnight 
call accounts that we maintain at 
South 
 African banking institutions, 
and any surplus 
cash held by 
our non-South African 
companies in 
U.S. dollar-denominated money market 
 accounts. 
 Historically, 
we have financed 
most of our 
operations, research and 
development, working capital, 
and capital expenditures, 
as 
 well 
as 
acquisitions 
and 
strategic 
investments, 
through 
internally 
generated 
cash 
and 
our 
financing 
facilities. 
When 
considering 
 whether to borrow under our financing 
facilities, we consider the cost 
of capital, cost of financing, opportunity cost 
of utilizing surplus 
 cash and 
availability of 
tax efficient 
structures to 
moderate financing 
costs. For 
instance, in 
fiscal 2022, 
we obtained 
loan facilities 
 from RMB 
to fund 
a portion 
of our 
acquisition of 
Connect. Following 
the acquisition 
of Connect, 
we now 
utilize a 
combination of 
 short 
and 
long-term 
facilities to 
fund our 
operating 
activities and 
a long-term 
asset-backed 
facility to 
fund 
the acquisition 
of POS 
 devices 
and 
vaults.

 Long-term borrowings 
 We 
have 
aggregate 
long-term 
borrowing 
outstanding 
of 
ZAR 
2.6 
billion 148.5 
million 
translated 
at 
exchange 
rates 
as 
of 
 September 30, 2024) 
as described in Note 
8. These borrowings 
include outstanding long-term 
borrowings obtained by Lesaka 
SA of 
 ZAR 1.0 billion, 
including accrued 
interest, which 
was used to 
partially fund 
the acquisition of 
Connect. The Lesaka 
SA borrowing 
 arrangements were amended in March 2023 to 
include a ZAR 200 million revolving 
credit facility. We have settled all drawn amounts 
 in full as 
of September 30, 
2024, with 
the full 
balance available for 
utilization in the 
future. In 
contemplation of the 
Connect transaction, 
 Connect obtained total facilities 
of ZAR 1.3 billion, 
which were utilized to 
repay its existing borrowings, 
to fund a 
portion of its capital 
 expenditures and 
to settle obligations 
under the 
transaction documents, 
and which 
has subsequently 
been upsized for 
its operational 
 requirements and has 
an outstanding balance 
as of September 30, 
2024, of ZAR 1.2 
billion, We 
also have a revolving 
credit facility, 
 of ZAR 300.0 million which is utilized to fund a portion of our merchant finance 
loans receivable book. 
 On September 30, 2024, we obtained 
a ZAR 665.0 million funding facility from 
RMB which has been used on October 1, 
2024 
 to (i) settle an amount of ZAR 232.2 million due to the 
Adumo sellers; (ii) pay ZAR 207.2 million to acquire 2,601,410 shares of 
our 
 common stock from 
one of the Adumo 
sellers indirect shareholders; 
(iii) pay ZAR 147.5 
million notified by 
Investec Bank Limited 
 to Adumo and us as 
a result of the acquisition, 
(iv) pay an origination fee 
of ZAR 7.6 million to 
RMB and (v) pay ZAR 
70.0 million 
 of transaction-related expenses. 
 Restricted cash 
 As of 
September 30, 2024, 
we had 
credit facilities 
with RMB in 
order to access 
cash to 
fund our ATMs in South 
Africa. Utilization 
 of this facility is included in our cash, cash equivalents 
and restricted cash presented in our consolidated statement 
of cash flows. We 
 did not 
utilize the 
facility at 
the end 
of September 
2024. Any 
cash drawn 
under the 
facility may 
only be 
used to 
fund ATMs 
and is 
 considered restricted as to use and therefore is classified as restricted cash on 
our consolidated balance sheet. 
 We have 
also entered into cession and pledge 
agreements with Nedbank related to 
our Nedbank indirect credit facilities 
and we 
 have ceded and pledged 
certain bank accounts to 
Nedbank. The funds included 
in these bank accounts 
are restricted as they 
may not 
 be withdrawn without the express 
permission of Nedbank. Our cash, 
cash equivalents and restricted 
cash presented in our consolidated 
 statement of cash flows as of September 30, 2024, includes restricted cash of 
 0.1 million that has been ceded and pledged. 

51 
 Arrangement with African Bank to fund our ATMs 
 In 
September 
2024, 
we 
entered into 
an 
arrangement 
with African 
Bank Limited African 
Bank 
and 
certain 
cash-in-transit 
 service providers 
to fund 
our ATMs. 
Under this 
arrangement, African 
Bank will 
use its 
cash resources 
to fund 
our ATMs 
and it 
is 
 specifically recorded that the cash in our ATMs are African Bank s property. 
Therefore, 
as we have not utilized a facility to obtain the 
 cash, and do not own or control the cash for an extended period 
of time, we do not record cash or cash equivalents and borrowings 
in 
 our 
consolidated statement 
of financial 
position. 
Cash withdrawn 
from our 
ATMs 
by our 
EPE customers 
and other 
consumers are 
 settled through the interbank settlement 
system from the ATM 
users bank account to African 
Bank s bank 
accounts. We 
pay African 
 Bank a 
monthly fee 
for the 
service provided 
which is calculated 
based on 
the cumulative 
daily outstanding 
balance of 
cash utilized 
 multiplied by the South African prime interest rate 
less 1 . We are 
exposed to the risk of cash lost while it is in our 
ATMs 
(i.e. from 
 theft) and are required to repay African Bank for any shortages. 
 Cash flows from operating activities 
 First quarter 
 Net cash 
used operating 
activities during 
the first 
quarter of 
fiscal 2025 
was 4.1 
million (ZAR 
73.3 million) 
compared to 
net 
 cash provided by operating activities 
of 3.4 million (ZAR 63.1 
million) during the first quarter 
of fiscal 2024. Excluding the 
impact 
 of income taxes, our cash used in operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 includes cash utilized for the settlement of 
 working 
capital 
movements 
within 
our 
merchant 
business 
related 
to 
quarter-end 
transaction 
processing 
activities 
and 
which 
were 
 settled in the following week (our fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2024 closed on a Sunday), and the 
net growth in our consumer and merchant 
 finance 
loans 
receivable 
books, 
which 
was 
partially 
offset 
by 
was 
positively 
impacted 
by 
the 
contribution 
from 
Merchant 
and 
 Consumer businesses. 
 We didn t pay 
any significant taxes during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we paid second 
 provisional South 
African tax payments 
of - million 
(ZAR - million) 
related to certain 
Connect entities 2024

had not 
 yet been aligned with ours.

(ZAR 52.6 
 million), primarily due to the acquisition of vaults. 

52 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 First quarter 
 During the 
first quarter of 
fiscal 2025, we 
utilized 23.9 
million from 
our South African 
overdraft facilities 
to fund our 
ATMs 
 and our cash management business through Connect, and repaid 
 31.0 million of those facilities. We utilized 0.8 million of our long-
 term borrowings to fund 
the acquisition of certain 
capital expenditures and for 
working capital requirements. 
We repaid 
 5.5 million 
 of 
long-term 
borrowings 
in 
accordance 
with 
our 
repayment 
schedule 
as 
well 
as 
to 
settle 
a 
portion 
of 
our 
revolving 
credit 
facility 
 utilized. 
 During the 
first quarter of 
fiscal 2024, 
we utilized 59.6 
million from 
our South African 
overdraft facilities 
to fund our 
ATMs 
 and 
our 
cash 
management 
business through 
Connect, 
and 
repaid 
 62.8 
million 
of 
those facilities. 
We 
utilized 
approximately 
 2.5 
 million of our long-term borrowings 
to fund the acquisition of 
certain capital expenditures and 
for working capital requirements. 
We 
 repaid approximately 
 2.6 million of 
long-term borrowings in 
accordance with our 
repayment schedule as 
well as to 
settle a portion 
 of our revolving credit facility utilized. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 We have no off 
-balance sheet arrangements. 

 Capital Expenditures
 We 
expect capital 
spending for the 
second quarter of 
fiscal 2025 
to primarily include 
spending for acquisition 
of POS devices, 
 vaults, 
computer software, computer and office equipment, as well as for 
our ATM infrastructure and branch network in South Africa. 
 Our capital expenditures for 
the first quarter of fiscal 
2025 
and 2024 are discussed under 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash 
 flows from investing activities. All 
of our capital expenditures for 
the past three fiscal 
years were funded through internally 
generated 
 funds, or, 
following the 
Connect acquisition, 
our asset-backed 
borrowing arrangement. 
We 
had outstanding 
capital commitments 
as 
 of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
of 
 0.3 
million. 
We 
expect 
to 
fund 
these 
expenditures 
through 
internally 
generated 
funds 
and 
available 
 facilities.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About 
Market Risk 
 In addition to the tables below, see 
Note 4 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for 
a discussion of 
 market risk. 
 We 
have 
short and 
long-term borrowings 
in South 
Africa which 
attract interest 
at rates 
that fluctuate 
based on 
changes in 
the 
 South African prime 
and 3-month JIBAR 
interest rates. The 
following table illustrates 
the effect on 
our annual expected 
interest charge, 
 translated at exchange rates 
applicable as of September 
30, 2024, as a 
result of changes in 
the South African 
prime and 3-month JIBAR 
 interest rates, using 
our outstanding 
short and long-term 
borrowings as of 
September 30, 2024. 
The effect 
of a hypothetical 
1 (i.e. 
 100 basis points) 
increase and a 1 
decrease in the 
interest rates applicable 
to the borrowings 
as of September 
30, 2024, are shown. 
 The selected 1 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered 
the best- or worst-case scenarios.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Under 
the 
supervision 
and 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
our 
management, 
including 
our 
executive 
chairman 
and 
our 
group 
chief 
 financial officer, we conducted 
an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined 
under Rule 13a-15(e) 
 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of 
September 30, 2024. 
 We previously identified and disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended June 30, 2024, 
 material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
related to: (1) information technology general controls ITGCs ), 
 specifically 
insufficient 
risk 
assessment, 
design 
and 
implementation, 
monitoring 
activities 
and 
training 
of 
individuals 
to 
operate 
 controls 
in the 
areas of 
user access 
and 
program-change 
management 
for 
certain 
information 
technology 
systems 
that support 
our 
 financial reporting processes and (2) insufficient design and implementation of controls and associated policies 
and procedures in our 
 annual goodwill impairment assessment. A material weakness is a deficiency, 
or combination of deficiencies, in internal control 
over 
 financial reporting such 
that there 
is a 
reasonable possibility that 
a material misstatement 
of our annual 
or interim 
consolidated financial 
 statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 As a result 
of insufficient time to 
design and implement procedures 
to remediate the 
material weaknesses discussed in 
our Annual 
 Report on Form 
10-K for 
our fiscal 
year ended June 
30, 2024 (as 
described above), the 
executive chairman and 
the group chief 
financial 
 officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were 
not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Notwithstanding 
the 
previously 
identified 
material 
weaknesses, 
management 
believes 
the 
condensed 
consolidated 
financial 
 statements included 
in this Quarterly 
Report on 
Form 10-Q fairly 
present, in 
all material respects, 
our financial 
condition, results 
of 
 operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with 
GAAP. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 We have commenced 
with the design and implementation of the remediation plan during the three months ended 
September 30, 
 2024 which includes: 
 -
 the 
review 
of 
ITGCs 
and 
implementation 
of 
changes 
to 
certain 
controls 
to 
address 
the 
issues 
related 
to 
the 
material 
 weaknesses identified above; and 

 -
 the review and implementation of changes to the design of the controls related 
to the goodwill impairment assessment. 
 The remediation plan 
may be adjusted 
as is appropriate, 
as we continue 
to evaluate and 
enhance our internal 
control over financial 
 reporting. Other than the 
design and implementation of 
the remediation plan, there 
have not been any changes 
in our internal control 
 over financial reporting during 
the fiscal quarter ended 
September 30, 2024, that have 
materially affected, or are 
reasonably likely to 
 materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 See Item 
1A RISK 
FACTORS 
in Part 
I of 
our Annual 
Report on 
Form 10-K 
for the 
fiscal year 
ended June 
30, 2024, 
for a 
 discussion 
of 
risk 
factors 
relating 
to 
(i) 
our 
business, 
(ii) 
operating 
in 
South 
Africa 
and 
other 
foreign 
markets, 
(iii) government 
 regulation, and (iv) our common stock. Except 
as set forth below, there have been no material 
changes from the risk factors previously 
 disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 
2024. 
 We may not be able 
to successfully integrate Adumo s 
operations with our business. 
 On October 1, 2024, we announced the closing of our ZAR 1.67 billion 96.2 million) investment to acquire a 100 interest in 
 Adumo. Integrating Adumo 
into our company 
may require significant 
attention from our 
senior management which 
may divert their 
 attention 
from 
our 
day-to-day 
business. 
The 
difficulties 
of 
integration 
may 
be 
increased 
by 
cultural 
differences 
between 
our 
two 
 organizations and the necessity of retaining and integrating personnel, including Adumo s key employees and management team. The 
 services of these individuals will be important to the continued 
growth and success of Adumo s business and to our ability to integrate 
 Adumo with 
us. If 
we were 
to lose 
the services 
of these 
key employees 
or fail 
to sufficiently 
integrate them, 
our ability 
to operate 
 Adumo successfully would likely be materially and adversely impacted. 
 As such, if we are unable to successfully integrate Adumo s operations into our business we could be required to record material 
 impairments, and as a result, our financial condition, results of operations, 
cash flows and stock price could suffer. 
 We 
depend upon 
third-party suppliers, 
making us 
vulnerable to 
supply shortages 
and price 
fluctuations, which 
could harm 
 our business. 
 We 
obtain our 
smart cards, ATMs, 
electronic payment 
and POS devices, 
components for our 
safe assets, components 
to repair 
 the ISV (independent software vendor) 
division s POS hardware, and the other 
hardware we use in 
our business from a 
limited number 
 of suppliers, and 
do not manufacture 
this equipment ourselves. 
We generally do not have 
long-term agreements with 
our manufacturers 
 or component suppliers. 
If our suppliers 
become unwilling or 
unable to provide 
us with adequate 
supplies of parts 
or products when 
 we need them, 
or if they 
increase their prices, 
we may not 
be able to 
find alternative 
sources in a 
timely manner 
and could be 
faced 
 with a critical shortage. This 
could harm our ability to meet customer 
demand and cause our revenues 
to decline. Even if we are 
able 
 to secure alternative sources in a timely manner, 
our costs could increase as a result of supply or geopolitical shocks, which 
may lead 
 to 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
prices 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
from 
third 
parties.

supply 
interruption, 
such 
as 
the 
recent 
global 
shortage 
of 
 semiconductors, or 
an increase 
in demand 
beyond current 
suppliers capabilities 
could harm 
our ability 
to distribute 
our equipment 
 and thus to 
acquire new customers 
who use our 
technology. Any 
interruption in the 
supply of the 
hardware necessary to 
operate our 
 technology, or our inability to obtain substitute equipment at acceptable prices in a 
timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the 
 demand of our customers, which would have an adverse effect on 
our business. 
 We do 
not have a South African banking 
license and, therefore, we provide 
our EPE solution through an 
arrangement with 
 a third-party bank, which 
limits our control over this 
business and the economic benefit we 
derive from it. If 
this arrangement were 
 to terminate, 
we would 
not be 
able to 
operate our 
EPE business 
without alternate 
means of 
access to 
a banking 
license. We 
are 
 also required 
to comply 
with the 
requirements of 
payment schemes, 
including 
VISA and 
Mastercard. 
Furthermore, 
we provide 
 certain of 
our services under 
partnerships with South 
African banks. We will 
be unable to 
provide our payments 
and card-acquiring 
 businesses if we 
fail to comply 
with payment scheme 
rules, and/or fails 
to maintain certain 
regulatory licenses 
and registrations, 
 and/ or if we were unable to continue to partner with South African banks to provide 
our payments and card acquiring services. 

 The 
South 
African 
retail 
banking 
market 
is 
highly 
regulated. 
Under 
current 
law 
and 
regulations, 
our 
EasyPay 
Everywhere 
 EPE business activities require 
us to be registered as 
a bank in South Africa 
or to have access to an 
existing banking license. 
We 
 are not currently so registered, 
but we have an agreement 
with Grindrod Bank, a subsidiary 
of African Bank Limited, that 
enables us 
 to implement 
our EPE 
program in 
compliance 
with the 
relevant laws 
and regulations. 
If this 
agreement 
were to 
be terminated, 
we 
 would 
not 
be 
able 
to 
operate 
these 
services 
unless 
we 
were 
able 
to 
obtain 
access 
to 
a 
banking 
license 
through 
alternate 
means. 
 Furthermore, we have 
to comply with the 
South African Financial 
Intelligence Centre Act, 
2001 and money 
laundering and terrorist 
 financing 
control 
regulations, 
when 
we 
open 
new 
bank 
accounts 
for 
our 
customers 
and 
when 
they 
transact. 
Failure 
to 
effectively 
 implement and 
monitor responses 
to the 
legislation and 
regulations may 
result in 
significant fines 
or prosecution 
of Grindrod 
Bank 
 and ourselves. 

 We 
are required 
to comply 
with the 
requirements of 
payment schemes, 
including VISA 
and Mastercard. 
We 
have deployed 
a 
 significant number of devices, and any 
mandatory compliance upgrades to our deployed POS 
devices would require significant capital 
 expenditures and/or be 
disruptive to our 
customer base. Failure 
to comply with 
the payment schemes 
rules may result 
in significant 
 fines and/or a loss of license to participate in the scheme(s). 

56 
 We provide card acquiring services 
to our customers 
by partnering with 
Nedbank Limited and 
ABSA Bank Limited, 
and payment 
 processing services 
in partnership 
with the 
largest banks 
in South 
Africa. If 
these agreements 
were to 
be terminated, 
Adumo would 
 not be able to operate 
its payment services unless it 
were able to obtain 
alternative card acquiring or 
payment processing agreements 
 with other partners 
or obtain a direct 
designation license with 
the scheme's and 
regulatory bodies. In 
addition, if we 
were to lose our 
 PASA registrations 
or fail to have them renewed, it would be unable to operate its payment services. 
 Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may 
cause us to incur significant additional costs and 
 failure to 
comply with 
such requirements 
could result 
in the 
shutdown of 
the non-complying 
facility, 
the imposition 
of liens, 
fines 
 and/or civil or criminal liability. 
 In 
addition, 
the 
South 
African 
Financial 
Advisory 
and 
Intermediary 
Services 
Act, 
2002, 
requires 
persons 
who 
act 
as 
 intermediaries between financial product 
suppliers and consumers in 
South Africa to register 
as financial service providers. 
EasyPay 
 Insurance was 
granted a Financial 
Service Provider, 
or FSP, 
license on June 
9, 2015, and 
EasyPay Financial 
Services (Pty) Ltd 
was 
 granted 
a FSP 
license on 
July 11, 
2017. If 
our FSP 
licenses are 
withdrawn or 
suspended, we 
may be 
stopped from 
continuing our 
 financial 
services businesses in South Africa unless we are able to enter into a representative arrangement 
with a third party FSP. 
 Furthermore, the 
proposed Conduct 
of Financial 
Institutions Bill 
will make 
significant changes 
to the 
current licensing 
regime 
 however, the current proposal is that existing licences will be converted. The second draft of the Conduct of 
Financial Institutions Bill 
 was published for public comment on September 29, 2020. 
 Item 5. Other Information
