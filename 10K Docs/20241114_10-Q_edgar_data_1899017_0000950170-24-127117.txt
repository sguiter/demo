The Company s investment objective is to generate attractive risk adjusted returns, predominantly in the form of current income, with select investments exhibiting the ability to capture long-term capital appreciation. The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in middle-market direct lending opportunities across North America, Europe, Australia and in other geographic markets. Middle market companies generally means companies with between million and million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA ). The company focuses on senior secured credit investments with a first or second lien on collateral and strong structures and documentation intended to protect the lender, and mezzanine debt and other junior securities with a focus on downside protection. The Company may from time to time invest in smaller or larger companies if the opportunity presents attractive investment and risk adjusted returns. The Company may invest in common and preferred equity and in secondary purchases of assets or portfolios on an opportunistic basis, but such investments are not the principal focus of the investment strategy. The Company may also invest, from time to time, in distressed debt, debtor-in-possession loans, structured products, structurally subordinate loans, investments with deferred interest features, zero-coupon securities and defaulted securities.

provision for federal income taxes is recorded in the consolidated financial statements. The Company evaluated tax positions it has taken, expects to take or that are otherwise relevant to the Company for purposes of determining whether any relevant tax positions would more-likely-than-not be sustained by the applicable tax authority. The Company has analyzed such tax positions and has concluded that unrecognized tax benefits should be recorded for uncertain tax positions for tax years that may be open. The Company is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change materially in the next twelve months. The Company records tax positions that are not deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold as tax expenses as well as any applicable penalties or interest associated with such positions. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, tax expense was million and million, respectively.

 (2) Weighted average is calculated by weighing the significant unobservable input by the relative fair value of each investment in the category. 

 The Company used the income approach and market approach to determine the fair value of certain Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2024. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the comparative yield and discount rate. The comparative yield and discount rate are used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment. An increase/decrease in the comparative yield or discount rate would result in a decrease/increase, respectively, in the fair value. The significant unobservable input used in the market approach is the comparable company multiple. The multiple is used to estimate the enterprise value of the underlying investment. An increase/decrease in the multiple would result in an increase/decrease, respectively, in the fair value.

 (2) Weighted average is calculated by weighing the significant unobservable input by the relative fair value of each investment in the category. 

The Company used the income approach to determine the fair value of certain Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2023. The significant unobservable input used in the income approach is the comparative yield. The comparative yield is used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment. An increase/decrease in the comparative yield would result in a decrease/increase, respectively, in the fair value. Debt Not Carried at Fair Value Fair value is estimated by using market quotations or discounting remaining payments using applicable current market rates, which take into account changes in the Company s marketplace credit ratings, or market quotes, if available.

Incentive Fee Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base banagement fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding debt or preferred stock, but excluding any distribution or shareholder servicing fees and incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, original issue discount OID ), debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero-coupon securities, accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized or unrealized capital gains or losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that the Company may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company receives pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the Hurdle rate for a quarter, the Company will pay the applicable incentive fee even if the Company has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. The incentive fee is comprised of the following two parts: An incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income, which we refer to as the incentive fee on income or the Income Fee . The incentive fee on income is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income, attributable to each class of Common Shares, in respect of the current calendar quarter and the preceding calendar quarters (the Trailing Quarters ). Pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters will be compared to a Hurdle Amount equal to the product of (i) the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized) and (ii) the sum of the Company's net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Quarters. The quarterly incentive fee based on income shall be calculated, subject to the Incentive Fee Cap (as defined below), based on the amount by which (A) aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Quarters exceeds (B) the Hurdle Amount for such Trailing Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Twelve Quarters is referred to as the Excess Income Amount. The incentive fee based on income for each calendar quarter will be determined as follows: incentive fee based on income is payable to the Advisor for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess Income Amount; 

 of the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the Trailing Quarters with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Amount, but is less than or equal to an amount, which we refer to as the Catch-Up Amount, determined as the sum of multiplied by the Company's net asset value NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Quarters. The Catch-Up Amount is meant to provide the Advisor an incentive fee of on all of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income when the Company s aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters reaches the Catch-Up Amount in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters; and 

 of the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the Trailing Quarters that exceeds the Catch-Up Amount.

of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Quarters less the aggregate incentive fees based on income that were paid to the Advisor in the preceding calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Quarters. In the event the Incentive Fee Cap is less than the amount of incentive fee based on income that would otherwise be payable, the amount of incentive fee based on income shall be reduced to an amount equal to the Incentive Fee Cap. An incentive fee on capital gains (the Capital Gains Fee is calculated and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year will equal of the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of the fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Fees. 

 Cumulative Net Return during the relevant Trailing Quarters means (x) the pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters less (y) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company will pay no incentive fee based on income to the Advisor in respect of that quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the incentive fee based on income that is payable to the Advisor for such quarter calculated as described above, the Company will pay an incentive fee based on income to the Advisor equal to the Incentive Fee Cap in respect of such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the incentive fee based on income that is payable to the Advisor for such quarter calculated as described above, the Company will pay an incentive fee based on income to the Advisor equal to the incentive fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred million and million of income incentive fees (before waivers), respectively, which are included in incentive fees on the consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred million and million of income incentive fees (before waivers), respectively, which are included in incentive fees on the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was million and million related to income incentive fee accrued in incentive fee payable on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, respectively. There was capital gains incentive fee payable to the Advisor under the Investment Advisory Agreement or to BCSF Advisors, LP as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. US GAAP requires that the incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation of investments or other financial instruments in the calculation, as an incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement GAAP Incentive Fee ). There can be no assurance that such unrealized appreciation will be realized in the future. Accordingly, such fee, as calculated and accrued, would not necessarily be payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of incentive fees in subsequent period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company did t accrue any incentive fees related to the GAAP Incentive Fee.

The Managing Dealer also coordinates our marketing and distribution efforts with participating brokers and their registered representatives with respect to communications related to the terms of the offering, our investment strategies, material aspects of our operations and subscription procedures.

million and million for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with the counterparties on foreign currency exchange contracts. Collateral amounts posted are included in collateral on forward currency exchange contracts on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Collateral payable is included in collateral payable on forward currency exchange contracts on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company s average U.S. dollar notional exposure to forward currency exchange contracts were million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the company had no forward currency exchange contracts. By using derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the counterparty s credit risk the risk that derivative counterparties may not perform in accordance with the contractual provisions offset by the value of any collateral received. The Company s exposure to credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance is limited to collateral posted and the unrealized gains inherent in such transactions that are recognized in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The Company minimizes counterparty credit risk through credit monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements and managing margin and collateral requirements, as appropriate. The Company presents forward currency exchange contracts on a net basis by counterparty on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The Company has elected not to offset assets and liabilities in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities that may be received or paid as part of collateral arrangements, even when an enforceable master netting arrangement or other arrangement is in place that provides the Company, in the event of counterparty default, the right to liquidate collateral and the right to offset a counterparty s rights and obligations.

Item 2. M anagement s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. The discussion and analysis contained in this section refers to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Please see Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with this discussion and analysis. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed under Forward-Looking Statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 
 Overview 
 The Company is a newly organized, externally managed specialty finance company focused on lending to middle market companies. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We are managed by our Advisor, a subsidiary of Bain Capital Credit. Our Advisor is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act. Our Advisor also provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate in the capacity as the Administrator. The Company commenced operations on November 28, 2023. We seek to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation through direct originations of secured debt, including first lien, unitranche, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, subordinated debt, as well as through select equity investments, investments in strategic joint ventures and, to a lesser extent, corporate bonds. 
 We are a non-exchange traded, perpetual-life BDC whose shares are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or other securities market. The term perpetual-life is used to differentiate our structure from other BDCs who have a finite offering period and/or have a predefined time period to pursue a liquidity event or to wind down the fund. In contrast, in a perpetual-life BDC structure like ours, we expect to offer Common Shares continuously at a price equal the monthly NAV per share and we have an indefinite duration, with no obligation to effect a liquidity event at any time. We generally intend to offer our common shareholders an opportunity to have their shares repurchased on a quarterly basis, subject to an aggregate cap of 5 of shares outstanding. However, the determination to repurchase shares in any given quarter is fully at the discretion of our Board, so investors may not always have access to liquidity when they desire it. See Risk Factors. 
 Our primary focus is capitalizing on opportunities by investing primarily in middle market direct lending opportunities across North America, Europe and Australia and also in other geographic markets. We use the term middle market to refer to companies with between 10.0 million and 150.0 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We focus on (i) senior secured credit investments with a first or second lien on collateral and strong structures and documentation intended to protect the lender and (ii) mezzanine debt and other junior securities with a focus on downside protection. We may also invest in common and preferred equity and in secondary purchases of assets or portfolios, on an opportunistic basis, but such investments are not the principal focus of our investment strategy. 
 Following our initial public offering, the value at which our new Common Shares may be offered, or our Common Shares may be repurchased, will be equal to our monthly NAV per share. In addition, an investment in our Common Shares has limited or no liquidity beyond our share repurchase program, and our share repurchase program can be modified, suspended or terminated at the Board s discretion. Our Common Shares may be purchased by any investor who meets the minimum suitability requirements described under Suitability Standards in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Purchases of our Common Shares must be fully funded at the time of subscription. 
 We have a perpetual life and may continue to take in new capital on a continuous basis at a value generally equal to our NAV per share. We will be continually originating new investments to the extent we raise additional capital. We will also be regularly recycling capital from our existing investors into new investments. 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity may vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the level of investment and capital expenditures of such companies, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, eligible portfolio companies include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than 250 million. 
 52 

Table of Contents 

As a BDC, we may also invest up to 30 of our portfolio opportunistically in non-qualifying portfolio investments, such as investments in non-U.S. companies. 
 We may invest in debt securities which are either rated below investment grade or not rated by any rating agency but, if they were rated, would be rated below investment grade. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They may also be illiquid and difficult to value. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from various loan origination and other fees, dividends on direct equity investments and capital gains on the sales of investments. The companies in which we invest use our capital for a variety of reasons, including to support organic growth, to fund changes of control, to fund acquisitions, to make capital investments and for refinancing and recapitalizations. Leverage may be utilized to help the Company meet its investment objective. Any such leverage would be expected to increase the total capital available for investment by the Company. 
 Our debt investment portfolio consists of primarily floating rate loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 95.6 and 100.0 , respectively, of our debt investments, based on fair value, bore interest at floating rates, which may be subject to interest rate floors. Variable-rate investments subject to a floor generally reset periodically to the applicable floor, only if the floor exceeds the index. Trends in base interest rates, such as Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), may affect our net investment income over the long term. In addition, our results may vary from period to period depending on the interest rates of new investments made during the period compared to investments that were sold or repaid during the period; these results reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business or macroeconomic trends. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to the Advisor under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:

To the extent that expenses to be borne by us are paid by our Advisor, we will generally reimburse our Advisor for such expenses. To the extent the Administrator outsources any of its functions, we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to the Administrator. We also reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and any of their respective staff who provide services to us, operations staff who provide services to us, internal audit staff, if any, to the extent internal audit performs a role in our Sarbanes-Oxley Act internal control assessment and fees paid to third-party providers for goods or services. Our allocable portion of overhead will be determined by the Administrator, which expects to use various methodologies such as allocation based on the percentage of time certain individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs, and will be subject to oversight by the Board. We incurred expenses related to the Administrator and to BCSF Advisors, LP (in its former capacity as our administrator) of 0.4 million and 0.0 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The sub-administrator is paid its compensation for performing its sub-administrative services under the sub-administration agreement. We incurred expenses related to the sub-administrator of 0.4 million and 0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The Advisor will not be reimbursed to the extent that such reimbursements would cause any distributions to our shareholders to constitute a return of capital. All of the foregoing expenses are ultimately borne by our shareholders. 
 BCSF Advisors, LP, in its capacity as our investment adviser prior to September 28, 2023, and the Advisor advanced all expenses incurred on our behalf through the date on which we broke escrow for our offering. 
 Leverage 
 From time to time, we may borrow funds, including under our credit facilities, or issue debt securities or preferred securities to make additional investments or for other purposes. This is known as leverage and could increase or decrease returns to our shareholders. The use of borrowed funds or the proceeds of preferred securities offerings to make investments has specific benefits and risks, and all of the costs of borrowing funds or issuing preferred securities are borne by our shareholders. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we may only borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, is in compliance with the ratio for BDCs set forth in the 1940 Act. The Company is permitted to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage ratio is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). As of September 30, 2024, the Company's asset coverage ratio was 201.5 . 
 Our leverage may take the form of revolving or term loans from financial institutions, secured or unsecured bonds, securitization of portions of our investment portfolio via collateralized loan obligations or preferred shares. 
 Investment Decision Process 
 The Advisor s investment process can be broken into five processes: (1) Sourcing and Idea Generation, (2) Investment Diligence Recommendation, (3) Credit Committee Approval, (4) Portfolio Construction and (5) Portfolio Risk Management. 
 Sourcing and Idea Generation 
 The investment decision-making process begins with sourcing ideas. Bain Capital Credit s Private Credit Group interacts with a broad and deep set of global sourcing contacts, enabling the group to generate a large set of middle-market investment opportunities. Further enhancing the sourcing capability of the core Private Credit Group are Bain Capital Credit s industry groups, Trading Desk, and the Bain Capital Special Situations team. The team has extensive contacts with private equity firms. Relationships with banks, a variety of advisors and intermediaries and a handful of unique independent sponsors compose the remainder of the relationships. Through these sourcing efforts the Private Credit Group has built a sustainable deal funnel, which has generated hundreds of opportunities to review annually.

Table of Contents 

Investment Diligence Recommendation 
 Our Advisor utilizes Bain Capital Credit s bottom-up approach to investing, and it starts with due diligence. The Private Credit Group works with the close support of Bain Capital Credit s industry groups on performing due diligence. This process typically begins with a detailed review of the offering memorandum as well as Bain Capital Credit s own independent diligence efforts, including in-house materials and expertise, third-party independent research and interviews, and hands-on field checks where appropriate. For deals that progress beyond an initial stage, the team will schedule one or more meetings with company management, facilities visits and also meetings with the sponsor in order to ask more detailed questions and to better understand the sponsor s view of the business and plans for it going forward. The team s diligence work is summarized in investment memorandums and accompanying credit packs. Work product also includes full models and covenant analysis. The approval process itself is iterative, involving multiple levels of discussion and approval. 
 Credit Committee Approval 
 Given Bain Capital Credit s broad and diverse range of investment strategies, we tailor our investment decision-making process by strategy to provide a robust and comprehensive discussion of both individual investments and the applicable portfolio(s) under consideration. We believe that this flexible approach provides a rigorous investment decision-making process that allows us to be nimble across a variety of market environments while still maintaining high credit underwriting standards. 
 Our investments require approval from at least the Private Credit Investment Committee, which includes three Partners in the Private Credit Group as standing members: Michael Ewald, Mike Boyle, and Carolyn Hastings. Ad hoc members may also be included in the Private Credit Investment Committee for certain types of investments. 
 Portfolio Construction 
 Portfolio construction is largely the responsibility of the portfolio managers. The portfolio managers will construct the portfolio using a set of approved investments. While the decision to buy generally requires approval from at least the Private Credit Investment Committee, the decision to sell securities is at the sole discretion of the portfolio managers. For middle-market holdings, the path to exit an investment is discussed at credit committee meetings, including restructurings, acquisitions and sale to strategic buyers. Since most middle-market investments are illiquid, exits are driven primarily by a sale of the portfolio company or a refinancing of the portfolio company s debt. 
 Portfolio Risk Management 
 Our Advisor utilizes Bain Capital Credit s Private Credit Group for the daily monitoring of its respective credits after an investment has been made. Our Advisor believes that the ongoing monitoring of financial performance and market developments of portfolio investments is critical to successful investment management. Accordingly, our Advisor is actively involved in an on-going portfolio review process and attends board meetings. To the extent a portfolio investment is not meeting our Advisor s expectations, our Advisor takes corrective action when it deems appropriate, which may include raising interest rates, gaining a more influential role on its board, taking warrants and, where appropriate, restructuring the balance sheet to take control of the company. Our Advisor will utilize the Bain Capital Credit Risk and Oversight Committee. The Risk and Oversight Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing risk management, including portfolio risk, counterparty risk and firm-wide risk issues. In addition to the methods noted above, there are a number of proprietary methods and tools used through all levels of Bain Capital Credit to manage portfolio risk. 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 198.7 million, including PIK, in 31 portfolio companies, and had 37.2 million in aggregate amount of principal repayment and sales, resulting in a net increase in investment of 161.5 million for the period. Of the 198.7 million invested during the three months ended September 30, 2024, 30.4 million was related to drawdowns on delayed draw term loans and revolvers of our portfolio companies. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we invested 0.6 million in one portfolio company. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 387.6 million, including PIK, in 63 portfolio companies, and had 71.0 million in aggregate amount of principal repayment and sales, resulting in a net increase in investment of 316.6 million for the period. Of the 387.6 million invested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 32.1 million was related to drawdowns on delayed draw term loans and revolvers of our portfolio companies. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we invested 0.6 million in one portfolio company.

Loans or debt securities are placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest generally is reversed when a loan or debt security is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans or debt securities may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Non-accrual loans and debt securities are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to this treatment if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of September 30, 2024, there were no loans placed on non-accrual in the Company s portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, there were no loans placed on non-accrual in the Company's portfolio.

Our Advisor monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Advisor has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company s business plan and compliance with covenants; 

periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; 

attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and 

review of monthly and quarterly consolidated financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies. 

Our Advisor rates the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the rating of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments rated 3 or 4, our Advisor enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. Our internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. 
 An investment is rated 1 if, in the opinion of our Advisor, it is performing above underwriting expectations, and the business trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or the likelihood of a potential exit. 

An investment is rated 2 if, in the opinion of our Advisor, it is performing as expected at the time of our underwriting and there are generally no concerns about the portfolio company s performance or ability to meet covenant requirements, interest payments or principal amortization, if applicable. All new investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially given a rating of 2. 

An investment is rated 3 if, in the opinion of our Advisor, the investment is performing below underwriting expectations and there may be concerns about the portfolio company s performance or trends in the industry, including as a result of factors such as declining performance, non-compliance with debt covenants or delinquency in loan payments (but generally not more than 180 days past due). 

An investment is rated 4 if, in the opinion of our Advisor, the investment is performing materially below underwriting expectations. For debt investments, most of or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Investments rated 4 are not anticipated to be repaid in full, if applicable, and there is significant risk that we may realize a substantial loss on our investment.

Based on the weighted average Common Shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our per share net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was 2.38 and (48.66), respectively. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds from equity issuances, advances from our credit facilities (including the GS Revolving Credit Facility, JPM Revolving Credit Facility and the SMBC Revolving Credit Facility), debt issuances and cash flows from operations. We use the net proceeds from the offering to (1) make investments in accordance with our investment strategy and policies, (2) fund repurchases under our share repurchase program, and (3) for general corporate purposes. Generally, our policy is to pay distributions and operating expenses from cash flow from operations, however, we are not restricted from funding these items from proceeds from the offering of Common Shares or other sources and may choose to do so, particularly in the earlier part of the offering. 
 We intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time raise additional equity or debt capital through registered offerings, enter into additional debt facilities, or increase the size of existing facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. We are required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 150 after each issuance of senior securities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 260.8 million and 100.0 million outstanding senior securities, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 7.9 million and 19.3 million in cash, foreign cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 20.0 million of availability on our SMBC Revolving Credit Facility and 31.3 million of availability on our GS Revolving Credit Facility and 87.8 million on our JPM Revolving Credit Facility, subject to existing terms and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately 48.0 million of availability on our SMBC Revolving Credit Facility and 52.0 million of availability on our GS Revolving Credit Facility, subject to existing terms and regulatory requirements. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash, foreign cash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents decreased by 11.4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 306.3 million in cash for operating activities. The increase in cash used for operating activities was primarily related to the purchases of investments of 391.1 million, which was offset by proceeds from principal payments and sales of investments of 73.2 million and a net increase in assets resulting from operations of 16.8 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we were provided 294.8 million by financing activities, primarily due to borrowings on the GS Revolving Credit Facility, JPM Revolving Credit Facility and SMBC Revolving Credit Facility, proceeds from issuance of Common Shares and distributions paid to shareholders. 
 Equity 
 As of November 28, 2023, the Company had satisfied the minimum offering requirement, and the Board authorized the release of proceeds from escrow. As of such date, the Company issued and sold 4,027,980 shares (consisting entirely of Class I shares; no Class S or Class D shares were issued or sold as of such date) and the escrow agent released net proceeds to the Company as payment for shares. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 4,431,245 Class I shares, 0 Class S shares and 0 Class D shares issued and outstanding. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 12,373,415 Class I shares, 0 Class S shares and 0 Class D shares issued and outstanding.

Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the record date. To the extent that we have income available, we intend to distribute monthly distributions to our shareholders. Our monthly distributions, if any, will be determined by the Advisor. Any distributions to our shareholders will be declared out of assets legally available for distribution. 
 Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a US GAAP basis, include required adjustments to US GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions. The following table reflects the sources of cash distributions on a US GAAP basis that the Company has declared on its Common Shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

We commenced regular monthly distributions after breaking escrow on November 28, 2023. The Board delegated authority to declare distributions to the Advisor in an aggregate amount up to all of the Company s (i) taxable earnings; (ii) capital gains; (iii) net proceeds attributable to the repayment or disposition of investments (together with any interest, dividends and other net cash flow in respect of such investments); and (iv) any other amounts legally available for distribution to the extent the officers of the Company deem appropriate (including, if applicable, amounts representing a return of capital); provided each distribution shall not exceed an annualized distribution yield of 10 . Any distributions we make will be at the discretion of our Advisor, who will consider, among other things, our earnings, cash flow, capital needs and general financial condition, as well as our desire to comply with the RIC requirements, which generally require us to make aggregate annual distributions to our shareholders of at least 90 of our net investment income. As a result, our distribution rates and payment frequency may vary from time to time and there is no assurance we will pay distributions in any particular amount, if at all. 
 70 

Table of Contents 

The per share amount of distributions on Class S, Class D and Class I shares will generally differ because of different class-specific shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees that are deducted from the gross distributions for each share class. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not declare or pay any distributions. 
 We intend to elect to be treated, and intend to operate in a manner so as to continuously qualify, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2023. To qualify for and maintain RIC tax treatment, among other things, we must distribute dividends to our shareholders in respect of each taxable year of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of the sum of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of our net long-term capital losses. In order to avoid the imposition of certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends to our shareholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of: (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for such calendar year; (2) 98.2 of our capital gains in excess of capital losses, adjusted for certain ordinary losses, generally for the one-year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year; and (3) the sum of any net ordinary income plus capital gains net income for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no federal income tax. 
 The U.S. federal income tax characterization of distributions declared and paid for the fiscal year will be determined at fiscal year-end based upon our investment company taxable income for the full fiscal year and distributions paid during the full year. 
 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, which is an opt-out distribution reinvestment plan. 
 Under this plan, shareholders (other than those located in specific states, who are clients of selected participating brokers, as outlined below, or who have elected to opt out of the plan) will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the same class of our Common Shares to which the distribution relates. If a shareholder elects to opt out, that shareholder will receive cash distributions. The purchase price for shares purchased under our distribution reinvestment plan will be equal to the then-current NAV per share of the relevant class of Common Shares. Shareholders will not pay transaction related charges when purchasing shares under our distribution reinvestment plan, but all outstanding Class S and Class D shares, including those purchased under our distribution reinvestment plan, will be subject to ongoing servicing fees. The U.S. federal income tax characterization of distributions declared and paid for the fiscal year will be determined at fiscal year-end based upon our investment company taxable income for the full fiscal year and distributions paid during the full year. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 Subject to the discretion of the Board, we commenced a share repurchase program pursuant to which we intend to conduct quarterly repurchase offers to allow our shareholders to tender their shares at a price equal to the NAV per share for the applicable class of shares on each date of repurchase. Our Board may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time if it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. 
 Under our share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we intend to limit the number of shares to be repurchased to no more than 5 of our outstanding Common Shares as of the last day of the immediately preceding quarter. In the event the number of shares tendered exceeds the repurchase offer amount, shares will be repurchased on a pro rata basis. All unsatisfied repurchase requests must be resubmitted in the next quarterly tender offer, or upon the recommencement of the share repurchase program, as applicable. We may choose to offer to repurchase fewer shares than described above, or none at all. 
 We expect to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers each quarter using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived, at our discretion, in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders. We intend to conduct the repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares.

For additional information, see Note 5. Agreements and Related Party Transactions to the consolidated financial statements.

 Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The Company s consolidated financial statements and related financial information have been prepared pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10 Q and Articles 1, 6, 10 and 12 of Regulation S-X. These consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments that in the opinion of the Company are necessary for the fair statement of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented herein and are not necessarily indicative of the full fiscal year. We have determined we meet the definition of an investment company and follow the accounting and reporting guidance in the ASC 946. Our financial currency is U.S. dollars and these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in that currency. 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material.

Revenue Recognition 
 We record our investment transactions on a trade date basis. We record realized gains and losses based on the specific identification method. We record interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, on an accrual basis. Discount and premium to par value on investments acquired are accreted and amortized, respectively, into interest income over the life of the respective investment using the effective interest method. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized and amortized into or against interest income using the effective interest method or straight-line method, as applicable. We record any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts received upon prepayment of a loan or debt security as interest income. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for such distributions in the case of private portfolio companies, and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Distributions received from a limited liability company or limited partnership investment are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. 
 Certain investments may have contractual PIK interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the loan principal of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer. We record PIK as interest or dividend income, as applicable. If at any point we believe PIK may not be realized, we place the investment generating PIK on non-accrual status. 
 Certain structuring fees and amendment fees are recorded as other income when earned. We record administrative agent fees received as other income when the services are rendered. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 The Advisor shall value the investments owned by the Company, subject at all times to the oversight of the Board. The Advisor shall follow its own written valuation policies and procedures as approved by the Board when determining valuations. A short summary of the Advisor s valuation policies is below. 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board designates the Advisor as valuation designee to perform fair value determinations for the Company for investments that do not have readily available market quotations. Market quotations are obtained from an independent pricing service, where available. If a price cannot be obtained from an independent pricing service or if the independent pricing service is not deemed to be current with the market, certain investments held by the Company will be valued on the basis of prices provided by principal market makers. Generally, investments marked in this manner will be marked at the mean of the bid and ask of the independent broker quotes obtained. To validate market quotations, the Company utilizes a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available will be valued at a price that reflects such security s fair value. 
 With respect to unquoted portfolio investments, the Company will value each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, and other factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Company will use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and/or assist us in our valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, in particular, illiquid/hard to value assets, the Advisor will typically undertake a multi-step valuation process, which includes among other things, the below: 
 The Company s quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the Advisor responsible for the portfolio investment; 

Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the Company s senior management and the Advisor; 

Generally investments that constitute a material portion of the Company s portfolio are periodically reviewed by an independent valuation firm; and 

75 

Table of Contents 

The Board and Audit Committee provide oversight with respect to the valuation process, including requesting such materials as they deem appropriate. 

In following this approach, the types of factors that are taken into account in the fair value pricing of investments include, as relevant, but are not limited to: comparison to publicly traded securities, including factors such as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality; the enterprise value of a portfolio company; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows; and the markets in which the portfolio company does business. In cases where an independent valuation firm provides fair valuations for investments, the independent valuation firm provides a fair valuation report, a description of the methodology used to determine the fair value and their analysis and calculations to support their concluded ranges. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Advisor. Our Advisor has agreed to serve as our investment adviser in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay an annual base management fee as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. 
 On September 28, 2023, the Company entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Advisor. The Investment Advisory Agreement was approved by the Board and sole shareholder on September 28, 2023. In connection with the Company s entry into the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company s prior investment advisory agreement with BCSF Advisors, LP was terminated on September 28, 2023. The Investment Advisory Agreement has the same material terms as the prior investment advisory agreement. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 0.75 (0.1875 per quarter) of our gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage but excluding cash and cash equivalents and the incentive fee comprised of two parts, net investment income and capital gains. 
 We have entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator pursuant to which the Administrator will furnish us with administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. The Administration Agreement was approved by our Board on September 28, 2023. We reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including certain compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and any of their respective staff who provide services to us, operations staff who provide services to us, and internal audit staff, if any, to the extent internal audit performs a role in our Sarbanes-Oxley Act internal control assessment. In connection with our entry into the Administration Agreement, the Company s prior administration agreement with BCSF Advisors, LP (the Prior Administration Agreement was terminated on September 28, 2023. The Administration Agreement has the same material terms as the Prior Administration Agreement. 
 If any of our contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs may increase under any new agreements that we enter into as replacements. We would also likely incur expenses in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement.

Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. We will generally invest in illiquid loans and securities including debt and equity securities of middle-market companies. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Advisor as our valuation designee, subject to the Board s oversight, using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 
 Assuming that the statement of financial condition as of September 30, 2024, were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (dollars in thousands):

From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency. These investments are translated into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure investors that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may seek to utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. 
 It em 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures.

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under loans to or other contracts with our portfolio companies. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 Other than the shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, we did not sell any unregistered equity securities. 
 Share Repurchases 
 We have commenced a share repurchase program in which we intend to offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of our Common Shares outstanding (by number of shares) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. Our Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time if it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company as a whole, or should we otherwise determine that investing our liquid assets in originated loans or other illiquid investments rather than repurchasing our shares is in the best interests of the Company as a whole. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under our share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we expect to repurchase shares pursuant to quarterly tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV.

 (c)	Subject to Sections 2.03(e) and (f), the Company shall use the proceeds of any Financings received by it hereunder (i) to Originate or Purchase the Portfolio Investments identified in the related Approval Request, (ii) to pay for costs and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the establishment of the facility hereunder, and (iii) to make any applicable True-up Distribution or any applicable Permitted Distribution or Permitted Tax Distribution; provided that, if the proceeds of a Financing or other proceeds are deposited in the Principal Collection Account or a Permitted Non-USD Currency Account as provided in Section 3.01 on the expected Settlement Date for any Portfolio Investment but the Company is unable to Originate or Purchase such Portfolio Investment on such expected Settlement Date, or if there are proceeds of such Financing or other proceeds remaining after such Origination or Purchase and any applicable True-up Distribution, then, upon the written request of the Servicer within ten (10) Business Days after such expected Settlement Date, the Administrative Agent will direct the Collateral Agent to withdraw such proceeds from the Principal Collection Account or the applicable Permitted Non-USD Currency Account and, ratably based on the proceeds funded by such Person, (i) with respect to proceeds of Advances, repay such Advances and (ii) with respect to proceeds of equity contributions, refund such proceeds to the applicable equity holder. The proceeds of the Financings shall not be used for any other purpose except to the extent expressly set forth in the Effective Date Letter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Administrative Agent has approved an Approval Request with respect to a particular Portfolio Investment, such Portfolio Investment has been Originated or Purchased, as applicable, and the Parent or its Affiliate has funded such Origination or Purchase on behalf of the Company, the proceeds of the Advance with respect to such Portfolio Investment may be used to repay such Person to the extent of such funding. 
 (d)	With respect to any Advance, the Servicer on behalf of the Company shall submit a request substantially in the form of Exhibit A to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, with a copy to the Collateral Agent and the Collateral Administrator, not later than 2:00 p.m. (or, with respect to the Initial Loans, 5:00 p.m.) New York City time, one (1) Business Day (or, (i) in the case of an Advance denominated in AUD, two (2) Business Days, (ii) in the case of an Advance denominated in SEK, four (4) Business Days and (iii) in the case of an Advance denominated in NZD, five (5) Business Days) prior to the Business Day specified as the date on which such Advance shall be made and, upon receipt of such request, the Lenders shall make such Advances in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 3.01. 
 (e)	The Company or the Servicer on its behalf may request an Advance during the Reinvestment Period to fund any draw of an unfunded commitment in respect of a Delayed Funding Term 
 - 39 - 

Loan or a Revolving Loan, and the Lenders shall make a corresponding Advance no sooner than the immediately succeeding Business Day, and no later than the date the Company requests that such Advance be funded, subject to and in accordance with Article III. If, on any date of determination prior to the last day of the Reinvestment Period, there exists an Unfunded Exposure Shortfall, the Company shall (x) (i) request an Advance not later than two (2) Business Days following the date on which such Unfunded Exposure Shortfall commences and, if the conditions to such Advance are satisfied and such Advance is made in accordance with this Agreement, deposit the proceeds thereof in the Unfunded Exposure Account (or, in the case of any Unfunded Exposure Amount in respect of a Portfolio Investment denominated in a Permitted Non-USD Currency, into the applicable Permitted Non-USD Currency Unfunded Exposure Account) and/or (ii) not later than two (2) Business Days following the date on which such Unfunded Exposure Shortfall commences, deposit cash from other sources into the Unfunded Exposure Account in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate Unfunded Exposure Shortfall or (y) not later than two (2) Business Days following the date on which such Unfunded Exposure Shortfall commences, assign one or more Delayed Funding Term Loans or Revolving Loans to the Parent as a non-cash dividend (which assignment(s) shall be settled not more than seven (7) Business Days following the date on which the Unfunded Exposure Shortfall commences and, upon which transfer(s), the applicable Delayed Funding Term Loan(s) or Revolving Loan(s), as applicable, will be released from the security interest under this Agreement without further action by any Person) such that, after giving effect to such transfer(s), the Unfunded Exposure Shortfall ceases to exist. If the aggregate Unfunded Exposure Amount is greater than zero at the end of the Reinvestment Period provided that the Reinvestment Period ends pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of such term), the Company shall request an Advance in the applicable Eligible Currency in an amount that, when combined with any cash contribution by the Parent to the Company on such date, equals the aggregate Unfunded Exposure Amount, the Lenders shall make a corresponding Advance no sooner than the immediately succeeding Business Day, and no later than the date the Company requests that such Advance be funded, in accordance with and subject to Article III, and the Company shall deposit the proceeds of such Advance in the Unfunded Exposure Account (or, in the case of any Unfunded Exposure Amount in respect of a Portfolio Investment denominated in a Permitted Non-USD Currency, into the applicable Permitted Non-USD Currency Unfunded Exposure Account). Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or a Market Value Cure Failure, the Company shall deposit the aggregate Unfunded Exposure Amount on such date (less any amounts already on deposit in the Unfunded Exposure Account) into the Unfunded Exposure Account (or, in the case of any Unfunded Exposure Amount in respect of a Portfolio Investment denominated in a Permitted Non-USD Currency, into the applicable Permitted Non-USD Currency Unfunded Exposure Account). Promptly following the earlier of the date on which any Delayed Funding Term Loan or Revolving Loan becomes an Ineligible Investment or the date on which a Final Approval Request in respect of a draw of an unfunded commitment under such Delayed Funding Term Loan or Revolving Loan is not approved, the Company shall (x) deposit the portion of the Unfunded Exposure Amount relating to such Delayed Funding Term Loan or Revolving Loan into the Unfunded Exposure Account (or, in the case of any Unfunded Exposure Amount in respect of a Portfolio Investment denominated in a Permitted Non-USD Currency, into the applicable Permitted Non-USD Currency Unfunded Exposure Account) or (y) transfer such Delayed Funding Term Loan or Revolving Loan, as applicable, to the Parent as a non-cash dividend (upon which transfer, such Delayed Funding Term Loan or Revolving Loan will be released from the security interest under this Agreement without further action by any Person). If, at any time, the amount on deposit on the Unfunded Exposure Account (together with related amounts in respect of Unfunded Exposure Amounts relating to Portfolio Investments denominated in a Permitted Non-USD Currency deposited into the applicable Permitted Non-USD Currency Unfunded Exposure Account) is greater than the aggregate Unfunded Exposure Amount, the Company may direct that any such excess be transferred to the Principal Collection Account or the applicable Permitted Non-USD Currency Principal Collection Account for application as Principal Proceeds (or, in the case of amounts deposited into the Unfunded Exposure Account by the Company and not from the proceeds of an Advance or a prepayment in respect of a Revolving Loan, Interest Proceeds) in accordance with this Agreement. In addition and without 
 - 40 - 

limitation to the foregoing, if (i) the Company is required to deposit amounts into the Unfunded Exposure Account as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default or a Market Value Cure Failure, (ii) such Event of Default or Market Value Cure Failure has been cured or waived and (iii) no subsequent Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and no subsequent Market Value Cure Failure has occurred, the Company may direct that any such amount be withdrawn and be applied as Principal Proceeds or Interest Proceeds. Amounts in the Unfunded Exposure Account and the Permitted Non-USD Currency Unfunded Exposure Accounts may be applied (A) for the purposes set forth in this paragraph above and (B) so long as no Market Value Cure Failure has occurred and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to fund unfunded commitments in respect of Delayed Funding Term Loans or Revolving Loans and, upon acceleration of the Secured Obligations following an Event of Default, shall be transferred to the Principal Collection Account (in the case of amounts on deposit in the Permitted Non-USD Currency Unfunded Exposure Account, after conversion to USD at the Spot Rate). 
 (f)	Without limitation to any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not acquire any unfunded commitment under any Delayed Funding Term Loan or Revolving Loan unless, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such purchase, the Compliance Condition and item 11 of the Concentration Limitations will each be satisfied and no Unfunded Exposure Shortfall will exist on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such purchase and any concurrent Advance to fund a deposit into the Unfunded Exposure Account or the applicable Permitted Non-USD Currency Unfunded Exposure Account in accordance with Section 2.03(e), as shall be deemed certified by the delivery by the Company of any trade ticket, order, direction or other instruction in connection with the acquisition of any such Delayed Funding Term Loan or Revolving Loan. 
 (g)	If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, all or any part of any Advance not made by such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders who notify the Administrative Agent in writing (including via email) that they will accept such reallocation, on a pro rata basis (determined without regard to the outstanding Advances and Financing Commitments of the Defaulting Lender and any non-Defaulting Lender not providing such notice), but only to the extent that such reallocation does not, as to any non-Defaulting Lender, cause such non-Defaulting Lender's outstanding Advances and unfunded commitments hereunder to exceed its Financing Commitment.

 - 44 - 

the extent permitted under Section 2.03). Each Lender at its option may make any Advance by causing any domestic or foreign branch or affiliate of such Lender to make such Advance, provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Company to repay such Advance in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Once drawn, Advances may only be repaid, prepaid or reborrowed in accordance with this Agreement. 
 (b)	 Interest on the Advances . All outstanding Advances shall bear interest (from and including the date on which such Advance is made) at a per annum rate equal to the applicable Reference Rate (except as expressly set forth herein) for each Calculation Period in effect plus , in each case, the Applicable Margin for Advances set forth on the Transaction Schedule. In addition, if, at any time during the Reinvestment Period, the outstanding Advances are less than the Adjusted Principal Amount at such time, the Company shall incur interest on the difference of the Adjusted Principal Amount minus the amount of Advances at such time at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin for Advances set forth on the Transaction Schedule minus the per annum rate payable in respect of commitment fees pursuant to Section 4.03(e).

Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Company to such Lender resulting from each Advance made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder and the Eligible Currency thereof. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Company, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States a register (the Register in which it shall record the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Financing Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances (and related interest amounts) due and payable or to become due and payable from the Company to each Lender hereunder and the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company, the Collateral Agent and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
 Any Lender may request that Advances made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Company shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender and its registered assigns and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Advances evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to such payee and its registered assigns. 
 (d)	 Pro Rata Treatment . Except as otherwise provided herein or any Lender Letter Agreement, all borrowings of, and payments in respect of, the Advances shall be made on a pro rata basis

 (e)	 Illegality . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company that the adoption of any law, rule or regulation, or any change therein or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for a Lender or the Administrative Agent to perform its obligations hereunder to fund or maintain Advances in the applicable Eligible Currency hereunder, then (1) the obligation of such Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder to fund or maintain Advances in such Eligible Currency shall immediately be suspended until such time as such Lender or the Administrative Agent determines (in its sole discretion) that such performance is again lawful, (2) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall use reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, other than immaterial, incidental expenses), to transfer within twenty (20) days after it gives notice under this clause (e), all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to another of its offices, branches or affiliates with respect to which such performance would not be unlawful, and (3) if such Lender or the Administrative Agent is unable to effect a transfer under clause (2), then any outstanding Advances of such Lender in such Eligible Currency shall (i) be promptly paid in full by the Company (together with all accrued interest and other amounts owing hereunder) but not later than the end of the then-current Calculation Period (or, if sooner repayment is required by law, be repaid immediately upon request of such Lender) or (ii) in the case of Advances denominated in a Permitted Non-USD Currency, if requested by the Company, be converted to Advances denominated in USD on the date specified by the Administrative Agent at the Spot Rate, become denominated in USD and thereafter bear interest at the rates applicable to Advances denominated in USD and, in such event, the Company shall pay all amounts owning in connection therewith, including all interest accrued on the Advances being converted through such date; p rovided that, to the extent that any such adoption or change makes it unlawful for the Advances to bear interest by reference to any Reference Rate, then the foregoing clauses (1) through (3) shall not apply and the Advances bearing interest at such Reference Rate shall bear interest (from and after the last day of the Calculation Period ending immediately after such adoption or change) at a per annum rate equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Advances set forth on the Transaction Schedule. 
 (f)	 Increased Costs . 
 (i)	If any Change in Law shall: 
 (1)	impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity or similar requirement (including any compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender; 
 (2)	impose on any Lender or the market for any Reference Rate any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or the Advance (or portion thereof) made or held by such Lender (other than as a result of any actions taken pursuant to Section 3.01(g)(ii) below); or 
 (3)	subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (x) Indemnified Taxes and (y) Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; 
 - 46 - 

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or the Administrative Agent of making, continuing, converting or maintaining the Advance or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, upon request by such Lender or the Administrative Agent, the Company will pay to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
 (ii)	If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Advance (or portion thereof) made or held by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
 (iii)	A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate, and the basis for such compensation of, such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate on the Payment Date corresponding to the first Payment Date Report prepared and delivered after receipt thereof. 
 (iv)	Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Administrative Agent notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180 day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
 (v)	Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent agrees that it will take such commercially reasonable actions as the Company may reasonably request that will avoid the need to pay, or reduce the amount of, any increased amounts referred to in this Section 3.01(f); provided that no Lender or the Administrative Agent shall be obligated to take any actions that would, in the reasonable opinion of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, be disadvantageous to such Lender or the Administrative Agent (including, without limitation, due to a loss of money).

 (g)	 Interest Rate Unascertainable; Alternate Rate of Interest .

 - 47 - 

commercially reasonable judgment) determines that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining a Reference Rate (including, without limitation, because such Reference Rate is not available or published on a current basis) for the applicable Eligible Currency and such Calculation Period; provided that no Benchmark Transition Event shall have occurred at such time or (y) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Financing Providers that the applicable Reference Rate for the applicable Eligible Currency and such Calculation Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Advances (or its Advance) included in such Advance for such Calculation Period (determined in their commercially reasonable judgment), then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company, the Servicer and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter (with a copy to the Collateral Agent) and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company, the Servicer and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, any Advance denominated in such Eligible Currency made by the Lenders shall thereupon constitute a Base Rate Advance. 
 (ii)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then if a Benchmark Replacement has been determined in accordance with the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of a reasonable objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Financing Providers. 
 (iii)	[Reserved]. 
 (iv)	In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Company, will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time by delivery of a notice of such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 3.01(g)(v) below and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 3.01(g), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 3.01(g).

 (b)	 Replacement of Lenders .
