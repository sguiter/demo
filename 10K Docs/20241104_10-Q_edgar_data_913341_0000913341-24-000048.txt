 Residential mortgage Equity lines Other consumer Consumer finance - automobiles Consumer finance - marine and recreational vehicles Total Occasionally, the Corporation modifies loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by providing principal forgiveness, term extensions, interest rate reductions or other-than-insignificant payment delays. As the effect of most modifications is already included in the allowance for credit losses due to the measurement methodologies used in its estimate, the allowance for credit losses is typically not adjusted upon modification. When principal forgiveness is provided at modification, the amount forgiven is charged against the allowance for credit losses. In some cases, the Corporation may provide multiple types of modifications on one loan and when multiple types of modifications occur within the same period, the combination of modifications is separately reported. The following tables present the amortized cost basis of loans as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 that were both experiencing financial difficulty and modified during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Additionally, the community banking segment purchases residential mortgage loans from the mortgage banking segment under terms and conditions similar to third-party investors. As is customary in the industry, the agreements with these investors require the mortgage banking segment to extend representations and warranties with respect to program compliance, borrower misrepresentation, fraud, and early payment performance. Under the agreements, the investors are entitled to make loss claims and repurchase requests of the mortgage banking segment for loans that contain covered deficiencies. The mortgage banking segment has obtained early payment default recourse waivers for a portion of its business. Recourse periods for early payment default for the remaining investors vary from up to . Recourse periods for borrower misrepresentation or fraud, or underwriting error do not have a stated time limit. The mortgage banking segment maintains an allowance for indemnifications that represents management s estimate of losses that are probable of arising under these recourse provisions. As performance data for loans that have been sold is not made available to the mortgage banking segment by the investors, the estimate of potential losses is inherently subjective and is based on historical indemnification payments and management s assessment of current conditions that may contribute to indemnified losses on mortgage loans that have been sold in the secondary market. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation recorded a net reversal of provision for indemnifications of and , respectively, and recorded a net reversal of provision for indemnifications of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which is included in Noninterest Expenses Other on the Consolidated Statements of Income. indemnification payments were made during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The mortgage banking segment enters into IRLCs with customers to originate loans for which the interest rates are determined (or locked prior to funding. The mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk through fixed-rate IRLCs and mortgage loans from the time that interest rates are locked until the loans are sold in the secondary market. The mortgage banking segment mitigates this interest rate risk by entering into forward sales contracts with investors, which at times includes the community banking segment, at the time that interest rates are locked for mortgage loans to be delivered on a best efforts basis. IRLCs are derivative financial instruments and are reported at fair value in other assets and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, along with the changes in fair value of the related forward sales of loans. Changes in the fair value of mortgage banking derivatives are recorded as a component of gains on sales of loans.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion supplements and provides information about the major components of the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of the Corporation. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements. For additional information regarding the Company s results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, please refer to our first and second quarter Form 10-Qs filed with the SEC on May 7, 2024 and August 2, 2024, respectively. In addition to current and historical information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to our future business, financial condition or results of operations. For a description of certain factors that may have a significant impact on our future business, financial condition or results of operations, see Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this discussion and analysis. OVERVIEW Our primary financial goals are to maximize the Corporation s earnings and to deploy capital in profitable growth initiatives that will enhance long-term shareholder value. We track three primary financial performance measures in order to assess the level of success in achieving these goals: (1) return on average assets (ROA), (2) return on average equity (ROE), and (3) growth in earnings. In addition to these financial performance measures, we track the performance of the Corporation s three business segments: community banking, mortgage banking, and consumer finance. We also actively manage our capital through growth, dividends and share repurchases, while considering the need to maintain a strong capital position. The following table presents selected financial performance highlights for the periods indicated: TABLE 1: Financial Performance Highlights

Consolidated net income decreased 357,000 and 4.8 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 due primarily to lower net income of the community banking segment and consumer finance segment, partially offset by higher net income of the mortgage banking segment. A discussion of the performance of our business segments is included under the heading Business Segments in the Results of Operations section of this discussion and analysis.

 Key highlights for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 are as follows. Community banking segment loans grew 158.5 million, or 16.6 percent annualized, compared to December 31, 2023; Consumer finance segment loans grew 8.8 million, or 2.5 percent annualized, compared to December 31, 2023; Deposits increased 69.8 million, or 4.5 percent annualized, compared to December 31, 2023; Consolidated annualized net interest margin was 4.13 percent for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4.29 percent for the third quarter of 2023 and 4.12 percent in the second quarter of 2024; The community banking segment recorded provision for credit losses of 700,000 and 1.7 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 500,000 and 1.6 million for the same periods in 2023; The consumer finance segment recorded provision for credit losses of 3.0 million and 8.1 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 1.6 million and 4.3 million for the same periods in 2023; The consumer finance segment experienced net charge-offs at an annualized rate of 2.36 percent of average total loans for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 1.75 percent for the first nine months of 2023; Mortgage banking segment loan originations were 157.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 27.3 million, or 21.1 percent, and an increase of 11.0 million, or 7.5 percent, compared to the third quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024, respectively; During the third quarter of 2024, the community banking segment opened a new retail banking branch in Colonial Heights, Virginia and announced the closure of its Hampton, Virginia branch in the fourth quarter of 2024. Capital Management and Dividends Total equity was 228.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 217.5 million at December 31, 2023. Under regulatory capital standards, the Corporation s tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios at September 30, 2024 were 11.6 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively, compared to 12.6 percent and 14.8 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the Corporation s tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was due primarily to growth in risk-weighted assets resulting from higher balances of loans outpacing growth in equity. At September 30, 2024, the book value per share of the Corporation s common stock was 70.29, and tangible book value per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, was 62.13, compared to 64.28 and 56.40, respectively, at December 31, 2023. Total equity increased 10.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, due primarily to net income and lower unrealized losses in the market value of securities available for sale, which are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income, partially offset by share repurchases and dividends paid on the Corporation s common stock. The Corporation s securities available for sale are fixed income debt securities and their unrealized loss position, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, is a result of rising market interest rates since they were purchased. The Corporation expects to recover its investments in debt securities through scheduled payments of principal and interest, and unrealized losses are not expected to affect the earnings or regulatory capital of the Corporation or C F Bank. The accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the Corporation s securities available for sale decreased to 17.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 25.0 million at December 31, 2023, as a result of fluctuations in debt security market interest rates. The Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of 44 cents per share during the third quarter of 2024, which was paid on October 1, 2024. This dividend represents a payout ratio of 26.7 percent of earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024. The Board of Directors of the Corporation continually reviews the amount of cash dividends per share and the resulting dividend payout ratio in light of changes in economic conditions, current and future capital levels and requirements and expected future earnings. In making its decision on the payment of dividends on the Corporation s common stock, the Corporation s Board of Directors considers operating results, financial condition, capital adequacy, regulatory requirements, shareholder returns, growth expectations and other factors.

 The Corporation has a share repurchase program that was authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10.0 million of the Corporation s common stock, effective January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, the Corporation repurchased 60,520 shares, or 3.2 million, and 149,594 shares, or 7.3 million, of its common stock under this share repurchase program, respectively. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Those accounting policies with the greatest uncertainty and that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments affecting the application of these policies, and the greatest likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, or using different assumptions, are described below. Allowance for Credit Losses: We establish the allowance for credit losses through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the estimated net realizable value or fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent, when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance represents management s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of loans held for investment, and is recorded at an amount that, in management s judgment, reduces the recorded investment in loans to the net amount expected to be collected. Management s judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of historical loan losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts relevant to the collectability of loans. The measurement of the allowance for credit losses on commercial and consumer loans is based in part on forecasts of the national unemployment rate, which we believe to be indicative of risk factors related to the collectability of commercial and consumer loans. In addition, management s estimate of expected credit losses is based on the remaining life of loans held for investment, and changes in expected prepayment behavior may result in changes in the remaining life of loans and expected credit losses. Management also assesses the risk of credit losses arising from changes in general market, economic and business conditions; the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; the volume and severity of delinquencies and adversely classified loan balances and the value of underlying collateral in determining the recorded balance of the allowance for credit losses. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. In evaluating the level of the allowance, we consider a range of possible assumptions and outcomes related to the various factors identified above. The level of the allowance is particularly sensitive to changes in the actual and forecasted national unemployment rate and changes in current conditions or reasonably expected future conditions affecting the collectability of loans. Goodwill: The Corporation s goodwill was recognized in connection with past business combinations and is reported at the community banking segment and the consumer finance segment. The Corporation reviews the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators exist. In testing goodwill for impairment, the Corporation may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then no further testing is required and the goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the Corporation elects to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. In the last evaluation of goodwill at the community banking segment and the consumer finance segment, which was the annual evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Corporation concluded that no impairment existed based on an assessment of qualitative factors. For further information concerning accounting policies, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under the heading Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, for the first nine months of 2024 decreased to 72.5 million, compared to 74.5 million for the first nine months of 2023, due primarily to a decrease in net interest margin, partially offset by higher average balances of earning assets. Annualized net interest margin decreased 16 basis points to 4.13 percent for the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 26 basis points to 4.11 percent for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023, due primarily to an increase in costs of interest-bearing deposits

 and a shift to higher cost deposits, partially offset by an increase in yields and higher balances of earning assets. Annualized net interest margin increased to 4.13 percent for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4.12 percent and 4.09 percent for the second quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2024, respectively. The Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) increased the target federal funds interest rate from an upper limit of 4.50 percent at December 31, 2022 to 5.50 percent by September 30, 2023, where it remained unchanged until September 2024 when it was lowered to 5.00 percent. The yield on interest-earning assets increased by 48 basis points and 47 basis points for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 82 basis points and 97 basis points for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. Average earning assets increased 119.0 million and 77.1 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 144.8 million and 113.4 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased 39.6 million and 49.5 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Average loans, which includes both loans held for investment and loans held for sale, increased 204.9 million to 1.93 billion for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 165.5 million to 1.87 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. Average loans at the community banking segment increased 186.5 million, or 15.2 percent, for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 158.4 million, or 13.2 percent, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to growth in the construction, commercial real estate, and residential mortgage segments of the loan portfolio. Average loans at the consumer finance segment increased 8.3 million, or 1.8 percent, for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 3.0 million, or less than 1.0 percent, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to an increase in the marine and recreational vehicles segment of the loan portfolio. Average loans at the mortgage banking segment, which consist of loans held for sale, increased 10.0 million, or 33.2 percent, for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 4.0 million, or 15.2 percent, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The community banking segment average loan yield increased 43 basis points to 5.58 percent for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 42 basis points to 5.48 percent for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to the effects of the higher interest rate environment. The consumer finance segment average loan yield increased 39 basis points to 10.48 percent for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 43 basis points to 10.37 percent for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to the effects of the higher interest rate environment, partially offset by the effects of purchasing higher credit quality loan contracts which have lower yields. The mortgage banking segment average loan yield decreased 89 basis points to 5.90 percent for the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 44 basis points to 6.13 percent for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due to fluctuations in mortgage interest rates and in the mix of mortgage loan products originated. Average securities available for sale decreased 86.1 million and 85.5 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to maturities of U.S. treasury and government agency securities outpacing purchases in all sectors of the portfolio. The average yield on the securities portfolio on a taxable-equivalent basis increased 31 basis points to 2.70 percent for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 28 basis points to 2.62 percent for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to the higher interest rate environment and the maturity of lower-yielding securities. Average interest-bearing deposits in other banks, consisting primarily of excess cash reserves maintained at the FRB, increased 200,000 for the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 2.9 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits in other banks increased 9 basis points for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 21 basis points for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due to the higher interest rate environment. Average money market, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits combined and average non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased 54.8 million and 39.6 million, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024, and decreased 93.1 million and 49.5 million, respectively, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases in both periods were due primarily to customers seeking higher yielding opportunities as a result of higher interest rates paid on time deposits. Average time deposits increased 230.2 million and 243.7 million for the third quarter and first

 nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 97 basis points for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 114 basis points for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to higher rates on money market and time deposits, a shift in composition towards time deposits amid the higher interest rate environment and increased competition for deposits. Average borrowings decreased 30.5 million and 37.2 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to fluctuations in repurchase agreements and net paydowns of Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB) advances. The average cost of borrowings decreased 7 basis points for the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 10 basis points for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to a shift in the mix of borrowings related to paydowns of higher-rate short-term borrowings, partially offset by the effects of higher interest rates. The Corporation believes that the effects of declining market interest rates could adversely affect its net interest margin in the short term as its assets typically reprice downward more quickly than its deposits and borrowings. The Corporation also believes that the higher interest rate environment will continue to have a positive effect on yields of renewals of fixed rate loans originated during periods of lower interest rates and purchases of securities available for sale. The Corporation also expects that a portion of the Corporation s funding will continue to be drawn from borrowings in the near term, which may result in a higher cost of funds. The effect of these factors on the Corporation s net interest margin will depend on a number of factors, including the Corporation s ability to grow loans at the community banking segment and consumer finance segment, to compete for deposits, and the extent of its reliance on borrowings. The Corporation can give no assurance as to the timing or extent of changes in market interest rates or the impact of those changes or any other factor on the Corporation's ability to compete for loans and deposits or on its net interest margin. If market interest rates were to rise, net interest margin could be positively impacted in the short term as the Corporation generally expects its assets to reprice upward more quickly than its deposits and borrowings.

The increase for the third quarter of 2024 also included higher gains on sales of loans due to higher volume of mortgage loan originations. The Corporation uses a rabbi trust to fund liabilities under its nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Unrealized gains and losses on investments held in the Corporation s rabbi trust are offset by changes in deferred compensation liabilities, recorded in salaries and employee benefits expense.

Additionally, the mortgage banking segment recorded a net reversal of provision for indemnifications for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 of 100,000 and 375,000, respectively, compared to a net reversal of provision for indemnifications of 200,000 and 435,000 for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2023, respectively. Changes in deferred compensation liabilities are offset by unrealized gains and losses on investments held in the Corporation s rabbi trust and are recorded in noninterest income. Income Taxes The Corporation s consolidated effective income tax rate was 18.7 percent for the third quarter of 2024, an increase compared to 18.6 percent for the same period in 2023 due primarily to a lower share of income at the community banking segment, which is primarily not subject to state income taxes. The Corporation s consolidated effective income tax rate was 17.8 percent for the first nine months of 2024, a decrease compared to 18.8 percent for the same period in 2023 due primarily to a higher share of income at the community banking segment, which is primarily not subject to state income taxes. Business Segments The Corporation operates in a decentralized manner in three business segments: community banking, mortgage banking and consumer finance. An overview of the financial results for each of the Corporation s business segments is presented below. Community Banking: The community banking segment comprises C F Bank, C F Wealth Management, C F Insurance and CVB Title.

The decreases in community banking segment net income were due primarily to: higher interest expense due primarily to higher rates on deposits and higher balances of interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower balances of borrowings; higher salaries and employee benefits expense for the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, which have generally increased in line with market conditions. Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased to 8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.1 million and 9.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, due primarily to a reduction in headcount through attrition; higher occupancy expense related to branch network improvements, including the relocation of a branch and the opening of a new branch; and higher data processing and consulting costs related to investments in operational technology to improve resilience, efficiency and customer experience; partially offset by: higher interest income resulting from the effects of higher interest rates on asset yields and higher average balances of loans, offset in part by lower average balances of securities; and higher wealth management services income as assets under management increased 19.0 percent for the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.

 Net interest income for the community banking segment decreased by 126,000 to 18.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 3.3 million to 52.9 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 due primarily to a decrease in net interest margin, partially offset by higher average balances of earning assets. Included in net interest income is interest income on variable rate loans to the consumer finance and mortgage banking segments. Average loan yields and average costs of interest-bearing deposits were higher for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023, due primarily to the effects of the higher interest rate environment. The community banking segment recorded 700,000 and 1.7 million in provision for credit losses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, due primarily to growth in the loan portfolio, compared to 500,000 and 1.6 million in provision for credit losses for the same periods in 2023. Noninterest income increased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to higher wealth management services income and higher investment income from other equity interests. Noninterest expenses increased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to higher occupancy, data processing and other expenses.

 higher variable expenses tied to mortgage loan origination volume such as commissions and bonuses, reported in salaries and employee benefits, and data processing expenses. The mortgage banking segment reported net income of 1.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 568,000 for the same period of 2023, due primarily to: lower variable expenses tied to mortgage loan origination volume such as commissions and bonuses, reported in salaries and employee benefits, as well as mortgage banking loan processing expenses and data processing expenses; lower occupancy expense due to an effort to reduce overhead costs; higher mortgage banking fee income; and relatively unchanged gains on sales of loans and mortgage loan production volume; partially offset by: lower mortgage lender services income due lower mortgage loan production volume across the industry. The following table presents mortgage loan originations and mortgage loans sold for the periods indicated. TABLE 8: Mortgage Loan Originations

 1 Total mortgage loan originations does not include mortgage lender services. 2 Lock-adjusted originations includes an estimate of the effect of changes in the volume of mortgage loan applications in process that have not closed, net of volume not expected to close. Elevated level of mortgage interest rates, combined with higher home prices and lower levels of inventory, has led to a level of mortgage loan originations in 2024 and 2023 for the industry that is lower than levels during 2022 and 2021. Mortgage loan originations for the mortgage banking segment increased 21.1 percent and decreased less than 1.0 percent for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Gains on sales of loans, while driven in part by mortgage loan originations, also includes the effects of changes in locked loan commitments, which reflect the volume of mortgage loan applications that are in process and have not closed. Lock-adjusted originations for the mortgage banking segment increased 27.7 percent and 4.3 percent for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Locked loan commitments were 48.2 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 26.2 million and 40.9 million at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Mortgage loan segment originations include originations of loans sold to the community banking segment, at prices similar to those paid by third-party investors. All interest expense at the mortgage banking segment is on variable rate borrowings from the community banking segment. These transactions are eliminated to reach consolidated totals. Mortgage lender services fee income is derived from providing mortgage origination functions to third-party mortgage lenders for a fee. Mortgage lender services fee income decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to the negative impacts of reduced mortgage loan volume in the industry, partially offset by an increase in the number of institutional customers and the types of services provided. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, the mortgage banking segment recorded a reversal of provision for indemnification losses of 100,000 and 375,000, respectively, compared to a reversal of provision for indemnification losses of 200,000 and 435,000 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The mortgage banking segment increased reserves for indemnification losses during 2020 based on widespread forbearance on mortgage loans 

 49 

Table of Contents 
 and economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The release of indemnification reserves in 2024 and 2023 was due primarily to improvement in the mortgage banking segment s assessment of borrower payment performance, lower volume of mortgage loan originations in recent years and other factors affecting expected losses on mortgage loans sold in the secondary market, such as time since origination. Management believes that the indemnification reserve is sufficient to absorb losses related to loans that have been sold in the secondary market. Consumer Finance: The following table presents the consumer finance operating results for the periods indicated. TABLE 9: Consumer Finance Segment Operating Results 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest income 12,676 12,020 37,084 35,313 Interest expense 6,025 5,748 17,722 17,060 Net interest income 6,651 6,272 19,362 18,253 Provision for credit losses 3,000 1,550 8,100 4,250 Net interest income after provision for credit losses 3,651 4,722 11,262 14,003 Noninterest income 197 (19) 678 25 Noninterest expense: Salaries and employee benefits 2,007 2,389 6,188 6,840 Occupancy expense 164 160 477 475 Data processing 322 315 1,005 956 Other expenses 925 897 2,693 2,638 Total noninterest expenses 3,418 3,761 10,363 10,909 Income before income taxes 430 942 1,577 3,119 Income tax expense 119 260 435 858 Net income 311 682 1,142 2,261 The consumer finance segment reported net income of 311,000 and 1.1 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to net income of 682,000 and 2.3 million for the same periods in 2023. The decreases in consumer finance segment net income were due primarily to: higher provision for credit losses due primarily to increased net charge-offs and loan growth; and higher interest expense due primarily to increased interest rates and higher balances of borrowings; partially offset by: higher interest income resulting from the effects of higher interest rates on loan yields and higher average balances of loans; lower salaries and employee benefits expense due to an effort to reduce overhead costs; and lower loan recovery expense related to growth in loans with stronger credit quality and efficiency initiatives within the collections department. Average loan yields and average cost of borrowings were higher for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023, due primarily to the effects of the higher interest rate environment. All interest expense at the consumer finance segment is on fixed and variable rate borrowings from the community banking segment. These transactions are eliminated to reach consolidated totals. Provision for credit losses increased due primarily to increased net charge-offs and loan growth. Net charge-offs increased due primarily to an increase in the number of delinquent loans and repossessions and a higher average charge-off per unit as a result of larger loan amounts due to higher automobile values during 2020 and 2021 and a decline in wholesale values of used automobiles since then. Delinquency and loss rates have generally returned to pre-pandemic levels due to the 

 50 

Table of Contents 
 passage of time since the expiration of stimulus and enhanced unemployment benefits that benefitted borrowers. If loan performance deteriorates, resulting in further elevated delinquencies or net charge-offs, or if values of used vehicles decline, provision for credit losses may increase in future periods. ASSET QUALITY Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses The Corporation conducts an analysis of the collectability of the loan portfolio on a regular basis and uses this analysis to assess the sufficiency of the allowance for credit losses on loans and to determine the necessary provision for credit losses. The Corporation segmented the loan portfolio into three loan portfolios based on common risk characteristics. Commercial and consumer loans are assigned loan classification ratings based on their credit quality and risk of loss. These loan ratings are reviewed on a quarterly basis and updated as new information becomes available. The characteristics of these loan ratings are as follows: Pass rated loans are to persons or business entities with an acceptable financial condition, appropriate collateral margins, appropriate cash flow to service the existing loan, and an appropriate leverage ratio. The borrower has paid all obligations as agreed and it is expected that this type of payment history will continue. When necessary, acceptable personal guarantors support the loan. Special mention loans have a specific, identified weakness in the borrower s operations and in the borrower s ability to generate positive cash flow on a sustained basis. The borrower s recent payment history may be characterized by late payments. The Corporation s risk exposure is mitigated by collateral supporting the loan. The collateral is considered to be well-margined, well maintained, accessible and readily marketable. Substandard loans are considered to have specific and well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the viability of the Corporation s credit extension. The payment history for the loan has been inconsistent and the expected or projected primary repayment source may be inadequate to service the loan. The estimated net liquidation value of the collateral pledged and/or ability of the personal guarantor(s) to pay the loan may not adequately protect the Corporation. There is a distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies associated with the loan are not corrected in the near term. A substandard loan would not automatically meet the Corporation s definition of impaired unless the loan is significantly past due and the borrower s performance and financial condition provide evidence that it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due. Substandard nonaccrual loans have the same characteristics as substandard loans; however, they have a nonaccrual classification because it is probable that the Corporation will not be able to collect all amounts due. Doubtful rated loans have all the weaknesses inherent in a loan that is classified substandard but with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high. Loss rated loans are not considered collectible under normal circumstances and there is no realistic expectation for any future payment on the loan. Loss rated loans are fully charged off. The Corporation monitors the consumer finance loan portfolio by past due status and by credit rating at the time of origination, which the Corporation believes serves as a relevant indicator of aggregate credit quality and risk of loan defaults in the portfolio based upon the use of Fair Isaac Corporation FICO) Scores over time for loan approval decisions and through experience analyzing loss patterns. The characteristics of these credit ratings are as follows: 

 51 

Table of Contents 
 Very Good (>739) and Good (670-739) credit rated borrowers are near or above the average FICO Score of consumers. Borrowers generally have limited to no prior credit difficulties or have shown extensive creditworthiness over a recent period of time. Fairly Good (625-669) and Fair (580-624) credit rated borrowers are approaching or slightly below the average FICO Score of consumers but typically have a credit profile acceptable to most lenders. Borrowers may have experienced minor credit difficulties or have a relatively limited credit history. Marginal The allowance for credit losses represents an amount that, in our judgment, reduces the recorded investment in loans to the net amount expected to be collected. The provision for credit losses increases the allowance, and loans charged off, net of recoveries, reduce the allowance. The following tables present the Corporation s credit loss experience for the periods indicated. TABLE 10: Allowance for Credit Losses

The community banking segment recorded 700,000 and 1.7 million in provision for loans for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 500,000 and 1.6 million for the same periods of 2023. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses increased to 17.5 million, compared to an allowance for 

 55 

Table of Contents 
 credit losses of 16.1 million at December 31, 2023, due primarily to growth in the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans decreased to 1.22 percent at September 30, 2024 from 1.26 percent at December 31, 2023, due primarily to improvement in current and expected economic conditions, notably inflation and the prospects of a soft landing. Management believes that the level of the allowance for credit losses is adequate to reflect the net amount expected to be collected. Nonaccrual loans at the consumer finance segment were 1.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 892,000 at December 31, 2023. Nonaccrual consumer finance loans remain low relative to the allowance for credit losses and the total consumer finance loan portfolio because the consumer finance segment generally initiates repossession of loan collateral once a loan becomes more than 60 days delinquent. Repossessed vehicles of the consumer finance segment are classified as other assets and consist only of vehicles the Corporation has the legal right to sell. Prior to the reclassification from loans to repossessed vehicles, the difference between the carrying amount of each loan and the fair value of each vehicle (i.e. the deficiency) is charged against the allowance for credit losses. At September 30, 2024, repossessed vehicles available for sale totaled 522,000 compared to 646,000 at December 31, 2023. The consumer finance segment experienced net charge-offs at an annualized rate of 2.65 percent and 2.36 percent of average total loans for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 1.99 percent and 1.75 percent for the same periods of 2023, due primarily to an increase in the number of delinquent loans and repossessions and a higher average charge-off per unit as a result of larger loan amounts due to higher automobile values during 2020 and 2021 and a decline in wholesale values of used automobiles since then. Annualized net charge-offs for third quarter of 2024 increased from 1.88 percent for the second quarter of 2024 due primarily to seasonal trends within the portfolio. At September 30, 2024, total delinquent loans as a percentage of total loans was 3.49 percent compared to 4.09 percent at December 31, 2023 and 3.30 percent at September 30, 2023. Delinquency and loss rates have generally returned to pre-pandemic levels due to the passage of time since the expiration of stimulus and enhanced unemployment benefits that benefitted borrowers. The allowance for credit losses was 23.2 million at September 30, 2024 and 23.6 million at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans decreased to 4.87 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to 5.03 percent at December 31, 2023, due primarily to growth in loans with stronger credit quality while balances of loans with lower credit quality declined. The consumer finance segment at times offers payment deferrals to borrowers as a portfolio management technique to achieve higher ultimate cash collections on select loan accounts. A significant reliance on deferrals as a means of managing collections may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio. Average amounts of payment deferrals of automobile loans on a monthly basis, which are not included in delinquent loans, were 1.91 percent, 2.20 percent and 1.58 percent as a percentage of average automobile loans outstanding for the third quarter of 2024, the third quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024, respectively. Average amounts of payment deferrals of automobile loans on a monthly basis, which are not included in delinquent loans, were 1.70 percent and 1.83 percent as a percentage of average automobile loans outstanding for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The consumer finance segment is an indirect lender that provides automobile financing through lending programs that are designed to serve customers in both the prime and non-prime markets, including those who may have limited access to traditional automobile financing due to having experienced prior credit difficulties. The preferred automobile is a later model, low mileage used vehicle because the value of new vehicles typically depreciates rapidly. In addition to automobile financing, marine and RV loan contracts are also purchased on an indirect basis through a referral program administered by a third party. The marine and RV loan contracts are for prime loans averaging less than 50,000 made to individuals with higher credit scores. The consumer finance segment s focus has included non-prime borrowers and, therefore, the anticipated rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses on the consumer finance loans are higher than those experienced in the general automobile finance industry and could be more dramatically affected by changes in general economic conditions. Changes in economic conditions may also affect consumer demand for used automobiles and values of automobiles securing outstanding loans, due to changes in demand or changes in levels of inventory of used automobiles, which may directly affect the amount of a loss incurred by the consumer finance segment in the event of default. While we manage the higher risk inherent in loans made to non-prime borrowers through the underwriting criteria, portfolio management 

 56 

Table of Contents 
 and collection methods employed by the consumer finance segment, we cannot guarantee that these criteria or methods will afford adequate protection against these risks. With the consumer finance segment s use of a scorecard model for purchasing loan contracts, the credit-worthiness of borrowers at origination has improved for automobile loans purchased and the level of credit losses experienced has decreased relative to long-term historical averages. We cannot provide any assurance that the consumer finance segment s net charge-off ratio will not increase in future periods. However, we believe that the current allowance for credit losses is adequate to reflect the net amount expected to be collected on existing consumer finance segment loans that may become uncollectible. If factors influencing the consumer finance segment result in higher net charge-off ratios in future periods, the consumer finance segment may need to increase the level of its allowance for credit losses through additional provisions for credit losses, which could negatively affect future earnings of the consumer finance segment. FINANCIAL CONDITION At September 30, 2024, the Corporation had total assets of 2.6 billion, an increase of 112.4 million since December 31, 2023. The increase was attributable primarily to growth in loans held for investment and loans held for sale, funded by maturities and paydowns of available for sale securities, increases in deposits, additional borrowings, and deployment of cash on hand. The significant components of the Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheets are discussed below. Loan Portfolio Tables 16, 17 and 18 present information pertaining to the composition of loans held for investment, the composition of commercial real estate loans, and the maturity/repricing of certain loans held for investment, respectively.

 Securities The investment portfolio plays a primary role in the management of the Corporation s interest rate sensitivity. In addition, the portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and is used as needed to meet collateral requirements. The investment portfolio consists of securities available for sale, which may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, general liquidity needs and other similar factors. These securities are carried at estimated fair value. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all securities in the Corporation s investment portfolio were classified as available for sale. The following table sets forth the composition of the Corporation s securities available for sale in dollar amounts at fair value and as a percentage of the Corporation s total securities available for sale at the dates indicated.

Net unrealized losses in the market value of securities available for sale decreased to 21.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 31.6 million at December 31, 2023. For more information about the Corporation s securities available for sale, including information about securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, see Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements under the heading Note 2: Securities in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following table presents additional information pertaining to the composition of the securities portfolio at amortized cost, by the earlier of contractual maturity or expected maturity. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. The total effective duration of the investment portfolio is 4.1 years as of September 30, 2024.

 1. Yields on tax-exempt securities have been computed on a taxable-equivalent basis using the federal corporate income tax rate of 21 percent. The weighted average yield is calculated based on the relative amortized costs of the securities. Deposits The Corporation s predominant source of funds is depository accounts, which are comprised of demand deposits, savings and money market accounts and time deposits. The Corporation s deposits are principally provided by individuals and businesses located within the communities served. During the first nine months of 2024, deposits increased 69.8 million to 2.14 billion at September 30, 2024. Noninterest bearing demand deposits decreased 7.7 million, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits decreased 60.1 million, and time deposits increased 137.6 million during the same period. The decrease in non-time deposits was due in part to a shift in balances toward time deposits amid a higher interest rate environment and to seasonal factors related to municipal deposits, which tend to increase with tax collections primarily in the fourth quarter of each year and decline with spending thereafter. The Corporation had 122.9 million in municipal deposits at September 30, 2024 compared to 167.9 million at December 31, 2023.

 The Corporation had 25.0 million in brokered money market and time deposits outstanding at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Corporation may continue to use brokered deposits on a limited basis as a means of maintaining and diversifying liquidity and funding sources. Borrowings Borrowings increased to 142.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 109.5 million at December 31, 2023 due primarily to increased borrowings from the FHLB to support lending activities. Liquidity The objective of the Corporation s liquidity management is to ensure the continuous availability of funds to satisfy the credit needs of our customers and the demands of our depositors, creditors and investors. Stable core deposits and a strong capital position are the components of a solid foundation for the Corporation s liquidity position. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Corporation include cash flows from operations, loan payments and payoffs, deposit growth, maturities, calls and sales of securities, the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and the capacity to borrow additional funds. Liquid assets, which include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits at other banks and nonpledged securities available for sale, totaled 287.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 338.8 million at December 31, 2023. The Corporation s funding sources, including capacity, amount outstanding and amount available at September 30, 2024 are presented in Table 21. The Corporation s capacity and amount available increased 66.2 million and 33.7 million, respectively, from December 31, 2023 as a result of pledging additional loans in order to increase funding capacity under secured funding arrangements with the FRB and FHLB.

 1. Amounts include 20.0 million and 35.0 million of certain unsecured federal funds agreements and repurchase lines of credit, respectively, at December 31, 2023 that subsequently terminated in January 2024 when the corresponding third-party ended all federal funds agreements and repurchase lines of credit with all financial institutions. We have no reason to believe these arrangements will not be renewed at maturity. Additional loans and securities are available that can be pledged as collateral for future borrowings from the FHLB and FRB above the current lendable collateral value. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, including economic conditions nationally and in our markets. Depending on our liquidity levels, our capital position, conditions in the capital markets, our business operations and initiatives, and other factors, we may from time to time consider the issuance of debt, equity or other securities or other possible capital market transactions, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations.

 Uninsured deposits represent an estimate of amounts above the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance coverage limit of 250,000. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation s uninsured deposits were approximately 607.6 million, or 28.5 percent of total deposits. Excluding intercompany cash holdings and municipal deposits which are secured with pledged securities, amounts uninsured were approximately 455.6 million, or 21.3 percent of total deposits as of September 30, 2024, compared to 404.1 million, or 19.6 percent of total deposits as of December 31, 2023. The Corporation s liquid assets and borrowing availability as of September 30, 2024 totaled 871.2 million, exceeding uninsured deposits, excluding intercompany cash holdings and secured municipal deposits, by 415.6 million. The Corporation s internal policy limits brokered deposits to 20 percent of total deposits, representing approximately 402.1 million of additional net availability for additional brokered deposits as of September 30, 2024. As a result of the Corporation s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding, management believes that the Corporation maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its operational requirements and contractual obligations. Capital Resources The assessment of capital adequacy depends on such factors as asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance, and changing competitive conditions and economic forces. We regularly review the adequacy of the Corporation s and the Bank s capital. We maintain a structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses. While we will continue to look for opportunities to invest capital in profitable growth, share repurchases are another tool that facilitates improving shareholder return, as measured by ROE and earnings per share. The disclosure below presents the Corporation s and the Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios under currently applicable regulatory capital standards. Under the small bank holding company policy statement of the Federal Reserve Board, which applies to certain bank holding companies with consolidated total assets of less than 3 billion, the Corporation is not subject to regulatory capital requirements. The table below reflects the Corporation s consolidated capital as determined under regulations that apply to bank holding companies that are not small bank holding companies and minimum capital requirements that would apply to the Corporation if it were not a small bank holding company. Although the minimum regulatory capital requirements are not applicable to the Corporation, the Corporation calculates these ratios for its own planning and monitoring purposes. Total risk-weighted assets at September 30, 2024 for the Corporation were 2.13 billion and for the Bank were 2.11 billion. Total risk-weighted assets at December 31, 2023 for the Corporation were 1.95 billion and for the Bank were 1.92 billion. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. TABLE 22: Regulatory Capital

The Total Capital ratio, Tier 1 Capital ratio and CET1 ratio are calculated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio is calculated as a percentage of average tangible assets. The decrease in these ratios at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was due primarily to growth in risk-weighted assets resulting from higher balances of loans outpacing growth in equity. In addition, the Corporation has made the one-time irrevocable election to continue treating accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) under regulatory standards that were in place prior to the Basel III Final Rule in order to eliminate volatility of regulatory capital that can result from fluctuations in AOCI and the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, as would otherwise be required under the Basel III Capital Rule. As a result of this election, changes in AOCI, including unrealized losses on securities available for sale, do not affect regulatory capital amounts shown in the table above for the Corporation or the Bank. For additional information about the Basel III Final Rules, see Item 1. Business under the heading Regulation and Supervision and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under the heading Note 17: Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Basel III rules established a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios, which is not included in the table above. Including the capital conservation buffer, the minimum ratios are a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5 percent, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5 percent. The Corporation and the Bank exceeded these ratios at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Corporation s capital resources are impacted by its share repurchase programs. The Board of Directors authorized a program, effective January 1, 2024, to repurchase up to 10.00 million of the Corporation s common stock through December 31, 2024 (the 2024 Repurchase Program). Repurchases under the 2024 Repurchase Program may be made through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, including pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and/or Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (Exchange Act) and shares repurchased will be returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of common stock. The timing, number and purchase price of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by management in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the shares, general market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other conditions, and there is no assurance that the Corporation will purchase any shares under the 2024 Repurchase Program. The 2024 Repurchase Program is authorized through December 31, 2024, and, as of September 30, 2024, there was 2.7 million remaining available for repurchases of the Corporation s common stock under the 2024 Repurchase Program.

 USE OF CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to GAAP in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP measures are used by management to supplement the evaluation of the Corporation s performance. These include net tangible income attributable to the Corporation, ROTCE, tangible book value per share, and the following fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) measures: interest income on loans-FTE, interest income on securities-FTE, total interest income-FTE and net interest income-FTE. Interest on tax-exempt loans and securities is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis (which converts the income on loans and investments for which no income taxes are paid to the equivalent yield as if income taxes were paid) using the federal corporate income tax rate of 21 percent that was applicable for all periods presented. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures provides meaningful information about operating performance by enhancing comparability with other financial periods, other financial institutions, and between different sources of interest income. The non-GAAP measures used by management enhance comparability by excluding the effects of balances of intangible assets, including goodwill, that vary significantly between institutions, and tax benefits that are not consistent across different opportunities for investment. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP-basis financial statements, and other bank holding companies may define or calculate these or similar measures differently. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation to evaluate and measure the Corporation s performance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is presented below.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Corporation s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates will affect the amount of interest income and expense the Corporation receives or pays on a significant portion of its assets and liabilities and the market value of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, excluding those which have a very short term until maturity. The Corporation does not subject itself to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk due to the current nature of its operations. The Corporation has established a comprehensive enterprise risk management program to monitor risks related to its operations, including market risk, and the Corporation s Chief Risk Officer has primary responsibility for the enterprise risk management program. The Corporation s Asset/Liability Committee meets at least quarterly with the primary objective of maximizing current and future net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate risk while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements. Management recognizes that a certain amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate. Thus the goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a balance between risk and reward such that net interest income is maximized while risk is maintained at an acceptable level. The objective of the Corporation s liquidity management is to meet the Corporation s liquidity requirements by ensuring the continuous availability of funds to satisfy the credit needs of our customers and the demands of our depositors, creditors and investors. Stable core deposits and a strong capital position are the components of a solid foundation for the Corporation s liquidity position. Management continuously monitors cash flows, including deposit flows, loan fundings and draws, securities payments and borrowing maturities, and the impact of changes in interest rates on these cash flows. Additionally, management tracks uninsured deposits, unpledged securities and unpledged loans among other liquidity metrics. The Corporation assumes interest rate risk in the normal course of operations. The fair values of most of the Corporation s financial instruments will change when interest rates change and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Corporation. Management attempts to match maturities and repricing dates of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to balance minimizing interest rate risk and increasing net interest income in current market conditions. However, borrowers with fixed rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment. Conversely, depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment. Management monitors rates, maturities and repricing dates of assets and liabilities and attempts to manage interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans, deposits and borrowings, by investing in securities with terms that manage the Corporation s overall interest rate risk, and in some cases by using derivative contracts to reduce the Corporation s overall exposure to changes in interest rates. The Corporation does not enter into interest rate-sensitive instruments for trading purposes. We use simulation analysis to assess earnings at risk and economic value of equity (EVE) analysis to assess economic value at risk. These methods allow management to regularly monitor both the direction and magnitude of the Corporation s interest rate risk exposure. These modeling techniques involve assumptions and estimates that inherently cannot be measured with complete precision. Key assumptions in the analyses include maturity and repricing characteristics of both assets and liabilities, prepayments on amortizing assets, other embedded options, non-maturity deposit sensitivity and loan and deposit pricing. These assumptions are inherently uncertain due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and provide a relative gauge of the Corporation s interest rate risk position over time. Simulation analysis evaluates the potential effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income. The analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months. The resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of the Corporation s shorter-term interest rate risk. The analysis utilizes a static balance sheet approach, which assumes changes in interest rates without any management response to change the composition of the balance sheet. The measurement date balance sheet composition is maintained over the simulation time period with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates. Additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under the various rate scenarios. These assumptions include loan prepayments, time deposit early withdrawals, the sensitivity of deposit repricing to changes in market rates, withdrawal behavior of non-maturing deposits, and other factors that management deems significant.

 The simulation analysis results, based on a measurement date balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, for hypothetical changes in net interest income over the next twelve months are presented in the table below. One-Year Net Interest Income Simulation (dollars in thousands) 

Hypothetical Change in Net Interest Income Over the Next Twelve Months as of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Assumed Market Interest Rate Shift Dollars Percentage Dollars Percentage -300 BP shock (8,709) (7.86) (8,372) (8.22) -200 BP shock (5,619) (5.07) (5,137) (5.04) -100 BP shock (2,585) (2.33) (2,352) (2.31) +100 BP shock 677 0.61 1,081 1.06 +200 BP shock 1,132 1.02 2,094 2.06 +300 BP shock 1,474 1.33 3,013 2.96 These results indicate that the Corporation would expect net interest income to decrease over the next twelve months assuming an immediate downward shift in market interest rates of 100 BP to 300 BP and to increase if rates shifted upward to the same degree. The simulation analysis results show the Corporation s sensitivity to an upward shift in rates relative to a downward shift in rates was less pronounced as of September 30, 2024 compared to the results as of December 31, 2023 due primarily to shifts in the mix of deposits and borrowings. The EVE analysis provides information on the risk inherent in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the simulation analysis due to the shorter time horizon used in that analysis. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of expected asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of the expected liability cash flows. The analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining the expected cash flows and in discounting the cash flows. The resulting percentage change in net present value in various rate scenarios is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet. The EVE analysis results are presented in the table below. Static EVE Change (dollars in thousands) 

Hypothetical Change in EVE as of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Assumed Market Interest Rate Shift Dollars Percentage Dollars Percentage -300 BP shock (42,604) (10.87) (28,719) (7.51) -200 BP shock (19,787) (5.05) (10,881) (2.85) -100 BP shock (5,431) (1.39) (1,397) (0.37) +100 BP shock (2,951) (0.75) (1,945) (0.51) +200 BP shock (8,688) (2.22) (5,012) (1.31) +300 BP shock (15,851) (4.05) (11,062) (2.89) These results as of September 30, 2024 indicate that the EVE would decrease assuming an immediate downward shift in market interest rates of 100 BP to 300 BP, and would decrease assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of 100 BP to 300 BP. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation s EVE is more sensitive to changes in rates compared to its position as of December 31, 2023 due primarily to shifts in the mix of earning assets and in the mix of deposits and borrowings, which impacted the overall duration of both assets and liabilities. The lower interest rate environment as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 increased the prepayment expectations of certain earning assets, which also contributed to the Corporation s EVE sensitivity to changes in rates. Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk analyses. Modeling changes in forecasted cash flows and EVE requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which

 actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates, and certain assumed scenarios may be impractical to model under different economic circumstances. In a falling rate environment, the analyses assume that rate-sensitive assets are repriced downward, subject to floors on certain loans, while certain deposit rates are not allowed to decrease below zero. The Corporation uses interest rate swaps to manage select exposures to interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on a common notional principal amount and maturity date with no exchange of underlying principal amounts. The Corporation has interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges. The cash flow hedges effectively modify the Corporation s exposure to interest rate risk associated with the Corporation s trust preferred capital notes by converting variable rates of interest on the trust preferred capital notes to fixed rates of interest for periods ending between June 2026 and June 2029. Also, as part of the Corporation s overall strategy for maximizing net interest income while managing interest rate risk, the Corporation enters into interest rate swaps in connection with originating loans to certain commercial borrowers as a means to offer a fixed-rate instrument to the borrower while effectively retaining a variable-rate exposure. The mortgage banking segment enters into IRLCs with customers to originate loans for which the interest rates are determined prior to funding. The mortgage banking segment then mitigates interest rate risk on these IRLCs and loans held for sale by entering into forward sales contracts with investors at the time that interest rates are locked for loans to be delivered on a best efforts basis. IRLCs are derivative financial instruments. We believe that our current interest rate exposure is manageable and does not indicate any significant exposure to interest rate changes. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Corporation s management, including the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Corporation s management, including the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover every situation involving the failure of persons within the Corporation or its subsidiary to disclose material information required to be set forth in the Corporation s periodic reports. There were no changes in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATI O N ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes in the risk factors faced by the Corporation from those disclosed in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
