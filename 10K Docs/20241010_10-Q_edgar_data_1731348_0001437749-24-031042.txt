 On August 31, 2021, the Company issued shares valued at to acquire interest in Superhero Acquisition L.P. SH Acquisition ), which purchased a senior secured convertible note issued by MedMen (the "MedMen Convertible Note"), together with certain associated warrants to acquire Class B subordinate voting shares of MedMen, in the principal amount of . The MedMen Convertible Note bears interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus , with a SOFR floor of with any accrued interest being added to the outstanding principal amount. The outstanding principal amount, together with accrued interest is to be paid on August 17, 2028, the maturity date of the MedMen Convertible Note. SH Acquisition was also granted top-up rights enabling it (and its limited partners) to maintain its percentage ownership (on an as-converted basis) in the event that MedMen issues equity securities. SH Acquisition s ability to convert the MedMen Convertible Note and exercise the Warrants is dependent upon U.S. federal legalization of cannabis or Tilray s waiver of such requirement as well as any additional regulatory approvals. 
 
 During the year ended May 31, 2024, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary change in fair value, which resulted in a non-cash expense of . The MedMen Convertible Note was valued based upon the fair value of the collateral assets net of disposal costs and has been reduced to reflect recent events, including the appointment of a chief restructuring officer on January 23, 2024 to facilitate MedMen s anticipated recapitalization and restructuring of operations, filing for insolvency protection in Canada and in California and pending asset sales. There are no additional changes in fair value for the three months ended August 31, 2024 . 
 
 The Company did not derive any revenue or cash from MedMen's operations, and fully complies with all limitations imposed by applicable U.S. law and regulations in connection with its ownership of the MedMen Convertible Note. In addition, since the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, the Company has not recognized any interest income on the MedMen Convertible Note, nor did the Company recognize any interest income for the three months ended August 31, 2024 , which would have increased its value.

The TLRY 27 Notes bear interest at a rate of per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, and mature on June 15, 2027, unless earlier converted. The TLRY 27 Notes are Tilray s general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of Tilray s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes; equal in right of payment with any of Tilray s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated, including TLRY 23 and APHA 24, effectively junior in right of payment to any of Tilray s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables but excluding intercompany obligations) of Tilray s current or future subsidiaries. Noteholders will have the right to convert their TLRY 27 Notes into shares of Tilray s common stock at their option, at any time, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before June 15, 2027. The initial conversion rate is shares per principal amount of TLRY 27 Notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately per share. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. 
 
 The TLRY 27 Notes will be redeemable, in whole and not in part, at Tilray s option at any time on or after June 20, 2025 at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price of Tilray s common stock exceeds of the conversion price for a specified period of time. If certain corporate events that constitute a fundamental change occur, then, subject to a limited exception, noteholders may require Tilray to repurchase their TLRY 27 Notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. In connection with the Company s offering of the TLRY 27 Notes, the Company entered into a share lending agreement with an affiliate of Jefferies LLC (the Share Borrower ), pursuant to which it lent to the Share Borrower shares of the Company s common stock (the "Borrowed Shares"). The Borrowed Shares were newly-issued shares, will be held as treasury shares until the expiration or early termination of the share lending agreement and may be used by purchasers of the TLRY 27 Notes to sell up to shares of the Company s common stock. The fair value of the share lending agreement has been recorded as part of the unamortized discount on the debenture. The Company expects that the selling stockholders will use their position created by such sales to establish their initial hedge with respect to their investments in the TLRY 27 Notes. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Borrowed Shares. See Note 27 (Subsequent Events), which discloses the repurchase of of TLRY 27 Notes in an exchange transaction.

 The warrants contain anti-dilution price protection features, which adjust the exercise price of the warrants if the Company subsequently issues common stock at a price lower than the exercise price of the warrants. In the event additional warrants or convertible debt are issued with a lower and/or variable exercise price, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted accordingly. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024 , the Company issued shares which triggered the anti-dilution price protection feature lowering the exercise price to . These warrants are classified as liabilities as they are to be settled in registered shares, and the registration statement is required to be active, unless such shares may be subject to an applicable exemption from registration requirements. The holders, at their sole discretion, may elect to affect a cashless exercise, and be issued exempt securities in accordance with Section 3 (a)( 9 of the 1933 Act. In the event the Company does not maintain an effective registration statement, the Company may be required to pay a daily cash penalty equal to of the number of shares of common stock due to be issued multiplied by any trading price of the common stock between the exercise date and the share delivery date, as selected by the holder. Alternatively, the Company may deliver registered common stock purchased by the Company in the open market. The Company may also be required to pay cash if it does not have sufficient authorized shares to deliver to the holders upon exercise. 
 
 The Company estimated the fair value of warrants outstanding as of August 31, 2024 at per warrant using the Black Scholes pricing model (Level 3 with the following assumptions: Risk-free interest rate of , expected volatility of , expected term of years, strike price of and fair value of common stock of .

Legal proceedings 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are at times subject to various legal proceedings and disputes, including the proceedings specifically discussed below. We assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. Where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of loss is not estimable, we do not accrue legal reserves. While the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available and available insurance coverage, our management believes that it has established appropriate legal reserves. Any incremental liabilities arising from pending legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows. 
 
 There have been no material changes from the legal proceedings since our Annual Report on Form 10 -K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 , except with respect to the legal proceeding disclosed below that was dismissed with prejudice on September 30, 2024: 
 
 Authentic Brands Group Related Class Action (New York, United States)

The complaint alleges that Tilray and the individual defendants overstated the anticipated advantages of the Company s revenue sharing agreement with Authentic Brands Group ABG ), announced on January 15, 2019, and that the plaintiff suffered losses when Tilray s stock price dropped after Tilray recognized an impairment with respect to the ABG deal on March 2, 2020. 
 
 On September 27, 2021, the U.S. District Court entered an Opinion Order granting the Defendants motion to dismiss the complaint in the Kasilingam litigation without prejudice. On December 3, 2021, the lead plaintiff filed a second amended complaint alleging similar claims against Tilray and Brendan Kennedy. The Defendants successfully moved to dismiss the second amended complaint on February 2, 2022. In dismissing the second amended complaint, the court granted the Plaintiff leave to amend one final time. On September 27, 2023, the Plaintiff filed its Third Amended Complaint.

 In the Matter of an Arbitration Between: K. Dickson v. Tilray, Inc. 
 
 In 2021, Ms. Dickson, the former President of Manitoba Harvest, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tilray, commenced an arbitration in Minneapolis, Minnesota against Tilray, alleging that Tilray materially breached her Employment Agreement with Tilray and asserted certain Washington statutory wage claims. 
 
 On March 17, 2023, the arbitrator awarded Dickson in damages, plus amounts for pre-judgment, and double damages under a Washington state wage payment statute (the Arbitration Award ). Tilray s counterclaim was denied by the Arbitrator. On May 23, 2023, the arbitrator issued a supplemental award which provided that Dickson was entitled to recover attorney fees and costs from Tilray in connection with the arbitration. On February 27, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington dismissed as moot Tilray s petition to vacate, modify or correct the Arbitration Award, granting Dickson s responding motion to dismiss on the basis that the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington lacked personal jurisdiction over Dickson. On March 15, 2024, Tilray filed its notice of appeal of the decision of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On August 8, 2024, the District Court in Minnesota confirmed the Arbitration Award. A judgment on the Award was entered by the Court on August 12, 2024, and, following a motion to correct the judgment, became final on September 27, 2024. Tilray filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which appeal is still pending. The parties are finalizing a settlement of this matter, pursuant to which Tilray intends to pay the amount of the Arbitration Award in satisfaction of the related judgment.

The Company s long-term debt is valued based on discounting the future cash outflows associated with the long-term debt. The discount rate is based on the incremental premium above market rates for the U.S. Department of the Treasury securities of similar duration. In each period thereafter, the incremental premium is held constant while the U.S. Department of the Treasury security is based on the then current market value to derive the discount rate. 

The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilized to determine such fair value:

The Company s financial assets and liabilities required to be measured on a recurring basis are its convertible notes receivable, equity investments measured at fair value, convertible debentures measured at fair value, acquisition-related contingent consideration, and warrant liability. 
 
 Convertible notes receivable and long-term investments are recorded at fair value. The estimated fair value is determined using, among others, the Black Scholes option pricing model, probability of legalization and is classified as Level 3. 
 
 Convertible debentures payable are recorded at fair value when elected or required under US GAAP. Specifically, the APHA 24 instrument's estimated fair value was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and was classified as Level 3. 
 
 Certain equity investments recorded at fair value have quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and are classified as Level 1. The Company classified securities with observable inputs as Level 2 and without a quoted market price as Level 3. 
 
 The warrants associated with the warrant liability are classified as Level 3 derivatives. Consequently, the estimated fair value of the warrant liability is determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Until the warrants are exercised, expire, or other facts and circumstances lead the warrant liability to be reclassified to stockholders equity, the warrant liability (which relates to warrants to purchase shares of common stock) is marked-to-market each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in change in fair value of warrant liability. Any significant adjustments to the unobservable inputs disclosed in the table below would have a direct impact on the fair value of the warrant liability. 
 
 A portion of the consideration to be paid in connection the Company s acquisition of Montauk Brewing is contingent upon the achievement of certain financial measures as of December 2025, and if achieved, such contingent consideration is payable in cash. The contingent consideration amount was estimated by applying a probability of achievement of on the sales earn-out component and on the remaining criterion, which is not expected to be achieved. The unobservable inputs into the future expected cash outflows result in a fair value measurement classified as Level 3. 
 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, a decrease in fair value of nil was recognized compared to a decrease of fair value of in the period ended August 31, 2023 for the contingent consideration from the SweetWater acquisition as a result of not achieving the incentive targets.

 Contingent consideration Discounted cash flows Discount rate, 
 Probability of achievement 100 and 0 

Items measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis 
 
 The Company's prepaids and other current assets, long lived assets, including property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets are measured at fair value when there is an indicator of impairment and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. 
 
 Management reviews its capital management approach on an ongoing basis and believes that this approach, given the relative size of the Company, is reasonable. There have been no changes to the Company s capital management approach in the period. The Company considers its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as capital.

Trends and Other Factors Affecting Our Business 
 
 Beverage alcohol market trends: 
 
 The U.S. beverage alcohol category is approximately a 180 billion category per AKI Technologies encompassing beer, wine, and spirits and continues to maintain annual growth of 2 amid shifting consumer trends, especially within the craft industry. Several key trends we expect to shape the near-term outlook in this segment, which primarily are in two main categories: beer and spirits: 

- 
 Beverage Alcohol Distribution . In furtherance of our strategic vision, we have reevaluated and initiated a refined craft beer strategy focused on enhancing our relevance within home markets on mission critical items. Through targeted efforts, we've bolstered our distribution footprint, gaining critical distribution on priority product offerings including, but not limited to, SweetWater 420, Montauk Wave Chaser and Seasonals, Shock Top Seasonals, and Ten Barrel Pub Beer, and Redhook Big Ballard IPA. This expansion has notably increased product availability, enabling us to effectively engage with a broader yet more targeted consumer base and drive sales growth. 

- 
 Market share . Despite continued challenges in the industry marked by a (4.7 decline in the US Craft beer industry in our first quarter according to Circana, the Company s beer category has showcased resilience in our home markets. While our national performance aligned closely with that of the industry, our emphasis on regional market penetration yielded promising results. Notably, our brands demonstrated strong performance in their respective regional strongholds, showcasing market share gains with Redhook product gains across the Pacific Northwest, Ten Barrel products gaining on the West Coast, SweetWater 420 gaining share in Florida, and Montauk Wave Chaser IPA continuing to gain share in New York. 

- 
 Innovation . Recognizing the evolving consumer landscape and the burgeoning demand for alternative beverage options, we have prioritized innovation and portfolio diversification. Our recent endeavors include expanding into Non-Alcoholic beverages, water through our Liquid Love brand, flavored malt beverages, and Energy drinks. These strategic innovations underscore our commitment to offering high-quality options across diverse beverage categories, positioning us for sustained growth and differentiation in the competitive beverage alcohol segment. 

- 
 Brew Pubs . Following our recent Craft Acquisition on September 29, 2023, we operate 20 brew pubs including our Breckenridge Distillery restaurant in geographic regions across the U.S. that are in close proximity to the production of our craft brands. An important part of our strategic plan for our beverage alcohol operations centers on Brew Pubs to promote and showcase the distinct, regional positioning of our craft beer brands and enhance brand recognition to help drive revenue growth. We believe that our brew pub strategy allows us to curate unique small batch product offerings in targeted test markets to help drive effective product innovation. 

In the spirits category, Breckenridge Distillery stands out as a beacon within the bourbon industry, making notable strides in vodka and gin markets while offering a comprehensive hospitality experience through its world-class restaurant and retail location. Our primary growth objective centers on expanding market share across the United States. To fuel future expansion, we prioritize showcasing our exceptional product quality and introducing innovative new offerings. Recent accolades, including Double Gold awards at prestigious competitions such as Port Cask Finish being named World s best finished Bourbon at the 2024 World Whiskies Awards and strategic product placements, we believe underscore our brand's growing recognition and appeal. Despite prevailing challenges within the overall spirits market, our focus on whiskey a resilient segment we believe positions us for continued growth fueled by innovative product introductions and expanded market presence. 
 
 Canadian cannabis market trends: 

The cannabis industry in Canada continues to evolve given how nascent the industry is with federal legalization of adult-use cannabis occurring just over five years ago. Through analysis of the current market conditions, the following key trends have emerged and are anticipated to influence the near-term future in the Canadian cannabis industry: 

- 
 Market share . Tilray continues to maintain its market leadership position in Canada. However, during the quarter, we experienced a marginal dip in market share in Canada from 10.4 to 9.8 from the immediately preceding quarter, as reported by Hifyre data for all provinces excluding Quebec where Weedcrawler was deemed more accurate. The current period decrease in market share reflects our efforts to preserve margin despite continued price compression that our competitors are perpetuating. 

- 
 Price compression. Historical price compression is expected to persist in the market, intensified by fierce competition among the approximately 1,000 Licensed Producers in Canada. The fixed impact of excise per gram, notwithstanding the decline in average selling prices, further compounds these challenges, prompting ongoing industry lobbying efforts. 

Current developments related to the Excise Tax Act: 
 
 It has recently been reported that Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has taken steps to garnish payments due to Canadian Licensed Producers (LPs), who have failed to pay their Excise Tax in full in a timely manner. The reported garnishments by CRA were quickly followed by LPs filing for insolvency protection. We view CRA's proactiveness on account collection as a positive step towards the consolidation of the Canadian cannabis industry. This proactiveness in creating cash flow pressure for those LPs that were behind on Excise Taxes increases the risk of future insolvencies in the LP market. As at the date of this filing we are current with CRA on Excise Taxes owed by all of our Canadian entities that are required to pay Excise Taxes. 
 
 International cannabis market updates: 
 
 The cannabis industry in Europe is in its early stages of development whereby countries within Europe are at different stages of legalization of medical and adult-use cannabis as some countries have expressed a clear political ambition to legalize adult-use cannabis (Germany, Portugal, Luxembourg and Czech Republic), some are engaging in an experiment for adult-use (Germany, Netherlands and Switzerland) and some are debating regulations for cannabinoid-based medicine (France and Spain). In Europe, we believe that, despite continuing recessionary economic conditions and the Russian conflict with Ukraine, cannabis legalization (both medicinal and adult-use) will continue to gain traction albeit more slowly than originally expected. This is evidenced by the recently adopted cannabis regulations in Germany, which we believe will serve as a catalyst for continued changes in drug policy throughout Europe. We also continue to believe that Tilray remains uniquely positioned to maintain and gain significant market share in these markets with our vertically-integrated infrastructure and well-placed investments, which is comprised of two EU-GMP cultivation facilities within Europe located in Portugal and Germany, our distribution network and our demonstrated commitment and expertise related to the availability, quality and safety of our cannabinoid-based medical products. 
 
 The following is a summary of the state of cannabis legalization within Europe: 
 
 Germany . Today, Germany remains the largest medical cannabis market in Europe. 
 
 Subsequent to the end of our third quarter, the Cannabis Act, consisting of two parts, the CanG and MedCanG, passed both chambers of the German parliament, was signed into law by the Office of the Federal President and decriminalization and MedCanG portions of the Cannabis Act became effective on April 1, 2024. The licensing process for the cannabis social clubs commenced on July 1, 2024 and is expected to provide first legal supply of adult-use cannabis outside of home-growing between November and January 2025. As of October 1, 2024, 16 licenses were issued out of 315 applications. 
 
 The MedCanG provides for several important medical cannabis reforms including the abolishment of the tender for domestic production, which has been replaced with a regular licensing scheme under the authority of the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (the BfArM as well as for the reclassification of medical cannabis from a narcotic to non-narcotic, with Tilray receiving the first one. Three licenses for domestic cultivation have been issued, of which Tilray holds one. The foreseen enhanced accessibility to medical cannabis due to non-narcotic prescriptions has had the desired effect. The prescription numbers have risen since April 1, 2024. 
 
 Due to the short remainder of the legislative term until September 2025, we expect a regulatory solution for the framework of the Pillar Two Regulations model projects via two administrative ordinances. One of which the draft version is known is to be transferred from the Ministry of Health into the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. A second one will likely define the framework of the model projects. Both are expected after the parliamentary approval of the federal budget in late November 2024. 
 
 We continue to believe that Tilray is well-positioned in Germany, especially considering the enactment of MedCanG and given that we are one of only three manufacturers of medical cannabis in Germany as our wholly owned subsidiary, Aphria RX, was awarded the first license for the cultivation of medical cannabis in Germany by the BfArM under the liberalized regime. Said license will improve our ability to meet the needs of patients and provide cannabis of the utmost quality and enhanced availability to a broader market. 
 
 Switzerland. In October 2021, Switzerland announced its intention to legalize cannabis by allowing production, cultivation, trade, and consumption, and in the meantime, it is commencing pilot projects in various cities, which permits selected participants to purchase cannabis for adult-use in various pharmacies in order to conduct studies on the cannabis market and its impact on Swiss society. It is the first trial for the legal distribution of adult-use cannabis containing THC in Europe. Switzerland is currently running trials in the cities of Lausanne, Z rich, Liestal, Allschwil, Bern, Bienne, and Lucerne, along with the cantons of Basel-Stadt and Geneva. A new pilot study in the district of canton Z rich has commenced, making it four model projects in total. 
 
 Spain. In February 2024, Spain s Ministry of Health announced that it had started the process to develop a Royal Decree with which it plans to approve the regulation of medical cannabis. In addition, it launched a public consultation on its proposals for a medical cannabis framework in the country and provided organizations and individual with the opportunity to submit their comments. This process is ongoing. 
 
 France . France launched a two-year pilot experiment to supply approximately 3,000 patients with medical cannabis. To date, over 2,500 patients are enrolled in the experiment, which has been extended for another year and was targeted to end March 2024. Patients who have taken part in the pilot before March 27, 2024, can continue their treatment as previously, but no new patients will be allowed to join the pilot. In October 2023, the government proposed an amendment to the Social Security Financing Bill (PLFSS) adding medical cannabis law to France's general medical framework. Under the new proposals, medical cannabis products will be granted a "temporary authorization" for five years, with a possibility of indefinite renewals. In addition, the French National Medicines Safety Agency (ANSM) recently confirmed that cannabis flower will not be included in its generalized medical marijuana program. 
 
 Czech Republic. The Czech Republic has discussed plans to launch a fully regulated adult-use cannabis market. It is understood that there are two separate versions of a bill to legalize adult-use cannabis, one with a fully regulated commercial market and one without. These are expected to be submitted to the Czech government to determine which model it will pursue. 
 
 Malta . In 2021, became the first country in the European Union to legalize personal possession of the drug and permit private cannabis clubs, where members can grow and share the drug. 
 
 Netherlands. The Netherlands launched a pilot program involving the cultivation of cannabis for adult-use. The purpose of the experiment is to determine whether and how controlled cannabis can be legally supplied to coffeeshops and what the effects of this would be. During the experiment, legally produced cannabis will be sold in coffeeshops in 10 municipalities. Coffeeshops in these municipalities may only sell legally produced cannabis. The term of the experiment is set for four years. On March 5, 2024, the Tweede Kamer, the lower house of Parliament, rejected the bill that aimed to include Amsterdam in the pilot project. 
 
 Ukraine. In February 2024, President Zelensky signed the legislation permitting the prescription of cannabis-based medicines for conditions including pain, cancer and PTSD. The distribution of cannabis for recreational purposes is still prohibited, and the government will strictly control the sale and distribution of medical cannabis. Only patients with a prescription from a doctor are able to buy the drug legally, mainly related to the indication of PTSD.

 Manitoba Harvest s US branded business grew 5.2 in Multi-Outlet consumption during the three months ended August 31, 2024 from the prior year period, further establishing its leading market share position with the brand s top five customers all seeing growth. The Company continues to focus on value-added innovation within the wellness space with the acquisition of The Humble Seed, a seed-forward cracker company with snacking distribution in key US retailers, along with the launch of two new flavors of BioActive Fiber within the current quarter. 
 
 Acquisitions, Strategic Transactions and Synergies 
 
 We strive to continue to expand our business on a consolidated basis, through a combination of organic growth and acquisition. While we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives that we believe will result in the long-term, sustainable growth and value to our stockholders, we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions of businesses that we believe complement our existing portfolio, infrastructure and capabilities or provide us with the opportunity to enter attractive new geographic markets and product categories as well as expand our existing capabilities. In addition, we have exited certain businesses and continue to evaluate certain businesses within our portfolio that are dilutive to profitability and cash flow. As a result, we incur transaction costs in connection with identifying and completing acquisitions and strategic transactions, as well as ongoing integration and restructuring costs as we combine acquired companies and continue to achieve synergies, which is offset by income generated in connection with the execution of these transactions. For the three months ended August 31, 2024, we incurred 1.2 million of transaction expenses, discussed further below. 
 
 Effective September 1, 2024, Tilray acquired a portfolio of four craft brands and breweries comprised of Atwater Brewery, Hop Valley Brewing Company, Terrapin Beer Co., and Revolver Brewing from Molson, see Note 27 (Subsequent Events). We expect that this recent acquisition furthers the execution of our beverage strategy and will have positive impacts on our beverage segment leading to increased revenues and whitespace penetration.

Political and Economic Environment 
 
 Our results of operations may be affected by economic, political, legislative, regulatory, legal actions, the global volatility and general market disruption resulting from geopolitical tensions, such as Russia's incursion into Ukraine and the ongoing events in the Middle East. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, supply chain disruptions, interest and monetary exchange rates, and government fiscal policies, and the recent banking credit crises can have a significant effect on operations. Accordingly, we could be affected by civil, criminal, environmental, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Our consolidated results, in thousands except for per share data, are as follows:

Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including reference to: 

adjusted gross profit (excluding purchase price accounting PPA fair value step up) for each reporting segment (Cannabis, Beverage alcohol, Distribution and Wellness) as applicable, 

adjusted gross margin (excluding PPA fair value step up) for each reporting segment (Cannabis, Beverage alcohol, Distribution and Wellness) as applicable, 

adjusted EBITDA, 

cash and marketable securities, and 

constant currency presentation of net revenue. 

All these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, ("GAAP"). These measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to help investors' overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Please see "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures" below for reconciliation of such non-GAAP Measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as a discussion of our adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA measures and the calculation of such measures. 
 
 Constant Currency Presentation 
 
 We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our consolidated net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-to-period comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. To present this information for historical periods, current period net sales for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average monthly exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average monthly exchange rate in effect during the current period of the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. 
 
 Cash and Marketable Securities 
 
 The Company combines the Cash and cash equivalent financial statement line item and the Marketable securities financial statement line item as an aggregate total as reconciled in the liquidity and capital resource section below. The Company s management believes that this presentation provides useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its short-term liquidity position by combining these three GAAP metrics. 

28

Operating Metrics and Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 We use the operating metrics and non-GAAP measures set forth in the table below to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance, and make strategic decisions. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate operating metrics and non-GAAP measures with similar names differently which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures. Certain variances are labeled as not meaningful ("NM") throughout management's discussion and analysis.

Beverage alcohol revenue 
 
 Revenue from our Beverage alcohol operations increased to 56.0 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to revenue of 24.2 million for the prior year period. The increase during the period was predominantly attributed to our recent Craft Acquisition completed on September 29, 2023 and, thus, was not reflected in the prior year comparison. Specifically, the increase was largely driven by the performance of the newly acquired brands, while our legacy brands have maintained consistent performance throughout the period.

Revenue from Canadian medical cannabis: Revenue from Canadian medical cannabis increased to 6.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to revenue of 6.1 million for the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, revenue from Canadian medical cannabis was 6.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to revenue of 6.1 million for the prior year period. This increase in revenue from medical cannabis was primarily driven by growth in the insured patient category exceeding the decline in un-insured patient attrition to the adult-use recreational market. 
 
 Revenue from Canadian adult-use cannabis: During the three months ended August 31, 2024, our revenue from Canadian adult-use cannabis decreased to 57.2 million, compared to revenue of 71.2 million for the prior year period. Revenue in the prior year period included 1.5 million in advisory fees which did not repeat during the three months ended August 31, 2024. On a constant currency basis, our revenue from Canadian adult-use cannabis decreased to 58.8 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The decrease in adult-use revenue was driven by our renewed focus on preserving gross margin and maintaining a higher average selling price in categories that have experienced a high degree of price compression. 
 
 Wholesale cannabis revenue: Revenue from wholesale cannabis increased to 5.5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to revenue of 5.3 million for the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, revenue from wholesale cannabis increased to 5.7 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to revenue of 5.3 million for the prior year period. Due to the transition to asset-light business models, the Canadian cannabis industry has experienced a reduction in excess inventory resulting in price increases in the B2B market. This shift in market dynamics and demand enabled us to strategically sell inventory that was sought after in the wholesale market during the quarter but does not meet the high standard of our branded product. In the near-term future, we anticipate continued volatility and fluctuation in the wholesale market, and we will assess market conditions on a quarterly basis. 
 
 International cannabis revenue: Revenue from international cannabis decreased to 12.2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to revenue of 14.3 million for the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, given the changes in the Euro against the U.S. Dollar when compared to the prior year quarter, revenue from international cannabis was 12.4 million compared to 14.3 million in the prior year period. The decrease in the period was driven in part by the extended time periods to receive import and export permits in Europe, which resulted in variability on a quarterly basis and, to a larger extent, lower revenue in Australia driven by certain regulatory actions on certain prescribers. 

32

Distribution revenue 
 
 Revenue from distribution decreased to 68.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to revenue of 69.2 million for the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, given the change in the Euro and Argentine Peso against the U.S. Dollar in the quarter, revenue from Distribution increased to 70.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 69.2 million for the prior year period. The decrease in revenue was attributed to the effects of foreign exchange. 
 
 Wellness revenue 
 
 Our Wellness revenue showed strong growth delivering 14.8 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 13.3 million from the prior year period. On a constant currency basis for the three months ended August 31, 2024, Wellness revenue increased to 14.9 million from 13.3 million. The increase in revenue was primarily attributed to our strategic focus on continued innovations and strong organic growth within our branded hemp business related to higher consumption.

 Adjusted gross profit is our Gross profit (adjusted to exclude purchase price accounting valuation step-up and adjusted gross margin is our Gross margin (adjusted to exclude purchase price accounting valuation step-up) and are non-GAAP financial measures. See Use of Non-GAAP Measures above for additional discussion regarding these non-GAAP measures. The Company s management believes that adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are useful to our management to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance, and make strategic decisions. We do not consider adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.

Beverage alcohol gross margin: Gross margin of 41 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 decreased from 53 in the prior year period. Adjusted gross margin of 41 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 decreased from 56 in the prior year period. The decrease in the adjusted beverage alcohol gross margin during the three months ended August 31, 2024 was a result of the newly acquired brands in our Craft Acquisition, which have lower margins than our historical business. We are continuing to manage the temporary excess capacity within the acquired breweries, which have already begun seeing optimization and enhanced utilization as well as favorable sales mix. As a result of the seasonality of our beverage business, our third quarter ended February 29, 2024 is our most comparable period reflecting the newly acquired craft brands, to which we improved gross margin by 300 basis points for the aforementioned reasons. 
 
 Cannabis gross margin: Gross margin increased during the three months ended August 31, 2024 to 40 from 28 in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the non-cash fair value purchase price accounting step-up, adjusted gross margin during the three months ended August 31, 2024 increased to 40 from 35 in the prior year period. The increase in the adjusted gross margin for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was driven by our international cannabis revenue as well as a continued focus on maintaining a higher average selling price and selling a favorable product mix to improve gross margins in Canada. Additionally, the prior year period also included 1.5 million of HEXO advisory services revenue, which did not recur in the current year period. 
 
 Distribution gross margin: Gross margin increased to 12 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 from 11 for the prior year period, which was attributed to favorable product mix as we continued to prioritize higher margin product offerings. 
 
 Wellness gross margin: Gross margin increased to 32 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 from 29 from the prior year period. The increase in the three month period was a result of strong operational efficiency, combined with a change in sales mix towards higher margin product offering.

Salaries and wages increased by 29 during the three months ended August 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of newly acquired craft beverage portfolio, which were not in the prior year period. 
 
 Office and general increased by 13 during the three months ended August 31, 2024. This increase was driven by the acquisition of the newly acquired craft beverage portfolio. 

37

The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of 6.9 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 8.3 million for the prior year period. Stock based compensation expense is based on the time-based vesting schedules and varies according to the assumptions used in the vesting model. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, as a result of previously issued stock options, restricted stock units RSUs and stock appreciation rights SARs under Tilray 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and Original Plan, as described in the Annual Report on the May 31, 2024 Form 10-K, that have fully vested, stock-based compensation decreased period over period. 
 
 Insurance expense decreased by 36 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 to 2.5 million from 3.8 million for the prior year period. The decrease for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was driven by lower premiums, offset by the additional polices required for our newly acquired beverage alcohol business portfolio. 
 
 Rent expense increased by 48 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 to 1.3 million from 0.9 million for the prior year period. This increase was driven by the acquisition of the newly acquired beverage alcohol business portfolio. 
 
 Selling costs 
 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company incurred selling costs of 11.7 million and or 5.8 of net revenue as compared to 6.9 million and 3.9 of net revenue in the prior year period. These costs relate to third-party shipping costs for all segments, with the majority of the selling costs relating to distributor commission incurred by the cannabis segment, Health Canada cannabis fees, and patient acquisition and maintenance costs. Patient acquisition and ongoing patient maintenance costs including funding to individual clinics to assist with additional costs incurred by such clinics for the education of patients using the Company s products. The three month increase for the period ended August 31, 2024 is predominately due to the acquisition of the newly acquired craft beverage portfolio, which did not occur in the prior year period. Additionally, in the period ended August 31, 2023, the Company received a refund of 1.2 million on cannabis selling fees related to an amended fee calculation. 
 
 Amortization 
 
 The Company incurred non-production related amortization charges of 21.8 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 22.2 million in the prior year period. The three month decrease was driven by the assets acquired from craft beverage acquisition, offset by the assets that are held for sale and are no longer depreciated, see Note 3 (Capital assets). 
 
 Marketing and promotion costs 
 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company incurred marketing and promotion costs of 11.6 million as compared to 8.5 million for the prior year period, which is due to the acquisition of the newly acquired craft beverage portfolio and quarterly variability in discretionary marketing. 
 
 Research and development 
 
 Research and development costs were 0.1 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 0.1 million in the prior year period. These relate to external costs associated with the development of new products. 
 
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration 
 
 The Company measures contingent consideration at fair value classified as Level 3, as discussed in Note 25 (Fair value measurements). During the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company recognized nil change in fair value of contingent consideration as there were no changes to the likelihood achievement for Montauk Brewing compared to a loss of 11.1 million in the prior year period for the contingent consideration from the SweetWater acquisition as a result of not achieving the earnout targets. 

38

Litigation 
 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company recorded 1.6 million of litigation settlements costs and third-party fees incurred in defending these claims, net of favorable recoveries. This quarterly amount in 2024 decreased compared to 2.0 million for the period ended August, 31 2023. The decrease is related to period-to-period variability as litigation costs and expenses are non-recurring in nature. 
 
 Restructuring costs 
 
 In connection with the execution of our acquisition strategy and strategic transactions, the Company has incurred non-recurring restructuring and exit costs associated with the integration efforts of these transactions. For the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company incurred 4.2 million of restructuring costs compared to 0.9 million for the prior year period. 
 
 Within the Cannabis segment, restructuring costs predominantly related to the HEXO acquisition-related charges, which are expected to take place within 24 months from the acquisition date. In the three months ended August 31, 2024 we recognized 2.6 million of employee termination benefits and costs for the conversion from cannabis to produce at HEXO's Quebec cultivation facility (which is currently held for sale), the optimization of our Redecan facilities and 0.3 million of restructuring charges related to the remaining costs of exiting the Truss facility following its sale to a third party in the previous fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. Additionally, the Company recognized 0.1 million of cost associated with winding down the Fort Collins, CO warehouse currently held for sale. 
 
 Within the Beverage alcohol segment, the Company recognized 0.1 million of employee termination benefits through the integration of the Craft acquisition. 
 
 Within the Distribution segment, the Company recognized 0.1 million of restructuring charges for its Argentinean pharmacy business. 
 
 Lastly, for the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company recognized 1.1 million of cost associated with the investment held in Superhero (SH) as a result of MedMen s ongoing restructuring or liquidation undertakings. 
 
 Transaction (income) costs, net 
 
 Transaction (income) costs net, which includes acquisition related income and expenses, related legal, financial advisor and due diligence cost and expenses and transaction related compensation. The three months ended August 31, 2024 decrease of 86 from the prior year period was a result of the HEXO and Truss acquisitions taking place in the previous year which did not recur. The expenses incurred in the current period largely related the acquisition of the four craft beer brands and breweries from Molson that was completed subsequent to the quarter end, see Note 27 (Subsequent Events).

For the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company recognized a change in fair value of its convertible debentures payable of nil million compared to 2.1) million in the prior year period. The change was driven primarily by the settlement of APHA 24 convertible debenture upon maturity. Additionally, for the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company recognized a change in fair value of its warrants, resulting in a gain of 0.7 million compared to a loss of 8.2) million as a result of the change in our share price and the exercise price of the instrument. For the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company recognized a gain of 11.9 million resulting from the changes in foreign exchange rates during the period compared a gain of 6.3 million for the prior year period. 
 
 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA as net loss/net income before income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, equity in net loss of equity-method investees, purchase price accounting step-up on inventory, stock-based compensation, impairments, other than temporary change in fair value of convertible notes receivable, restructuring costs, transaction (income) costs net, litigation costs net of recoveries, change in fair value of contingent consideration, unrealized currency gains and losses and other adjustments. 
 
 We believe that this presentation provides useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses this measure for reviewing the financial results of the Company and as a component of performance-based executive compensation. 
 
 Historically, we have included lease expenses for leases that were treated differently under IFRS 16 and ASC 842 Leases in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA, aiming to align our definition with industry peers reporting under IFRS. The decision to include these lease expenses in the Company's definition of adjusted EBITDA was based on our efforts to maintain comparability with peers. However, as the Company has continued to diversify, particularly with strategic acquisitions such as the newly acquired beverage alcohol business portfolio, this comparison is no longer relevant, accordingly, we are no longer including this adjustment. 
 
 Under the previous reconciliation, when the Company had continued to include lease expenses that were treated differently under IFRS 16 and ASC 842, the impact to adjusted EBITDA was 0.7 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. 
 
 We do not consider adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes certain expenses and income that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, adjusted EBITDA is subject to inherent limitations as this metric reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining adjusted EBITDA. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents adjusted EBITDA in connection with GAAP results. 
 
 For three months ended August 31, 2024, adjusted EBITDA decreased to 9.3 million compared to 10.7 million for the prior year period.

Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net loss. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA as compared to net loss, the closest comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts for the following: 

Non-cash amortization expenses and, although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future; 

Stock-based compensation expenses, a non-cash expense and are an important part of our compensation strategy; 

Non-cash impairment charges, as the charges are not expected to be a recurring business activity; 

Non-cash other than temporary write-down of convertible notes receivable, as the charges are not expected to be a recurring business activity; 

Non-cash foreign exchange gains or losses, which accounts for the effect of both realized and unrealized foreign exchange transactions. Unrealized gains or losses represent foreign exchange revaluation of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities; 

Non-cash change in fair value of warrant liability; 

Interest expense, net; 

Costs incurred to start up new facilities, and to fund emerging market operations; 

Transaction (income) costs, net which includes acquisition related income and expenses, related legal, financial advisor and due diligence cost and expenses and transaction related compensation, which vary significantly by transaction and are excluded to evaluate ongoing operating results; 

Restructuring charges; 

Litigation costs, net of favorable recoveries and the third party fees associated with defending these claims, includes costs related to legacy and non-operational litigation matters, legal settlements and recoveries; 

Amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up in inventory value included in costs of goods sold; and 

Current and deferred income tax expenses and recoveries, which could be a significant recurring expense or recovery in our business in the future and reduce or increase cash available to us. 

42

Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin 
 
 Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are non-GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Adjusted gross profit is our Gross profit (adjusted to exclude PPA valuation step-up) and adjusted gross margin is our Gross margin (adjusted to exclude PPA valuation step-up) and are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company s management believes that adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are useful to our management to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance, and make strategic decisions. We do not consider adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin percentage in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, and complete acquisitions. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs for the short and long term outlook. 
 
 For the Company's short-term liquidity requirements, we are focused on generating positive cash flows from operations and being free cash flow positive. As a result of delays in legalization across multiple markets, management continues to optimize our operating structure, headcount, as well as the elimination of other discretionary operational costs. Additionally, the Company continues to invest our excess cash in the short-term in marketable securities which are comprised of U.S. treasury bills, term deposits with major Canadian, European and Australian banks. 
 
 For the Company's long-term liquidity requirements, we are focused on funding operations through profitable organic and inorganic growth through acquisitions. We may need to take on additional debt or equity financing arrangements in order to achieve these ambitions on a long-term basis. 
 
 On May 17, 2024, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement with TD Securities (USA) LLC TD Securities and Jefferies LLC Jefferies in connection with an aggregate offering value of up to 250 million from time to time through an at-the-market equity program ATM Program ). During the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company issued 36,693,307 shares under its At-the-Market ATM program generating gross proceeds of 68.3 million. The Company paid 1.8 million in commissions and other fees associated with these issuances generating net proceeds of 66.5 million. See Note 27 (Subsequent events) for additional transactions. The Company intends to use net proceeds from the ATM Program to fund strategic and accretive acquisitions or investments in businesses, including potential acquisitions of assets in the U.S. and internationally in order to capitalize on expected regulatory advancements or expansion opportunities. 
 
 Additionally, we are committed to optimizing our capital structure and enhancing financial flexibility as we intend to continue to opportunistically purchase or exchange equity for the TLRY 27 Notes prior to their underlying maturity date in June 2027. See Note 27 (Subsequent events) for additional transactions.

 Subsequent Events 
 
 Refer to Part I, Financial Information, Note 27 Subsequent Events. 
 
 Contingencies 
 
 In addition to the litigation described in the Part II, Item 1 - Legal Proceedings, the Company is and may be a defendant in lawsuits from time to time in the normal course of business. While the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes the reasonably possible losses of such matters, individually and in the aggregate, are not material. Additionally, the Company believes the probable final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows or liquidity. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The accounting principles we use require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting policies, however, materially different amounts may be reported under different conditions or using assumptions different from those that we have applied. The accounting estimates that have been identified as critical to our business operations and to understanding the results of our operations pertain to revenue recognition, valuation of inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets, stock-based compensation and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. The application of each of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, and summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
 
 Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of August 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported and (b) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Consistent with guidance issued by the SEC, the scope of management s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of our recently acquired businesses including: the portfolio of craft beer brands, assets and businesses comprising eight beer and beverage brands, acquired on September 29, 2023 in the Craft Acquisition. The acquired businesses represented 3.5 of our consolidated assets and 13.3 of our consolidated net revenues as of and for the three months ended August 31, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As mentioned above, the Company acquired the eight beer and beverage brands on September 29, 2023. The Company is in the process of reviewing the internal control structure of the eight beer and, beverage brands and if necessary, will make appropriate changes as it integrates them into the Company s overall internal control over financial reporting process.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are at times subject to various legal proceedings and disputes, including the proceedings specifically discussed below. We assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. Where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of loss is not estimable, we do not accrue legal reserves. While the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available, our management believes that it has established appropriate legal reserves. Any liabilities arising from pending legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 includes a discussion of our legal proceedings. There have been no material changes from the legal proceedings described in our Form 10-K, except with respect to the matters disclosed and incorporated herein by reference to Note 19 (Commitments and contingencies), in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

A summary of our risk factors is included below. Except for the below risk factors, there have been no material changes from the risk factors described in our Form 10-K. 

We may not achieve the expected revenue or other benefits from the craft beer operations acquired. 

We may experience difficulties integrating operations and realizing the expected benefits of recent acquisitions, including the HEXO arrangement and the Craft brands acquisitions. 

We may have to recognize significant impairments in the carrying value of our investment in the MedMen secured convertible notes as a result of MedMen s potential restructuring or liquidation undertakings. 

Additional impairments of our goodwill, impairments of our intangible and other long-lived assets, and changes in the estimated useful lives of intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. 

Our business is dependent upon regulatory approvals and licenses, ongoing compliance and reporting obligations, and timely renewals. 

Government regulation is evolving, and unfavorable changes or lack of commercial legalization could impact our ability to carry on our business as currently conducted and the potential expansion of our business. 

Our production and processing facilities are integral to our business and adverse changes or developments affecting our facilities may have an adverse impact on our business. 

We face intense competition, and anticipate competition will increase, which could hurt our business. 

Regulations constrain our ability to market and distribute our products in Canada. 

United States regulations relating to hemp-derived CBD products, including Delta 9 beverages, are new and rapidly evolving, and changes may not develop in the timeframe or manner most favorable to our business objectives. 

Changes in consumer preferences or public attitudes about alcohol could decrease demand for our beverage alcohol products. 

SweetWater Brewing, Breckenridge Distillery, Montauk Brewing and our recently-acquired craft beer brands each face substantial competition in the beer industry or the broader market for alcoholic beverage products which could impact our business and financial results. 

We have a limited operating history and a history of net losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. 

We are subject to litigation, arbitration and demands, which could result in significant liability and costs, and impact our resources and reputation. 

Our strategic alliances and other third-party business relationships may not achieve the intended beneficial impact and expose us to risks. 

We may not be able to successfully identify and execute future acquisitions, dispositions or other equity transactions or to successfully manage the impacts of such transactions on our operations. 

We are subject to risks inherent in an agricultural business, including the risk of crop failure. 

We depend on significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue. If we fail to retain or expand our customer relationships or significant customers reduce their purchases, our revenue could decline significantly. 

Our products may be subject to recalls for a variety of reasons, which could require us to expend significant management and capital resources. 

Significant interruptions in our access to certain supply chains for key inputs such as raw materials, supplies, electricity, water and other utilities may impair our operations. 

Management may not be able to successfully establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. 

The price of our common stock in public markets has experienced and may continue to experience severe volatility and fluctuations. 

The volatility of our stock and the stockholder base may hinder or prevent us from engaging in beneficial corporate initiatives. 

The terms of our outstanding warrants may limit our ability to raise additional equity capital or pursue acquisitions, which may impact funding of our ongoing operations and cause significant dilution to existing stockholders. 

We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible securities in cash or to repurchase the convertible securities upon a fundamental change. 

We are subject to other risks generally applicable to our industry and the conduct of our business.
