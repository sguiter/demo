The CAPL Credit Facility is a million revolving credit facility maturing that is secured by substantially all of the Partnership s assets. Letters of credit outstanding totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Taking the interest rate swap contracts into account, the effective interest rate on our CAPL Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 was (our applicable margin was as of September 30, 2024). See Note 8 for additional information on our interest rate swap contracts. The CAPL Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants. The Partnership is required to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the CAPL Credit Facility) of (i) for each fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, not greater than to , and (ii) for each fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2024 and thereafter, not greater than to . For the quarter during a Specified Acquisition Period (as defined in the CAPL Credit Facility), such threshold will be increased by increasing the numerator thereof by , but such numerator may not exceed to . Upon the occurrence of a Qualified Note Offering (as defined in the CAPL Credit Facility), the Consolidated Leverage Ratio threshold when not in a Specified Acquisition Period is increased to to , while the Specified Acquisition Period threshold is to . Upon the occurrence of a Qualified Note Offering, the Partnership is also required to maintain a Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the CAPL Credit Facility) for the most recently completed four fiscal quarter period of not greater than to .

 million. In connection with amending the CAPL Credit Facility and terminating the JKM Credit Facility in March 2023, the Partnership wrote off million of deferred financing costs in the first quarter of 2023. 

Our interest rate swap contracts fix the rate on a portion of our SOFR-based borrowings under our CAPL Credit Facility, have been designated as cash flow hedges and are expected to be highly effective. The first three swap contracts above matured , and as a result, our effective interest rate on the CAPL Credit Facility has increased since that time. The fair value of each of these interest rate swap contracts was reported as a separate line item within current assets, noncurrent assets, current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, as applicable. See Note 12 for additional information on the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts. We report the unrealized gains and losses on our interest rate swap contracts designated as highly effective cash flow hedges as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify such gains and losses into earnings (interest expense on our statement of operations) in the same period during which the hedged interest expense is recorded. We recognized a net realized gain from settlements of the interest rate swap contracts of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We currently estimate that a net gain of million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into interest expense during the next months; however, the actual amount that will be reclassified will vary based on changes in interest rates.

Amounts payable to this related party amounted to million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Vehicle Lease In connection with the services rendered under the Omnibus Agreement, we lease certain vehicles from an entity affiliated with the Topper Group, as approved by the independent conflicts committee of the Board. Lease expense was an amount for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Principal Executive Offices We lease office space from an affiliate of John B. Reilly, III and Joseph V. Topper, Jr., members of our Board, as approved by the independent conflicts committee of the Board. Rent expense amounted to million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Public Relations and Website Consulting Services We have engaged a company affiliated with John B. Reilly, III, member of the Board, for public relations and website consulting services. The cost of these services was insignificant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

In the event we fail to purchase the required minimum volume for a given contractual period, the underlying third party s exclusive remedies (depending on the magnitude of the failure) are either termination of the supply agreement and/or a financial penalty per gallon based on the volume shortfall for the given period. We did not incur any significant penalties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Litigation Matters We are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damages, environmental damages, employment-related claims and damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record an accrual when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we disclose matters for which management believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible. We believe that it is not reasonably possible that these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In all instances, management has assessed the matter based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, giving due consideration to the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought and the probability of success. Management s judgment may prove materially inaccurate, and such judgment is made subject to the known uncertainties of litigation. Environmental Matters We currently own or lease sites where refined petroleum products are being or have been handled. These sites and the refined petroleum products handled thereon may be subject to federal and state environmental laws and regulations. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate containerized hazardous liquids or associated generated wastes (including wastes disposed of or abandoned by prior owners or operators), to remediate contaminated property arising from the release of liquids or wastes into the environment, including contaminated groundwater, or to implement best management practices to prevent future contamination. We maintain insurance of various types with varying levels of coverage that is considered adequate under the circumstances to cover operations and properties. The insurance policies are subject to deductibles that are considered reasonable and not excessive. In addition, we have entered into indemnification and escrow agreements with various sellers in conjunction with several of their respective acquisitions, as further described below. Financial responsibility for environmental remediation is negotiated in connection with each acquisition transaction. In each case, an assessment is made of potential environmental liability exposure based on available information. Based on that assessment and relevant economic and risk factors, a determination is made whether to, and the extent to which we will, assume liability for existing environmental conditions.

 million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Indemnification assets related to third-party escrow funds, state funds or insurance recorded on the balance sheet within other current assets and other noncurrent assets totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. State funds represent probable state reimbursement amounts. Reimbursement will depend upon the continued maintenance and solvency of the state. Insurance coverage represents amounts deemed probable of reimbursement under insurance policies. The estimates used in these reserves are based on all known facts at the time and an assessment of the ultimate remedial action outcomes. We will adjust loss accruals as further information becomes available or circumstances change. Among the many uncertainties that impact the estimates are the necessary regulatory approvals for, and potential modifications of, remediation plans, the amount of data available upon initial assessment of the impact of soil or water contamination, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to additional claims. Environmental liabilities related to the sites contributed to the Partnership in connection with our IPO have not been assigned to us and are still the responsibility of the Predecessor Entity. The Predecessor Entity indemnified us for any costs or expenses that we incur for environmental liabilities and third-party claims, regardless of when a claim is made, that are based on environmental conditions in existence prior to the closing of the IPO for contributed sites. As such, these environmental liabilities and indemnification assets are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet of the Partnership. Similarly, we have generally been indemnified with respect to known contamination at sites acquired from third parties. As such, these environmental liabilities and indemnification assets are also not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet of the Partnership.

 segments: 1) the wholesale segment and 2) the retail segment. The wholesale segment includes the wholesale distribution of motor fuel to lessee dealers and independent dealers. We have exclusive motor fuel distribution contracts with lessee dealers who lease the property from us. We also have exclusive distribution contracts with independent dealers to distribute motor fuel but do not collect rent from the independent dealers. The retail segment includes the retail sale of motor fuel at retail sites operated by commission agents and the sale of convenience merchandise items and the retail sale of motor fuel at company operated sites. A commission agent site is a retail site where we retain title to the motor fuel inventory and sell it directly to our end user customers. At commission agent retail sites, we manage motor fuel inventory pricing and retain the gross profit on motor fuel sales, less a commission to the agent who operates the retail site. Similar to our wholesale segment, we also generate revenues through leasing or subleasing real estate in our retail segment. Unallocated items consist primarily of general and administrative expenses, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, gains on dispositions and lease terminations, net, other income, interest expense and income tax expense. Total assets by segment are not presented as management does not currently assess performance or allocate resources based on that data. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, we converted and sites from lessee dealer sites in the wholesale segment to company operated or commission sites in the retail segment, net. The sites converted during the first nine months of 2024 include sites from the Applegreen Acquisition. See Note 2 for additional information. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, we converted and sites from lessee dealer sites in the wholesale segment to company operated or commission sites in the retail segment.

Recent Developments 
 Applegreen Acquisition and Lease Termination 
 On January 26, 2024, we entered into an agreement (the Applegreen Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets from Applegreen Midwest, LLC and Applegreen Florida, LLC (collectively, the Sellers (the Applegreen Acquisition ). The assets were acquired via the termination of the Partnership s existing lease agreements with the Sellers at 59 locations, for total consideration of 16.9 million. The transaction closed on a rolling basis by site beginning in the first quarter of 2024 and ending in April 2024. The Partnership also acquired for cash the inventory at the locations. The terms of the Partnership s leases with Applegreen Midwest, LLC and Applegreen Florida, LLC could have been extended to 2049 and 2048, respectively, including all renewal options. The Applegreen Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties as well as indemnification obligations by the Sellers and the Partnership, respectively, to each other. 
 Of the 59 locations, 31 locations converted during the first quarter of 2024 and the remaining locations converted in April 2024. This transaction resulted in the transition of these lessee dealer sites to company operated sites. 
 During the first half of 2024, we paid 25.5 million of cash and recorded a non-cash write-off of deferred rent income of 1.5 million. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Amendment of CAPL Credit Facility 
 On February 20, 2024, in connection with our Applegreen Acquisition, we entered into an amendment (the Amendment to the CAPL Credit Facility. The Amendment, among other things, modified the definition of Consolidated EBITDA contained in the Credit Agreement to permit the full addback of certain lease termination expenses incurred in connection with the Applegreen Acquisition and the addback of other lease termination expenses incurred in connection with future transactions, subject to certain terms and conditions. 
 Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability 
 The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit 
 The prices paid to our motor fuel suppliers for wholesale motor fuel (which affects our cost of sales) are highly correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil, and, correspondingly, the market prices of wholesale motor fuel, experience significant and rapid fluctuations. For approximately 55 of gallons sold, we receive a per gallon rate equal to the posted rack price, less any applicable discounts, plus transportation costs, taxes and a fixed rate per gallon of motor fuel. The remaining gallons are either retail sales or wholesale DTW contracts that provide for variable, market-based pricing. 
 Regarding our supplier relationships, a material amount of our total gallons purchased are subject to prompt payment discounts. The dollar value of these discounts varies with changes in motor fuel prices. Therefore, in periods of lower wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is negatively affected, and, in periods of higher wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is positively affected (as it relates to these discounts). 
 In our retail business, we attempt to pass along wholesale motor fuel price changes to our retail customers through at the pump retail price changes; however, market conditions do not always allow us to do so immediately. The timing of any related increase or decrease in at the pump retail prices is affected by competitive conditions in each geographic market in which we operate. As such, the prices we charge our customers for motor fuel and the gross profit we receive on our motor fuel sales can increase or decrease significantly over short periods of time. 
 Changes in our average motor fuel selling price per gallon and gross margin are directly related to the changes in crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices. Variations in our reported revenues and cost of sales are, therefore, primarily related to the price of crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices and generally not as a result of changes in motor fuel sales volumes, unless otherwise indicated and discussed below. 
 Seasonality Effects on Volumes 
 Our business is subject to seasonality due to our wholesale and retail sites being located in certain geographic areas that are affected by seasonal weather and temperature trends and associated changes in retail customer activity during different seasons. Historically, sales volumes have been highest in the second and third quarters (during the summer months) and lowest during the winter months in the first and fourth quarters. 
 20 

Impact of Inflation 
 Inflation affects our financial performance by increasing certain components of cost of goods sold, such as fuel, merchandise, and credit card fees. Inflation also affects certain operating expenses, such as labor costs, certain leases, and general and administrative expenses. While our wholesale segment benefits from higher terms discounts as a result of higher fuel costs, inflation could and recently has negatively impacted our cost of goods sold and operating expenses. Although we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through price increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. 
 Impact of Interest Rates 
 Three of our most favorable interest rate swap contracts matured April 1, 2024. As a result and due to increases in interest rates in general, our effective interest rate has increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Acquisition and Financing Activity 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are also impacted by our acquisition and financing activities as summarized below. 
 On March 31, 2023, we amended and restated the CAPL Credit Facility and terminated the JKM Credit Facility. 

During the first half of 2024, we converted the 59 sites included in the Applegreen Acquisition and transitioned these sites from lessee dealer sites in the wholesale segment to company operated sites in the retail segment. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating revenues decreased 131 million (11 and operating income increased 3 million (12 ). Significant items impacting these results were: 
 Operating revenues 
 Our wholesale segment revenues decreased 164 million (26 primarily due to a 14 decrease in our average wholesale fuel selling price. The average spot price of WTI crude oil decreased 7 to 76.43 per barrel for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 82.25 per barrel for the third quarter of 2023. In addition, volume decreased 14 driven by the conversion of certain lessee dealer sites to company operated and commission agent sites as well as the net loss of independent dealer contracts. 

Our retail segment revenues increased 33 million (6 primarily attributable to a 12 increase in volume due to the conversion of certain lessee dealer sites to company operated and commission agent sites, partially offset by a 9 decrease in the average retail fuel price from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 due to the decrease in wholesale motor fuel prices as noted above. Merchandise revenues increased 21 million (23 driven by an increase in our average company operated site count due to the conversion of certain lessee dealer and commission agent sites to company operated sites. 

Cost of sales 
 Cost of sales decreased 142 million (13 ), due primarily to lower wholesale volume and lower cost per gallon, partially offset by an increase in merchandise cost of sales driven by the same drivers as discussed above. 
 Gross profit 
 Gross profit increased 11 million (11 ), which was primarily driven by an increase in merchandise and motor fuel gross profit within our retail segment, partially offset by a decrease in motor fuel and rent gross profit within our wholesale segment. See Results of Operations Segment Results for additional gross profit analyses. 
 Operating expenses 
 See Results of Operations Segment Results for analyses. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased 0.4 million (6 primarily driven by higher management fees and system and information technology costs, partially offset by lower equity compensation expense. 
 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 
 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased 1.6 million (9 primarily due to a 3.2 million increase in impairment charges during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023, partially offset by the impact of assets becoming fully depreciated. 
 Gain (loss) on dispositions and lease terminations, net 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 5.3 million net gain in connection with our ongoing real estate rationalization effort, partially offset by 0.6 million of net losses on lease terminations and asset disposals. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased 3.6 million (34 primarily due to the maturity of three of our most favorable interest rate swap contracts on April 1, 2024. 
 22 

Income tax expense 
 We recorded income tax expense of 2.4 million and 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, driven by income generated by our taxable subsidiaries. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating revenues decreased 218 million (6 and operating income decreased 19 million (31 ). Significant items impacting these results were: 
 Operating revenues 
 Our wholesale segment revenues decreased 312 million (18 primarily attributable to a 12 decrease in volume driven by the conversion of certain lessee dealer sites to company operated and commission agent sites as well as the net loss of independent dealer contracts. In addition, our average wholesale selling price decreased 7 due primarily to movements in crude oil prices within the two periods. 

Our retail segment revenues increased 95 million (6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to an 8 increase in volume due to the conversion of certain lessee dealer sites to company operated and commission agent sites, partially offset by a 5 decrease in the average retail fuel selling price due to the decrease in wholesale motor fuel prices as noted above. Merchandise revenues increased 54 million (23 driven by an increase in our average company operated site count due to the conversion of certain lessee dealer and commission agent sites to company operated sites. 

Cost of sales 
 Cost of sales decreased 235 million (8 ), due primarily to lower wholesale volume and lower cost per gallon, partially offset by an increase in merchandise cost of sales driven by the same drivers as discussed above. 
 Gross profit 
 Gross profit increased 17 million (6 ), which was primarily driven by an increase in merchandise and motor fuel gross profit within our retail segment, partially offset by a decrease in motor fuel and rent gross profit within our wholesale segment. See Results of Operations Segment Results for additional gross profit analyses. 
 Operating expenses 
 See Results of Operations Segment Results for analyses. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased 1.9 million (10 primarily driven by higher management fees, legal fees, system and information technology costs and acquisition related costs, partially offset by lower equity incentive compensation expense. 
 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 
 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense decreased 0.3 million (1 primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated, partially offset by a 2.9 million increase in impairment charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. 
 Gain (loss) on dispositions and lease terminations, net 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 16.0 million loss on lease termination with Applegreen, including a 1.5 million non-cash write-off of deferred rent income (see Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information). In addition, we recorded 2.3 million of other losses on lease terminations and asset disposals, including non-cash write-offs of deferred rent income. We recorded an 11.8 million net gain in connection with our ongoing real estate rationalization effort. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 6.3 million net gain in connection with our ongoing real estate rationalization effort and a 1.1 million net loss on lease terminations and asset disposals.

 Interest expense increased 5.7 million (17 due to the maturity of three of our most favorable interest rate swap contracts on April 1, 2024 in addition to the general increase in interest rates, partially offset by the 1.1 million write-off of deferred financing costs in the first quarter of 2023 as a result of the amendment and restatement of the CAPL Credit Facility and termination of the JKM Credit Facility. 
 Income tax (benefit) expense 
 We recorded an income tax (benefit) expense of (1.7) million and 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, driven by (losses incurred) income generated by our taxable subsidiaries.

(a) In addition, we distributed motor fuel to sub-wholesalers who distributed to additional sites. 

(b) The decrease in the independent dealer site count was primarily attributable to the net loss of contracts, partially offset by divestitures of certain lessee dealer sites but with continued fuel supply. 

(c) The decrease in the lessee dealer site count was primarily attributable to the conversion of certain lessee dealer sites to company operated and commission agent sites, including through the Applegreen Acquisition, and our real estate rationalization effort. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Gross profit decreased 5.2 million (16 and operating income decreased 4.3 million (18 ). These results were impacted by: 
 Motor fuel gross profit 
 The 1.9 million decrease (10 in motor fuel gross profit was primarily due to a 14 decrease in volume driven by the conversion of certain lessee dealer sites to company operated and commission agent sites and the net loss of independent dealer contracts, partially offset by an increase in fuel margin per gallon of 4 as compared to the same period of 2023, driven by the movements of crude oil prices within the two periods. 
 The average spot price of WTI crude oil decreased 7 from 82.25 per barrel for the third quarter of 2023 to 76.43 per barrel for the third quarter of 2024. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit. 
 Rent gross profit 
 Rent gross profit decreased 2.9 million (23 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to the conversion of certain lessee dealer sites to company operated and commission agent sites. 
 Operating expenses 
 Operating expenses decreased 0.9 million (10 ), primarily due to the conversion of certain lessee dealer sites to company operated and commission agent sites. 
 26 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Gross profit decreased 13.0 million (14 and operating income decreased 8.7 million (13 ). These results were impacted by: 
 Motor fuel gross profit 
 The 5.3 million decrease (10 in motor fuel gross profit was primarily due to a 12 decrease in volume driven by the conversion of certain lessee dealer sites to company operated and commission agent sites and the net loss of independent dealer contracts. 
 Rent gross profit 
 Rent gross profit decreased 6.9 million (18 ), primarily due to the conversion of certain lessee dealer sites to company operated and commission agent sites. 
 Operating expenses 
 Operating expenses decreased 4.3 million (15 ), primarily due to the conversion of certain lessee dealer sites to company operated and commission agent sites. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use the non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio. EBITDA represents net income before deducting interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, amortization and accretion (which includes certain impairment charges). Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude equity-based compensation expense, gains or losses on dispositions and lease terminations, net and certain discrete acquisition related costs, such as legal and other professional fees, separation benefit costs and certain other discrete non-cash items arising from purchase accounting. Distributable Cash Flow represents Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense, sustaining capital expenditures and current income tax expense. The Distribution Coverage Ratio is computed by dividing Distributable Cash Flow by distributions paid on common units. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and lenders. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used to assess our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or income taxes and the ability to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used to assess the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis by excluding the impact of items which do not result directly from the wholesale distribution of motor fuel, the leasing of real property, or the day to day operations of our retail site activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are also used to assess the ability to generate cash sufficient to make distributions to our unitholders. 
 We believe the presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio provides useful information to investors in assessing the financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio should not be considered alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income. Additionally, because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.

(b) Relates to certain acquisition-related costs, such as legal and other professional fees, separation benefit costs and purchase accounting adjustments associated with recent acquisitions. 

(c) Under the Partnership Agreement, sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Examples of sustaining capital expenditures are those made to maintain existing contract volumes, including payments to renew existing distribution contracts, or to maintain our sites in conditions suitable to lease, such as parking lot or roof replacement/renovation, or to replace equipment required to operate the existing business. 

(d) Excludes income tax incurred on the sale of sites. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Our principal liquidity requirements are to finance our operations, fund acquisitions, service our debt and pay distributions to our unitholders. We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated by operations, proceeds from sales of sites in connection with our real estate rationalization efforts, borrowings under the CAPL Credit Facility, and if available to us on acceptable terms, issuances of equity and debt securities. We regularly evaluate alternate sources of capital to support our liquidity requirements. 
 Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, and partnership distributions, will depend on our future operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. As a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, we will, from time to time, consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance our indebtedness. Changes in our operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods. 
 We believe that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under the CAPL Credit Facility, access to capital markets and alternate sources of funding to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies, anticipated capital expenditures and partnership distributions. However, we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow. A material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity as well as our ability to issue additional equity and/or debt securities and/or maintain or increase distributions to unitholders.

Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes cash flow activity (in thousands):

(72,718) 

Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily attributable to the weaker results in the first quarter of 2024 as well as an increase in interest expense driven by the maturity of three of our most favorable interest rate swap contracts on April 1, 2024. Changes in working capital drove an increase in cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to timing of settlement with our fuel suppliers. 
 As is typical in our industry, our current liabilities exceed our current assets as a result of the longer settlement of real estate and motor fuel taxes as compared to the shorter settlement of receivables for fuel, rent and merchandise. 
 Investing Activities 
 We incurred capital expenditures of 19 million and 22 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We paid 26 million to Applegreen related to lease terminations and inventory purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We received 18 million and 5 million in proceeds primarily from the sale of sites in connection with our real estate rationalization effort for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Financing Activities 
 We paid 60 million in distributions for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we made total net borrowings (repayments) on our credit facilities of 16 million and 3) million, respectively. We paid 7 million of deferred financing costs in connection with amending and restating the CAPL Credit Facility and terminating the JKM Credit Facility in the first quarter of 2023.

The amount of any distribution is subject to the discretion of the Board, which may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time. Our Partnership Agreement does not require us to pay any distributions. As such, there can be no assurance we will continue to pay distributions in the future. 
 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, our debt and finance lease obligations consisted of the following (in thousands):

See Note 7 to the financial statements for information regarding the amendment of the CAPL Credit Facility. 
 Taking the interest rate swap contracts into account, our effective interest rate on our CAPL Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 was 6.5 (our applicable margin was 2.25 as of September 30, 2024). Letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2024 totaled 5.3 million. 
 The amount of availability under our CAPL Credit Facility at November 1, 2024, after taking into consideration debt covenant restrictions, was 101 million. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We make investments to expand, upgrade and enhance existing assets. We categorize our capital requirements as either sustaining capital expenditures, growth capital expenditures or acquisition capital expenditures. Sustaining capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Growth capital expenditures, which include individual site purchases, and acquisition capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term. We have the ability to fund our capital expenditures by additional borrowings under our CAPL Credit Facility, or, if available to us on acceptable terms, accessing the capital markets and issuing additional equity, debt securities or other options, such as the sale of assets. Our ability to access the capital markets may have an impact on our ability to fund acquisitions. We may not be able to complete any offering of securities or other options on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

A significant portion of our growth capital expenditures are discretionary and we regularly review our capital plans in light of anticipated proceeds from sales of sites. 
 Concentration Risks 
 See Note 1 for information on our concentration risks related to our customers, fuel suppliers, fuel carriers and merchandise suppliers. 
 30 

Outlook 
 As noted previously, the prices paid to our motor fuel suppliers for wholesale motor fuel (which affects our cost of sales) are highly correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil, and, correspondingly, the market prices of wholesale motor fuel, experience significant and rapid fluctuations, which affect our motor fuel gross profit. 
 Our results for 2024 are anticipated to be impacted by the following: 
 We continue to consider the highest and best use class of trade for each of our properties, which may result in the conversion of sites from one class of trade to another and ultimately increases or decreases in the gross profit for the wholesale and retail segments. The Applegreen Acquisition as well as other conversions of lessee dealer sites to company operated and commission agent sites are anticipated to increase gross profit and operating expenses in the retail segment and reduce gross profit in the wholesale segment. 

As part of our evaluation of the highest and best use class of trade for each of our properties, we anticipate continuing to divest certain assets, often lower performing properties. These sales are likely to continue to generate gains or impairment charges depending on the site, and may result in reductions in gross profit in the wholesale and retail segments. For many of these divestitures, we anticipate continuing to supply the sites with fuel through long-term supply contracts. 

Given the April 1, 2024 maturity of certain favorable interest rate swap contracts, we anticipate higher interest expense in 2024 relative to 2023. 

We will continue to evaluate acquisitions on an opportunistic basis. Additionally, we will pursue acquisition targets that fit into our strategy. Whether we will be able to execute acquisitions will depend on market conditions, availability of suitable acquisition targets at attractive terms, acquisition-related compliance with customary regulatory requirements, and our ability to finance such acquisitions on favorable terms and in compliance with our debt covenant restrictions. 
 New Accounting Policies 
 There is no new accounting guidance effective or pending adoption that has had or is anticipated to have a material impact on our financial statements. See Note 1 to the financial statements for information on new accounting guidance that will impact segment reporting and income tax disclosures. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies described in our Form 10-K. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Other than interest rate risk, no significant changes to our market risk have occurred since December 31, 2023. For a discussion of market risks affecting us, refer to Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in our Form 10-K. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 772.4 million outstanding on our CAPL Credit Facility. Our outstanding borrowings bear interest at SOFR plus an applicable margin. 
 Taking the interest rate swap contracts into account, the effective interest rate on our CAPL Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 was 6.5 . A one percentage point change in SOFR would impact annual interest expense by approximately 3.7 million. 
 See Note 8 to the financial statements for information regarding our interest rate swap contracts. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
