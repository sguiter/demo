A. 

During the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed a review of the useful lives of its beverage machinery and equipment and buildings based on the Company s experience with the duration over which equipment and buildings of its aluminum beverage can business can be utilized. The Company engaged a third-party appraiser to assist in this review and, as a result, effective January 1, 2024, the Company revised the estimated useful lives of buildings up to years and machinery and equipment up to years. The change in useful lives resulted in a net reduction in depreciation expense of approximately or and or per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the amount of depreciation expense that would have been recorded by utilizing the prior depreciable lives. 
 
 In the first quarter of 2024, the Company corrected its presentation of certain borrowings and repayments of short-term debt that did not qualify for net presentation in our previously issued Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company now presents these borrowings and repayments of short-term debt on a gross basis within cash flows from financing activities. The Company determined that the corrections, which had no impact to cash flows (used for) provided by financing activities, were not material to any prior annual or interim periods and therefore, amendments of previously filed reports are not required.

The supplier invoices that have been confirmed as valid under the programs typically have payment terms of days or less, consistent with the commercial terms and conditions as agreed upon with suppliers. The Company had and confirmed obligations outstanding under these supplier finance programs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included in Accounts Payable . 

H. ) Restructuring Other costs ) 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company closed its food can plant in La Villa, Mexico and entered into an agreement to sell equipment for to be paid in annual installments. The first installment was received during the second quarter. The Company recognized a gain of in the third quarter of 2024, when control of the equipment transferred. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, restructuring primarily included headcount reductions and other exit costs in the Company's European Beverage and Other segments. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made payments of and had a restructuring accrual of , primarily related to previously announced restructuring actions and the items referenced above. The Company expects to pay these amounts over the next twelve months. The Company continues to review its costs structure and may record additional restructuring charges in the future. 

I. 
 
 after the stock purchase, this U.S. company sold its insulation assets and was later merged into Crown Cork. 
 
 Prior to 1998, amounts paid to asbestos claimants were covered by a fund made available to Crown Cork under a 1985 settlement with carriers insuring Crown Cork through 1976, when Crown Cork became self-insured. The fund was depleted in 1998 and the Company has no remaining coverage for asbestos-related costs. 
 
 In December 2001, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted legislation that limits the asbestos-related liabilities of Pennsylvania corporations that are successors by corporate merger to companies involved with asbestos. The legislation limits the successor s liability for asbestos to the acquired company s asset value adjusted for inflation. Crown Cork has paid significantly more for asbestos-related claims than the acquired company s adjusted asset value. In November 2004, the legislation was amended to address a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision (Ieropoli v. AC S Corporation, et. al., No. 117 EM 2002) which held that the statute violated the Pennsylvania Constitution due to retroactive application. The Company cautions that the limitations of the statute, as amended, are subject to litigation and may not be upheld.

to settle asbestos claims and pay related legal and defense costs and had approximate claims activity as follows: 
 
 Beginning claims New claims Settlements or dismissals ) Ending claims 
 
 Claimants alleging first exposure before or during 1964 filed in: Texas Pennsylvania Other states that have enacted asbestos legislation Other states Total claims outstanding 
 
 The outstanding claims in each period exclude approximately inactive claims. Due to the passage of time, the Company considers it unlikely that the plaintiffs in these cases will pursue further action against the Company. The exclusion of these inactive claims had no effect on the calculation of the Company s accrual as the claims were filed in states, as described above, where the Company s liability is limited by statute. 
 
 With respect to claimants alleging first exposure to asbestos before or during 1964, the Company does not include in its accrual any amounts for settlements in states where the Company s liability is limited by statute except for certain pending claims in Texas as described earlier.

Crown Holdings, Inc. 

Pre-1965 claims in states without asbestos legislation 
 
 Crown Cork has entered into arrangements with plaintiffs counsel in certain jurisdictions with respect to claims which are not yet filed, or asserted, against it. However, Crown Cork expects claims under these arrangements to be filed or asserted against Crown Cork in the future. The projected value of these claims is included in the Company s estimated liability as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s accrual for pending and future asbestos-related claims and related legal costs was , including for unasserted claims. The Company determines its accrual without limitation to a specific time period. 
 
 It is reasonably possible that the actual loss could be in excess of the Company s accrual. However, the Company is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss in excess of its accrual due to uncertainty in the following assumptions that underlie the Company s accrual and the possibility of losses in excess of such accrual: the amount of damages sought by the claimant (which was not specified for approximately of the claims outstanding at the end of 2023), the Company and claimant s willingness to negotiate a settlement, the terms of settlements of other defendants with asbestos-related liabilities, the bankruptcy filings of other defendants (which may result in additional claims and higher settlements for non-bankrupt defendants), the nature of pending and future claims (including the seriousness of alleged disease, whether claimants allege first exposure to asbestos before or during 1964 and the claimant s ability to demonstrate the alleged link to Crown Cork), the volatility of the litigation environment, the defense strategies available to the Company, the level of future claims, the rate of receipt of claims, the jurisdiction in which claims are filed, and the effect of state asbestos legislation (including the validity and applicability of the Pennsylvania legislation to non-Pennsylvania jurisdictions, where the substantial majority of the Company s asbestos cases are filed). 

J. 
 
 for its share of estimated future remediation costs at these sites. The Company has been identified as having either directly or indirectly disposed of commercial or industrial waste at the sites subject to the accrual, and where appropriate and supported by available information, generally has agreed to be responsible for a percentage of future remediation costs based on an estimated volume of materials disposed in proportion to the total materials disposed at each site. The Company has not had monetary sanctions imposed nor has the Company been notified of any potential monetary sanctions at any of the sites. 
 
 The Company has also recorded aggregate accruals of for remediation activities at various worldwide locations that are owned by the Company and for which the Company is not a member of a PRP group. Although the Company believes its accruals are adequate to cover its portion of future remediation costs, there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments will not exceed the amount of the Company s accruals and will not have a material effect on its results of operations, financial position and cash flow. Any possible loss or range of potential loss that may be incurred in excess of the recorded accruals cannot be estimated. 
 
 In March 2015, the Bundeskartellamt, or German Federal Cartel Office FCO ), conducted unannounced inspections of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including a German subsidiary of the Company. The local court order authorizing the inspection cited FCO suspicions of anti-competitive agreements in the German market for the supply of metal packaging products. The Company conducted an internal investigation into the matter and discovered instances of inappropriate conduct by certain employees of German subsidiaries of the Company. The

. Fining decisions based on settlements can be appealed under EU law and the Company sought annulment of the Commission s fining decision on the basis that the referral of the case from the FCO to the Commissio n was unjustified. In October 2024, the General Court of the EU issued a judgment dismissing the Company s appeal. The Company is considering an appeal of the General Court s judgment to the European Court of Justice. If the Company does decide to appeal the judgement, there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of such appeal. 
 
 In March 2017, U.S. Customs and Border Protection CBP at the Port of Milwaukee issued a penalty notification alleging that certain of the Company s subsidiaries intentionally misclassified the importation of certain goods into the U.S. during the period 2004 -2009. CBP initially assessed a penalty of . The Company has acknowledged to CBP that the goods were misclassified and has paid all related duties, which CBP does not dispute. The Company has asserted that the misclassification was unintentional and disputes the penalty assessment by CBP. CBP has brought suit in the U.S. Court of International Trade seeking enforcement of the initial penalty against the Company. At the present time, based on the information available, the Company does not believe that a loss for the alleged intentional misclassification is probable. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in contesting the assessed penalty. 
 
 On October 7, 2021, the French Autorit de la concurrence (the French Competition Authority or FCA issued a statement of objections to 14 trade associations, one public entity and 101 legal entities from 28 corporate groups, including the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, other leading metal can manufacturers, certain can fillers and certain retailers in France. The FCA alleged violations of Articles 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and L.420-1 of the French Commercial Code. The statement of objections alleges, among other things, anti-competitive behavior in connection with the removal of bisphenol-A from metal packaging in France. The removal of bisphenol-A was mandated by French legislation that went into effect in 2015. On December 29, 2023, the FCA issued a decision imposing a fine of million on the Company. The Company has appealed the decision of the FCA, however there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of such appeal. 
 
 In June 2024, the Brazilian Federal Tax Authorities issued an assessment against the Company's Brazilian subsidiary in relation to the use of PIS and COFINS indirect tax credits arising from a favorable judicial decision received by the Company in 2019. The assessment disallowed credits of taken by the Co mpany for the years 2004 through 2015 when the PIS and COFINS indirect taxes were calculated by fixed rates and assessed interest and penalties. The Company does not believe that a loss for this assessment is probable and plans to challenge the assessment at the administrative and judicial level, if necessary. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in contesting the assessment. 
 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to various other lawsuits and claims with respect to labor, environmental, securities, vendor and other matters arising out of the Company s normal course of business. While the impact on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists, management believes that the ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the Company s consolidated earnings, financial position or cash flow. The Company has various commitments to purchase materials, supplies and utilities as part of the ordinary conduct of business. At times, the Company guarantees the obligations of subsidiaries under certain of these contracts and is liable for such arrangements only if the subsidiary fails to perform its obligations under the contract. 
 
 The Company s basic raw materials for its products are aluminum and steel, both of which are purchased from multiple sources. The Company is subject to fluctuations in the cost of these raw materials and has periodically adjusted its selling prices to reflect these movements. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to fully recover any increases or fluctuations in raw material costs from its customers. The Company also has commitments for standby letters of credit and for purchases of capital assets. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company was party to certain indemnification agreements covering environmental remediation, lease payments and other potential costs associated with properties sold or businesses divested. The

 The extent to which the Company uses such instruments is dependent upon its access to these contracts in the financial markets and its success using other methods, such as netting exposures in the same currencies to mitigate foreign exchange risk, using sales agreements that permit the pass-through of commodity price and foreign exchange rate risk to customers and borrowing both fixed and floating debt instruments to manage interest rate risk. 
 
 For derivative financial instruments accounted for in hedging relationships, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the manner in which effectiveness will be assessed. The Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the hedging relationships are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. When a forecasted transaction is reasonably possible, but not probable of occurring, the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and the change in fair value from the date of the last effectiveness test is recognized in earnings. Any gain or loss which has accumulated in other comprehensive income at the date of the last effectiveness test is reclassified into earnings at the same time of the underlying exposure or when the forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring. 
 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 
 The Company designates certain derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges. No components of the hedging instruments are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Changes in fair value of outstanding derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until earnings are impacted by the hedged transaction. Classification of the gain or loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations

 The Company uses commodity forward contracts to hedge anticipated purchases of various commodities, primarily aluminum as well as natural gas and electricity, and these exposures are hedged by a central treasury unit. 
 
 The Company also designates certain foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency denominated sales or purchases. The Company manages these risks at the operating unit level. Often, foreign currency risk is hedged together with the related commodity price risk. 
 
 The Company may also use interest rate swaps to convert interest on floating rate debt to a fixed-rate. ) ) Commodities ) ) ) ) ) ) ) Amount of gain/(loss) reclassified from AOCI into income Amount of gain/(loss) reclassified from AOCI into income Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Derivatives in cash flow hedges 2024 2023 2024 2023 Affected line items in the Statement of Operations Commodities ) ) Net sales Foreign exchange ) Cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization Commodities ) ) Cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization ) ) ) ) Income before taxes and equity in net earnings of affiliates Provision for income taxes ) ) ) ) Net income

 Fair Value Hedges and Contracts Not Designated as Hedges 
 
 The Company designates certain derivative financial instruments as fair value hedges of recognized foreign-denominated assets and liabilities, generally trade accounts receivable and payable and unrecognized firm commitments. The notional values and maturity dates of the derivative instruments coincide with those of the hedged items. Changes in fair value of the derivative financial instruments, excluding time value, are offset by changes in fair value of the related hedged items. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss of and a gain of , respectively, from foreign exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges. For the three and nine months ended

Crown Holdings, Inc. 

and a loss of from foreign exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges. These adjustments were reported within foreign exchange in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Certain derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange contracts related to intercompany debt, were not designated or did not qualify for hedge accounting; however, they are effective economic hedges as the changes in their fair value, except for time value, are offset by changes arising from re-measurement of the related hedged items. The Company s primary use of these derivative instruments is to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies. Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are immediately recognized in earnings as foreign exchange adjustments.

 Net Investment Hedges 
 
 The Company designates certain debt and derivative instruments as net investment hedges to manage foreign currency risk relating to net investments in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies and reduce the variability in the functional currency equivalent cash flows. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded losses of , net of tax) and , net of tax) in other comprehensive income for certain debt instruments that are designated as hedges of its net investment in a euro-based subsidiary. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded gains of , net of tax) and , net of tax) in other comprehensive income for certain debt instruments that are designated as hedges of its net investment in a euro-based subsidiary. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cumulative gains of , net of tax) and , net of tax) were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these net investment hedges and the carrying amount of the hedging instrument was approximately at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company also has cross-currency swaps with an aggregate notional values of designated as hedges of the Company's net investment in a euro-based subsidiary. These swaps mature in 2026 and reduced interest expense by and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. ) )

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 (dollars in millions) 
 
 Introduction 
 
 The following discussion presents management's analysis of the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 and changes in financial condition and liquidity from December 31, 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, along with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in and referred to within this report. 
 
 Business Strategy and Trends 
 
 The Company's strategy is to maximize long-term shareholder value by pursuing profitable growth opportunities while returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
 
 Global industry demand for beverage cans has been growing in recent years in North America, Brazil, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Growth has been driven by new product introductions in North America, customer and consumer focus on the sustainability benefits of aluminum, and population and GDP growth in many markets. To meet such demand, the Company made long-term investments of approximately 2,000 for new manufacturing facilities and additional production lines in existing facilities since 2021. In 2023, the impact of higher inflation and interest rates slowed growth in many markets. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects to have the ability to meet current and future demand growth with its current installed capital base and expects capital spending to be no more than 450 in 2024. 
 
 The Company's strategy is anchored by strong cash flow generation and a healthy balance sheet with a long-term net leverage ratio target of 2.5x adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure). The Company believes it has the flexibility and resources to fund growth, repay debt and return excess cash flow to shareholders in the future. On July 25, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an aggregate amount of 2,000 of the Company's common stock through the end of 2027. The new authorization supersedes the previous authorization announced in December 2021, which authorized the repurchase of an aggregate amount of 3,000 of Company common stock through the end of 2024. 
 
 The Company continues to actively elevate its commitment to sustainability, which is a core value of the Company. In 2020, the Company introduced Twenty by 30 , a robust program that outlines twenty measurable, science based, environmental, social and governance goals to be completed by 2030. In September 2021, the Company joined The Climate Pledge, a commitment to be net-zero carbon across business operations by 2040. 
 
 To date the war between Russia and Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East have not had a direct material impact on the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 
 The Company continues to actively manage the challenges of supply chain disruptions, foreign exchange, interest rate fluctuations, and inflationary pressures, including increasing costs for raw materials, energy and transportation. The Company generally attempts to mitigate aluminum and steel price risk by matching its purchase obligations with its sales agreements. Additionally, the Company attempts to mitigate inflationary pressures on energy and raw material costs with contractual pass-through provisions that include annual selling price adjustments based on price indices. The Company also uses commodity forward contracts to manage its exposure to raw material costs. The ability to mitigate inflationary risks through these measures varies by region and the impact on the results of the Company s segments is discussed, as applicable, in the heading "Results of Operations" below. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 The key measure used by the Company in assessing performance is segment income, a non-GAAP measure defined by the Company as income from operations adjusted to exclude intangibles amortization charges, restructuring and other and the impact of fair value adjustments to inventory acquired in an acquisition.

Crown Holdings, Inc. 

The foreign currency translation impacts referred to in the discussion below were primarily due to changes in the Mexican peso in the Company's Americas Beverage segment, the euro and pound sterling in the Company's European Beverage segment, the Thai baht in the Company's Asia Pacific segment. The Company's Transit Packaging segment is a global business and the foreign currency translation impacts referred to in the discussion below are primarily related to the Indian rupee, the Japanese yen and the Brazilian real. 
 
 The Company calculates the impact of foreign currency translation by dividing current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiplying those amounts by the applicable prior year average exchange rates.

 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 
 
 Net sales decreased primarily due to 214 from the pass-through of lower aluminum, steel and other commodity costs and lower shipments in Asia Pacific, Transit Packaging and Other segments, partially offset by higher beverage can shipments in the Americas and European Beverage segments. 
 
 Americas Beverage 
 
 The Americas Beverage segment manufactures aluminum beverage cans and ends, steel crowns, glass bottles and aluminum closures and supplies a variety of customers from its operations in the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Colombia and Mexico. 
 
 The U.S. and Canadian beverage can markets have experienced growth in recent years due to the introduction of new beverage products in cans versus other packaging formats. In Brazil and Mexico, the Company's volumes have increased in recent years primarily due to market growth driven by increased per capita incomes and consumption, combined with an increased preference for cans over other forms of beverage packing. 
 
 To meet volume requirements in these markets, the Company added a new greenfield facility in Mesquite, Nevada in 2023. 
 
 Net sales and segment income in the Americas Beverage segment were as follows: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net sales 1,368 1,295 3,915 3,848 Segment income 280 232 712 621

Crown Holdings, Inc. 

Segment income increased primarily due to higher shipments and improved manufacturing performance, including lower start-up costs compared to 2023. 
 
 European Beverage 
 
 The Company's European Beverage segment manufactures aluminum beverage cans and ends and supplies a variety of customers from its operations throughout Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. In recent years, the European beverage can market has been growing due to a market shift to cans versus other packaging formats. To meet volume requirements, in 2023 the Company added additional line capacity in Agoncillo, Spain, a new greenfield facility in Peterborough, U.K. and acquired Helvetia Packaging AG, a beverage can and end manufacturing facility in Saarlouis, Germany. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recast its segment reporting to reclassify European corporate costs that were previously included in Corporate and other unallocated items in the European Beverage segment. Prior periods were recast to conform to the new presentation. 
 
 Net sales and segment income in the European Beverage segment were as follows: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net sales 573 536 1,615 1,547 Segment income 86 73 225 181

 Asia Pacific 
 The Company's Asia Pacific segment consists of beverage can operations in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam and non-beverage can operations, primarily food cans and specialty packaging. Historically, growth in the beverage can market in Southeast Asia has been driven by increased per capita incomes and consumption, combined with an increased preference for cans over other forms of beverage packaging. 
 
 In 2023, volume softness was noted across each country in the Asia Pacific segment as the region continued to struggle with the effects of higher inflation and interest rates. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company announced the closure of its beverage can facilities in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and Singapore with capacity relocated to the Company's Vung Tau, Vietnam facility. 
 
 In June 2022, the Company's Yangon, Myanmar beverage can plant was temporarily idled due to currency restrictions, which resulted in the inability to source U.S. dollars required to procure U.S. dollar raw materials. The Company began production on a limited basis in 2023 and had net sales of 6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Property, plant and equipment in Myanmar as of September 30, 2024 was 49, including 24 of land and buildings and 25 of machinery and equipment. The Company will continue to monitor the economic conditions and the impact to its business in Myanmar, including any alternative uses for its machinery and equipment.

 Corporate and unallocated expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher incentive compensation, including stock-based compensation. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 The Company periodically reviews the useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Based on the Company s experience with the duration over which equipment and buildings of its aluminum beverage can business can be utilized, the Company engaged a third-party appraiser to assist in this review and, as a result, increased the estimated useful lives of buildings up to 50 years and machinery and equipment up to 23 years effective January 1, 2024. The change in accounting estimate will be applied on a prospective basis. The change in useful lives resulted in a net reduction in depreciation expense of 16 and 48 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the amount of depreciation expense that would have been recorded by utilizing the prior depreciable lives. 
 
 Restructuring and other, net

The Company continually evaluates its cost structure and is currently evaluating the potential closure of a plant which has property, plant and equipment of 25 as of September 30, 2024. This action may also result in charges for severance and other exit costs. 
 
 Other pension and postretirement 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other pension and postretirement expense included settlement charges of 517 related to the transfer of portions of the Company's Canadian and primary U.S. defined

Crown Holdings, Inc. 

benefit pension liabilities through the purchase of group annuity insurance contracts. See Note M for more information. 
 
 Taxes on income 
 
 The Company's effective income tax rates were as follows: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income before taxes and equity in net earnings of affiliates (177) 252 222 652 Provision for income taxes (39) 62 55 163 Effective income tax rate 22.0 24.6 24.8 25.0 
 
 The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023, was primarily due to the tax benefit from the pension settlement charges taken during the quarter, offset by an increase in earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions. 
 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was comparable to 2023, as the tax benefit from the pension settlement charges and the benefit of 16 taken in 2024 related to the release of a valuation allowance resulting from improved profitability in a European subsidiary were offset by an increase in earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2024, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have enacted the Pillar II directive which establishes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 initiated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Company does not expect Pillar II to have a material impact on its financial results, including its annual estimated effective tax rate or liquidity for 2024. 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023, net income from noncontrolling interests increased primarily due to higher earnings in the Company's beverage can operations in Brazil. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased from 832 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 897 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher income from operations and working capital improvements, partially offset by higher pension contributions related to the settlement of a portion of the U.S. pension plan. 
 
 Days sales outstanding for trade receivables, excluding the impact of unbilled receivables, decreased from 32 days as of September 30, 2023 to 29 days at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Inventory turnover decreased from 67 days at September 30, 2023 to 60 days at September 30, 2024, primarily due to efforts to reduce inventory levels across most businesses. 
 
 Days outstanding for trade payables increased from 78 days at September 30, 2023 to 93 days at September 30, 2024 primarily due t o lower purchases in 2023 as a result of prior year inventory builds. 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used for investing activities decreased from 520 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 208 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to lower capital expenditures.

Crown Holdings, Inc. 

Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used for financing activities increased from 35 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 260 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to payments of long-term debt and common stock repurchased in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 In August 2024, the Company issued 600 principal amount of 4.50 senior unsecured notes due 2030 and used the proceeds to pay down the 600 principal amount of 2.625 senior unsecured notes due September 2024.

 Liquidity 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 1,229 of the Company's 1,738 of cash and cash equivalents was located outside the U.S. The Company is not currently aware of any legal restrictions under foreign law that materially impact its access to cash held outside the U.S. The Company funds its cash needs in the U.S. through a combination of cash flows from operations, dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and the acceleration of cash receipts under its receivable securitization and factoring facilities. Of the cash and cash equivalents located outside the U.S., 433 was held by subsidiaries for which earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. 
 
 The Company's revolving credit agreements provide capacity of 1,650 and as of September 30, 2024, the Company had available capacity of 1,613. The Company could have borrowed this amount at September 30, 2024 and still have been in compliance with its leverage ratio covenants. 
 
 The Company's debt agreements contain covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends or repurchase capital stock, make certain other restricted payments, create liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. These restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions, however, which allow the Company to incur additional debt, create liens or make otherwise restricted payments provided that the Company is in compliance with applicable financial and other covenants and meets certain liquidity requirements. 
 
 The Company s revolving credit facilities and term loan facilities also contain a total leverage ratio covenant. The leverage ratio is calculated as total net debt divided by Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement). Total net debt is defined in the credit agreement as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated as the sum of, among other things, net income attributable to Crown Holdings, net income attributable to certain of the Company's subsidiaries, income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and certain non-cash charges. The Company s total net leverage ratio of 2.9 to 1.0 at September 30, 2024 was in compliance with the covenant requiring a ratio no greater than 4.5 to 1.0. The ratio is calculated at the end of each quarter using debt and cash balances as of the end of the quarter and Consolidated EBITDA for the most recent twelve months. Failure to meet the financial covenant could result in the acceleration of any outstanding amounts due under the revolving credit facilities and term loan facilities. 
 
 In order to reduce leverage and future interest payments, the Company may from time to time repurchase outstanding notes and debentures with cash or seek to refinance its existing credit facilities and other indebtedness. The Company will evaluate any such transactions in light of any required premiums and then existing market conditions and may determine not to pursue such transactions. 
 
 The Company s current sources of liquidity also include a securitization facility with a program limit up to a maximum of 800 that expires in July 2025 and securitization facilities with program limits of 230 and 160 that expire in November 2025. 
 
 The Company utilizes its cash flows from operations, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and the acceleration of cash receipts under its receivables securitization and factoring programs to primarily fund its operations, capital expenditures and financing obligations.

 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
 
 Information regarding the Company's commitments and contingent liabilities appears in Part I within Item 1 of this report under Note J , entitled Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the consolidated financial statements, and in Part II within Item 1A of this report which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions. 
 
 Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, impacting the reported results of operations and financial condition of the Company. Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note A to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Updates to the Company's accounting policies related to new accounting pronouncements, as applicable, are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Forward Looking Statements 
 
 Statements included herein, including, but not limited to, those in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the discussions of asbestos in Note I and commitments and contingencies in Note J to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and also in Part I, Item 1, Business and Item 3, Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion 
 34 

Crown Holdings, Inc. 

and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are not historical facts (including any statements concerning the direct or indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts in the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war, objectives of management for share repurchases, dividends, future operations or economic performance, or assumptions related thereto, including the potential for higher interest rates and energy prices), are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, the Company and its representatives may, from time to time, make oral or written statements which are also forward-looking statements. 
 
 These forward-looking statements are made based upon management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the Company and, therefore, involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Management cautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. 
 
 While the Company periodically reassesses material trends and uncertainties affecting the Company's results of operations and financial condition in connection with the preparation of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and certain other sections contained in the Company's quarterly, annual or other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), the Company does not intend to review or revise any particular forward-looking statement in light of future events. 
 
 A discussion of important factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of the Company to differ from expectations has been set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 within Part II, Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption Forward Looking Statements and is incorporated herein by reference. Some of the factors are also discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q (including under Item 1A of Part II below) and in prior Company filings with the SEC. In addition, other factors have been or may be discussed from time to time in the Company's SEC filings. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 In the normal course of business the Company is subject to risk from adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates and commodity prices. The Company manages these risks through a program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily swaps and forwards. Counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties. These instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. The extent to which the Company uses such instruments is dependent upon its access to these contracts in the financial markets and its success in using other methods, such as netting exposures in the same currencies to mitigate foreign exchange risk and using sales arrangements that permit the pass-through of commodity prices and foreign exchange rate risks to customers. The Company's objective in managing its exposure to market risk is to limit the impact on earnings and cash flow. For further discussion of the Company's use of derivative instruments and their fair values at September 30, 2024, see Note K to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 2.3 billion principal floating interest rate debt and 1.4 billion of securitization and factoring. A change of 0.25 in these floating interest rates would change annual interest expense by approximately 9 million before tax. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation and as of the end of the quarter for which this report is made, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Disclosure controls and procedures ensure that information to be disclosed in reports that the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and terms of the SEC, and ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 35 

There has been no change in internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
