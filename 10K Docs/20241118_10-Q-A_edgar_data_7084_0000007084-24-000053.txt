 Included in raw materials and supplies are work in process inventories which were not material as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Cost Method Investments 
 
 Cost method investments of million and million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were included in Other Assets in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Revaluation losses of million in the six months ended June 30, 2024 were related to an investment in alternative protein and precision fermentation, partially offset by an upward adjustment of million in the six months ended June 30, 2024. There were revaluation gains or losses in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. Revaluation gains and losses are recorded in interest and investment income in the Company s consolidated statements of earnings. As of June 30, 2024, the cumulative amounts of upward and downward adjustments were million and million, respectively. 
 
 Investments in Affiliates 
 
 The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, including its investment in Wilmar International Limited Wilmar ). The Company s investment in Wilmar had a carrying value of billion as of June 30, 2024, and a market value of billion based on the quoted Singapore Exchange market price converted to U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate at June 30, 2024. Wilmar does not have a recent history of operating losses, has positive working capital and positive cash flows and has a long history of paying dividends. 
 
 A significant portion of the decline in market value of Wilmar based on the quoted Singapore Exchange market price occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Company considers its investment in Wilmar a significant and strategic relationship and has the intent and ability to retain its investment in Wilmar for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. 
 
 Based on the evaluation of the factors above and the Company s evaluation of the near-term prospects of Wilmar in relation to the severity and duration of the decline in fair value, the Company does not consider the investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired at June 30, 2024.

 The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment generates revenue from the sale of commodities, from service fees for the transportation of goods, from the sale of products manufactured in its global processing facilities, and from its structured trade finance activities. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract.

For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the mode of transportation moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of Topic 606. The amount of revenue recognized follows the contractually specified price, which may include freight or other contractually specified cost components. For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by Topic 610-20.

The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration specified in the contract, which could include freight and other costs depending on the specific shipping terms of each contract. For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by Topic 610-20.

 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements (Continued) 

 Unrealized derivative gains: Commodity contracts Foreign currency contracts Cash equivalents Segregated investments Total Assets Liabilities: Unrealized derivative losses: Commodity contracts Foreign currency contracts Inventory-related payables Total Liabilities 
 
 Estimated fair values for inventories and inventory-related payables carried at market are based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets and quality, referred to as basis. Market valuations for the Company s inventories are adjusted for location and quality (basis) because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts with standardized terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery location, and commodity quality or grade. The basis adjustments are generally determined using the inputs from competitor and broker quotations or market transactions and are considered observable. Basis adjustments are impacted by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market. Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the movement of these basis adjustments. In some cases, the basis adjustments are unobservable because they are supported by little to no market activity. When unobservable inputs have a significant impact (more than 10 on the measurement of fair value, the inventory is classified in Level 3. Changes in the fair value of inventories and inventory-related payables are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. 
 
 Derivative contracts include exchange-traded commodity futures and options contracts, forward commodity purchase and sale contracts, and over-the-counter (OTC) instruments related primarily to agricultural commodities, energy, interest rates, and foreign currencies. Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified in Level 1. Substantially all of the Company s exchange-traded futures and options contracts are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in these tables. Fair value for forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is estimated based on exchange-quoted prices adjusted for differences in local markets. Market valuations for the Company s forward commodity purchase and sale contracts are adjusted for location (basis) because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts that have standardized terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery location, and commodity quality or grade. The basis adjustments are generally determined using inputs from competitor and broker quotations or market transactions and are considered observable. Basis adjustments are impacted by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market. Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the movement of these basis adjustments. In some cases, the basis adjustments are unobservable because they are supported by little to no market activity. When observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the contract, it is classified in Level 2. When unobservable inputs have a significant impact (more than 10 on

 Transfers into Level 3 of assets and liabilities previously classified in Level 2 were due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts rising above the 10 threshold. Transfers out of Level 3 were primarily due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts falling below the 10 threshold and thus permitting reclassification to Level 2. 
 
 In some cases, the price components that result in differences between exchange-traded prices and local prices for inventories and commodity purchase and sale contracts are observable based upon available quotations for these pricing components, and in some cases, the differences are unobservable. These price components primarily include transportation costs and other adjustments required due to location, quality, or other contract terms. In the table below, these other adjustments are referred to as basis. The changes in unobservable price components are determined by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market. Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the movement of these unobservable price components.

 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in the rate was primarily due to the impact of discrete tax items, partially offset by the change in the geographic mix of forecasted pretax earnings. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s Pillar Two initiative introduced a 15 global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis that has been enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Company operates, with effective dates starting in fiscal year 2024. The Company is in scope of the enacted legislation and has performed an assessment of the potential exposure based on its most recent tax filings, country-by-country reporting, and the financial results of the constituent entities. Based on the assessment, the effective tax rates in most of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates are above the 15 global minimum tax threshold. However, there are a limited number of jurisdictions where the effective tax rate is close to 15 . ADM does not expect a material liability to global minimum tax in those jurisdictions. 
 
 The Company is subject to income taxation and routine examinations in many jurisdictions around the world and frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing, nature, and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In its routine evaluations of the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company recognizes a liability, when necessary, for

ADM Ireland Receivables transfers certain of the purchased accounts receivable to each of the Second Purchasers together with a security interest in all of its right, title, and interest in the remaining purchased accounts receivable. In exchange, ADM Ireland Receivables receives a cash payment of up to billion billion) for the accounts receivables transferred. The Second Program terminates on April 18, 2025, unless extended. 
 
 Under the First and Second Programs (collectively, the Programs ), ADM Receivables and ADM Ireland Receivables use the cash proceeds from the transfer of receivables to the First Purchasers and Second Purchasers (collectively, the Purchasers and other consideration, as applicable, to finance the purchase of receivables from the Company and the ADM subsidiaries originating the receivables. The Company accounts for these transfers as sales. The Company acts as a servicer for the transferred receivables. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility, based on its assessment of the servicing fee, market values for similar transactions, and its cost of servicing the receivables sold.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 As described in the Explanatory Note above and in Part I, Item 1, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has restated its Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 contained in this Amendment. As a result, the previously reported financial information as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, in this Item 2. MD A has been updated to reflect the relevant restatements. See Item 1, Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Restatement of Previously Filed Consolidated Financial Statements, and Note 13. Segment Information, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the restatements, including descriptions of the adjustments and the impacts on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The Company also is correcting certain segment disclosure presentation errors. In this Amendment, the Company is revising its reconciliation and calculation of total segment operating profit. The revised reconciliation in Note 13. Segment Information presents a subtotal for total segment operating profit that is equal to the sum of the segment operating profit reported for each of the Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition segments. Amounts for other business and specified items, which previously were reflected in the calculation of total segment operating profit, are now reflected as reconciling items, similar to Corporate, between total segment operating profit and earnings before income taxes. 
 
 Company Overview 
 
 ADM is an essential global agricultural supply chain manager and processor; a premier human and animal nutrition provider; a trailblazer in groundbreaking solutions to support healthier living; an industry-leading innovator in replacing petroleum-based products; and a leader in sustainability. The Company is one of the world s leading producers of ingredients for sustainable nutrition. The Company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities, connecting to markets in over 190 countries. The Company also processes corn, oilseeds, and wheat into products for food, animal feed, industrial, and energy uses. The Company also engages in the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of a wide array of ingredients and solutions including plant-based proteins, natural flavors, flavor systems, natural colors, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, probiotics, prebiotics, enzymes, botanical extracts, and other specialty food and feed ingredients. The Company uses its global asset network, business acumen, and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for its shareholders, principally from margins earned on these activities. 
 
 The Company s operations are organized, managed, and classified into three reportable business segments: Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered. The Company s remaining operations are not reportable business segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other Business. Financial information with respect to the Company s reportable business segments is set forth in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 herein, Financial Statements . 
 
 ADM s recent significant portfolio actions and announcements include: 
 
 the acquisitions in January 2024 of Revela Foods, a Wisconsin-based developer and manufacturer of innovative dairy flavor ingredients and solutions and FDL, a UK-based leading developer and producer of premium flavor and functional ingredient systems. 
 
 Sustainability is a key driver in ADM s expanding portfolio of environmentally responsible, plant-derived products. Consumers today increasingly expect their food and drink to come from sustainable ingredients, produced by companies that share their values, and ADM is continually finding new ways to meet those needs through its portfolio actions. 
 
 The Company s strategic transformation is focused on three strategic pillars: Productivity, Innovation, and Culture. 
 
 The Productivity pillar includes (1) partnering across various global teams including procurement, supply chain, operations, and commercial to optimize costs and improve production volumes across the enterprise; (2) continued roll out of the 1ADM 
 40 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 business transformation program and implementation of improved standardized business processes; and (3) increased use of technology, data analytics, and automation at production facilities, in offices, and with customers to improve efficiencies and customer service. 
 
 The Innovation pillar includes expansions and investments in (1) improving the customer experience by leveraging producer relationships and enhancing the use of state-of-the-art digital technology; (2) sustainability-driven innovation, which encompasses the full range of products, solutions, capabilities, and commitments to serve customers needs; and (3) growth initiatives, including organic growth with additional capacity to meet growing market demand and strategic objectives. 
 
 The Culture pillar focuses on building capabilities and enabling collaboration, teamwork, and agility from process standardization and digitalization and ADM s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, which bring new perspectives and expertise to the Company s decision-making. 
 
 ADM plans to support the three pillars with investments in technology, which include expanding digital capabilities and investing further in research and development. 
 
 Environmental and Social Responsibility 
 
 The Company s policy to protect forests, biodiversity, and communities includes provisions that promote conservation of water resources and biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, promote solutions to reduce climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and support agriculture as a means to advance sustainable development by reducing poverty and increasing food security. Additionally, the policy confirms ADM s commitment to protect human rights defenders, whistleblowers, complainants, and community spokespersons; ADM s aspiration to cooperate with all parties necessary to enable access to fair and just remediation; and the Company s non-compliance protocol for suppliers. In 2022, the Company achieved full traceability of its direct and indirect sourcing throughout its soy supply chains in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. ADM is committed to eliminating deforestation from all of the Company s supply chains by 2025. In 2023, after a strategic investigation of the impact of conversion of native habitats in its key supply chains, the Company announced its commitment to eliminate conversion of native habitats in high risk areas in South America for direct suppliers of all commodities by 2025 and indirect suppliers by 2027, with a 2025 cutoff date (a date after which conversion of primary native vegetation renders a given area or production unit non-compliant) for both direct and indirect suppliers. 
 
 The Company s environmental goals, collectively called Strive 35 an ambitious plan to, by 2035, reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 25 percent from a 2019 baseline, reduce Scope 3 emissions by 25 from a 2021 baseline, reduce energy intensity by 15 percent from a 2019 baseline, reduce water intensity by 10 percent from a 2019 baseline, and achieve a 90 percent landfill diversion rate. In 2023, ADM refined two of its Strive 35 commitments to more meaningfully drive progress: ADM aims to reduce its absolute water withdrawal by 10 , from a 2019 baseline, by 2035, and ADM aims to increase its use of low-carbon energy sources to 25 of total energy used by 2035. 
 
 Operating Performance Indicators 
 
 The Company is exposed to certain risks inherent to an agricultural-based commodity business. These risks are further described in Part I Item 1A, Risk Factors included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company s Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials. As a result, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold. Therefore, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to changes in margins or gross profit. Thus, gross margins per volume or metric ton are more meaningful than gross margins as percentage of revenues. 
 
 The Nutrition businesses also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold. Therefore, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit. Thus, gross margins rates are more meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses. 
 
 41 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 70 countries. For the majority of the Company s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except for certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland where Euro is the functional currency, and Brazil and Argentina where U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. For the majority of the Company s business activities in Brazil and Argentina, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency. Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the Company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar. Effective April 1, 2022, the Company changed the functional currency of its Turkish entities to the U.S. dollar which did not and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), gross margins, segment operating profit, total segment operating profit, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, return on invested capital, economic value added, and operating cash flows before working capital. Some of these metrics are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. For more information, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 46 . The Company s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, trade policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, global production of similar and competitive crops, and geopolitical developments. Due to the unpredictable nature of these and other factors, the Company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Market Factors Influencing Operations or Results in the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 
 
 The Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's operating results. In Ag Services and Oilseeds, following two years of very favorable market conditions, several headwinds in the agriculture cycle led to more normalized conditions throughout the entire value chain. Ag Services experienced slow South American farmer selling, depressed margins, low demand for North American exports along with limited trade opportunities as a carry market has contributed to slow farmer selling. Crushing saw good demand with lower North American meal exports. In Refined Products and Other, despite strong global demand for oil and biodiesel, margins were limited by oil values, particularly in North America, due to low carbon intensity feedstocks competing in the renewable diesel market. In Carbohydrate Solutions, demand for starches and sweeteners remained solid with margins remaining steady across the entire portfolio. Demand for ethanol was strong going into summer driving season. Strong ethanol export demand was due to higher mandates in certain jurisdictions and discretionary blending. Industry ethanol stocks declined and ethanol margins improved. In Nutrition, demand was softer in a few food and beverage product categories driven by shifts in consumer discretionary spend. Human Nutrition was impacted by inflation which drove lower demand and impacted sales volumes in alternative proteins. In Animal Nutrition, a soft amino acids market driven by price weakness in North America was partially compensated by a slightly improved market in Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). The global feed and feed additives market remained challenged on the demand side, with weakness in the Chinese beef and pork business and continued subdued global shrimp prices. 
 
 Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 
 
 Earnings before income taxes decreased 536 million from 1.1 billion to 596 million due to lower pricing and execution margins as well as higher Corporate costs. Total segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) decreased 617 million from 1.5 billion to 925 million due primarily to lower results in Ag Services and Oilseeds, and Human Nutrition, partially offset by higher results in Carbohydrate Solutions, Other Business, and Animal Nutrition. Total segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) excluded asset impairment and restructuring charges totaling 7 million. Excluded from total segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) in the prior-year quarter was a net charge of 103 million consisting of charges totaling 114 million and a gain on the sale of certain assets of 11 million. Corporate results in the current quarter were a net charge of 418 million. Corporate results in the prior-year quarter were a net charge of 393 million and included a mark-to-market gain of 1 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. 
 
 Income tax expense decreased 89 million to 115 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was 19.3 compared to 18.0 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The increase in the rate was primarily due to the impact of discrete tax items, partially offset by the change in the geographic mix of forecasted pretax earnings.

Analysis of Statements of Earnings 
 
 Processed volumes by product for the quarter were as follows (in metric tons): 
 Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change Oilseeds 8,872 8,783 89 Corn 4,482 4,448 34 Total 13,354 13,231 123 
 
 The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. Oilseeds and corn processed volumes were fairly consistent between the quarters with increases due to more favorable weather and reduced unplanned downtime compared to the previous year. 
 
 Revenues by segment for the quarter were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Change (In millions) Ag Services and Oilseeds Ag Services 11,746 13,366 (1,620) Crushing 2,850 3,480 (630) Refined Products and Other 2,737 2,998 (261) Total Ag Services and Oilseeds 17,333 19,844 (2,511) Carbohydrate Solutions Starches and Sweeteners 2,211 2,475 (264) Vantage Corn Processors 683 906 (223) Total Carbohydrate Solutions 2,894 3,381 (487) Nutrition Human Nutrition 1,061 966 95 Animal Nutrition 847 887 (40) Total Nutrition 1,908 1,853 55 Total Segment Revenues 22,135 25,078 (2,943) Other Business 113 112 1 Total Revenues 22,248 25,190 (2,942) 
 
 Revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes. During periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins because both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Ag Services and Oilseeds, generally have a relatively equal impact from market price changes, which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit. 
 43 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Revenues decreased 2.9 billion to 22.2 billion due to lower sales prices 3.6 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes 0.7 billion). Lower sales prices of emulsifiers and thickeners, biodiesel, and corn and lower sales volumes of meal and farming materials, were partially offset by higher sales volumes of animal feeds, oils, soybeans and rapeseed. Ag Services and Oilseeds revenues decreased 13 to 17.3 billion due to lower sales prices 3.1 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes 0.6 billion). Carbohydrate Solutions revenues decreased 14 to 2.9 billion due to lower sales prices 0.5 billion). Nutrition revenues increased 3 to 1.9 billion due to slightly higher sales volumes 0.2 billion), partially offset by lower prices 0.1 billion). 
 
 Cost of products sold decreased 2.5 billion to 20.9 billion due principally to lower average commodity costs. Manufacturing expenses increased 20 million to 1.9 billion due principally to higher salaries and benefit costs, maintenance costs, and commercial services, partially offset by lower energy costs. 
 
 Foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 114 million and cost of products sold by 95 million. 
 
 Gross profit decreased 0.5 billion or 26 to 1.4 billion. Lower results in Ag Services and Oilseeds 507 million), and Human Nutrition 54 million) were partially offset by higher results in Carbohydrate Solutions 32 million), Animal Nutrition 24 million), and Other 20 million). These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 4 5 . 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 66 million to 907 million due primarily to increased legal and professional fees, increased amortization of intangibles, and higher salaries and benefit costs. 
 
 Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs decreased 53 million to 7 million. Charges in the current quarter consisted of 7 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets presented as specified items. Charges in the prior-year quarter consisted of 43 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets and intangibles and 17 million of restructuring, presented as specified items. 
 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased 1 million to 152 million due primarily to higher earnings from the Company s investments in Hungrana, Almindones Mexicanos S.A., and Stratas, partially offset by lower earnings from the Company s investment in Wilmar. 
 
 Interest and investment income decreased 2 million to 140 million due primarily to lower interest income. 
 
 Interest expense increased 7 million to 187 million due primarily to increased short-term rates on customer deposit balances in ADM Investor Services. Interest expense in the prior-year quarter also included a mark-to-market gain adjustment of 1 million related to the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. 
 
 Other income-net decreased 28 million to 9 million. Income in the current quarter included gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, the non-service components of net pension benefit income, net foreign exchange gains, and net other income. Income in the prior-year quarter included gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, the non-service components of net pension benefit income, net foreign exchange gains, and net other income.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Total segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) is reconciled to earnings before income taxes, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 as follows: 
 
 Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Change (In millions) Earnings before income taxes 596 1,132 (536) Other Business (earnings) loss (96) (86) (10) Corporate 418 393 25 Specified Items: Gains on sale of assets (11) 11 Impairment and restructuring charges 7 114 (107) Total Segment Operating Profit 925 1,542 (617) Segment Operating Profit Ag Services and Oilseeds Ag Services 122 380 (258) Crushing 132 224 (92) Refined Products and Other 137 362 (225) Wilmar 68 88 (20) Total Ag Services and Oilseeds 459 1,054 (595) Carbohydrate Solutions Starches and Sweeteners 323 301 22 Vantage Corn Processors 34 18 16 Total Carbohydrate Solutions 357 319 38 Nutrition Human Nutrition 103 185 (82) Animal Nutrition 6 (16) 22 Total Nutrition 109 169 (60) 
 
 Ag Services and Oilseeds segment operating profit decreased 56 . Ag Services results were lower than the second quarter of 2023 due to the stabilization of trade flows leading to lower global trade and risk management results. In South America, slower farmer selling led to much lower margins. North American results were lower due to strong supplies out of Brazil and Argentina shifting export demand to South America. Crushing results were lower than the prior year quarter as global soy crush margins moderated due to more balanced supply and demand conditions and lower oil values caused by an increase in imports of used cooking oil. During the quarter, negative mark-to-market timing impacts were significantly lower than in the prior-year quarter. Refined Products Other (RPO) results were lower, as the margin structure in North America and EMEA has eased from historically high levels in the prior year period. RPO negative mark-to-market timing impacts affected current quarter results versus positive impacts in the prior-year quarter. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Carbohydrate Solutions segment operating profit increased 12 . Starches and Sweeteners results were higher year-over-year as strong starches and sweeteners margins and higher volumes were partially offset by lower domestic ethanol margins, as well as moderating margins in the EMEA region. Vantage Corn Processors results improved year-over-year as strong demand for exports of ethanol supported higher margins . 
 45 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Nutrition segment operating profit decreased 36 . Human Nutrition results were lower than the second quarter of 2023 as impacts related to unplanned downtime at Decatur East, a normalizing texturants market, and higher manufacturing costs negatively impacted margins. Animal Nutrition results were higher compared to the same quarter last year as cost optimization efforts and lower input costs bolstered margins. 
 
 Other Business operating profit increased 10 million. Captive insurance results were higher due to lower claim activity. ADM Investor Services was lower on higher operating costs. 
 
 Corporate results for the quarter were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Change (In millions) Interest expense-net (128) (125) (3) Unallocated corporate costs (292) (262) (30) Expenses related to acquisitions (4) (3) (1) Gain on debt conversion option 1 (1) Restructuring charges (3) 3 Other income (expense) 6 (1) 7 Total Corporate (418) (393) (25) 
 
 Corporate results were a net charge of 418 million in the current quarter compared to a net charge of 393 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense-net increased 3 million due to higher borrowings. Unallocated corporate costs increased 30 million due primarily to increases in legal and professional fees, global technology spend, and securitization fees. Gain on debt conversion option in the prior-year quarter was related to the mark-to-market adjustment of the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. Other income in the current quarter includes foreign exchange gains of 12 million and the non-service components of net pension benefit income of 5 million. Other expense in the prior-year quarter included foreign exchange losses and railroad maintenance expenses, partially offset by the non-service components of net pension benefit income of 5 million. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The Company uses adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and total segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to evaluate the Company s financial performance. These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. 
 
 Adjusted net earnings is defined as net earnings adjusted for the effects on net earnings of specified items. Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of specified items. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest on borrowings, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest on borrowings, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest on borrowings, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for specified items. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of income tax expense, interest expense on borrowings and depreciation and amortization to net earnings. Total segment operating profit is defined as ADM s consolidated earnings before income taxes, adjusted for Other business, Corporate, and specified items. 
 
 Management believes that adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and total segment operating profit are useful measures of the Company s performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and total segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to net earnings, diluted EPS and earnings before income taxes, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP. The table on page 4 5 provides a reconciliation of total segment operating profit to earnings before income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

 In this Amendment, the Company is revising its reconciliation and calculation of total segment operating profit. The revised reconciliation in Note 13. Segment Information presents a subtotal for total segment operating profit that is equal to the sum of the segment operating profit reported for each of the Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition segments. Amounts for other business and specified items, which previously were reflected in the calculation of total segment operating profit, are now reflected as reconciling items, similar to Corporate, between total segment operating profit and earnings before income taxes.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Market Factors Influencing Operations or Results in the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 
 
 The Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's operating results. In Ag Services and Oilseeds, following two years of very favorable market conditions, several headwinds in the agriculture cycle led to more normalized results throughout the entire value chain. Ag Services experienced slow South American farmer selling, low demand for North American exports, with good crop prospects in North America. Crushing experienced strong run rates in Europe and South America, the anticipation of a more normal global supply environment, and new capacity suppressing meal and oil values. In Refined Products and Other, oil values in North America were under pressure due to low carbon intensity feedstocks competing in the renewable diesel market, nevertheless the biodiesel mandate increase from B12 to B14 in Brazil had a positive impact on results. In Carbohydrate Solutions, demand for starches and sweeteners remained solid with margins remaining steady across the entire portfolio. Strong export demand for ethanol helped offset higher industry production to minimize the imbalance between supply and demand. In Nutrition, demand was softer in a few food and beverage product categories driven by shifts in consumer discretionary spend. Human Nutrition was impacted by inflation which drove lower demand and impacted sales volumes in alternative proteins. Demand has started to recover in the food, beverage, and dietary supplement segment. In Animal Nutrition, a soft amino acids market driven by price weakness in North America was partially compensated by a slightly improved market in Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). The global feed and feed additives market remained challenged on the demand side, with weakness in the Chinese beef and pork business and continued subdued global shrimp prices. 
 
 Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 
 
 Earnings before income taxes decreased 1.0 billion from 2.5 billion to 1.5 billion due to lower pricing and execution margins as well as higher Corporate costs. Total segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) decreased 1.0 billion to 2.1 billion due primarily to lower results in Crushing, Refined Products and Other, Ag Services, Human Nutrition, and Starches and Sweeteners, partially offset by higher results in Wilmar, Vantage Corn Processors, and Animal Nutrition. Total segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) excluded a net charge of 13 million consisting of asset impairment charges totaling 13 million. Excluded from the total segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) in the prior period was a net charge of 109 million consisting of charges totaling 121 million related to the impairment of certain assets, restructuring, and a contingency/settlement, partially offset by gains on the sale of certain assets of 12 million. Corporate results in the current period were a net charge of 0.8 billion. Corporate results in the prior period were a net charge of 0.7 billion and included a mark-to-market gain of 6 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. The bonds were paid off in full, as scheduled, in August 2023. 
 
 Income taxes of 281 million decreased 148 million. The Company s effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 19.0 compared to 17.0 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in the rate was primarily due to the impact of discrete tax items, partially offset by the change in the geographic mix of forecasted pretax earnings.

 The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. The overall increase in oilseeds processed volumes was primarily related to improved crush rates in South America and EMEA compared to lower crush rates in the prior year due to inclement weather, unplanned downtime, and reduced capacity due to the Russian-Ukraine war. In addition, plant reliability has increased slightly year over year. 
 
 Revenues by segment for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

 Revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes. During periods of significant changes in commodity prices, management believes that margins can be a helpful indicator of the Company s underlying performance because both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Ag Services and Oilseeds, generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes, which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit. 
 
 Revenues decreased 5.2 billion to 44.1 billion due to lower sales prices 8.5 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes 3.4 billion). Lower sales prices of oils, soybeans, corn, and meal, and lower sales volumes of milled rice and alcohol, were partially offset by higher sales volumes of soybeans, wheat, oils and corn. Ag Services and Oilseeds revenues decreased 10 to 34.6 billion due to lower sales prices 7.4 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes 3.6 billion). Carbohydrate Solutions revenues decreased 19 to 5.6 billion due to lower sales prices 1.2 billion) and lower sales volumes 0.2 billion). Nutrition revenues increased 1 to 3.7 billion due to higher volumes 0.1 billion), partially offset by lower prices 0.1 billion). 
 
 49 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Cost of products sold decreased 4.3 billion to 41.0 billion due principally to lower average commodity costs. Manufacturing expenses decreased 0.1 billion to 3.7 billion due principally to decreases in energy costs, and operating supplies, partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits, legal, professional, and other fees, and commercial services. 
 
 Foreign currency translation decreased revenues and cost of products sold by 50 million and 32 million, respectively. 
 
 Gross profit decreased 0.9 billion or 23 to 3.1 billion due principally to lower results in Ag Services and Oilseeds 870 million), Human Nutrition 102 million), and Starches and Sweeteners 35 million), partially offset by Animal Nutrition 44 million), Vantage Corn Processors 24 million), and Other 37 million). These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 5 1 . 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 0.1 billion to 1.9 billion due primarily to higher salaries and benefit costs, increased expenses for contracted outside labor, and higher legal and financing fees, partially offset by decreased provisions for bad debt. 
 
 Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs decreased 42 million to 25 million. Charges in the current period consisted of 10 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets, and 4 million of restructuring, presented as specified items, and 11 million of restructuring in Corporate. Charges in the prior period consisted of 46 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets and intangible assets and 21 million of restructuring, presented as specified items. 
 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased 39 million to 364 million due primarily to higher earnings from the Company s investments in Almindones Mexicanos S.A., Wilmar, Skyland Grain, LLC, and Hungrana Kft., partially offset by lower earnings from ADM s investment in SoyVen, Olenex Sarl, and Stratas. 
 
 Interest and investment income decreased 13 million to 263 million due primarily to a valuation loss related to an investment in alternative protein and precision fermentation, partially offset by higher interest income driven by higher interest rates. 
 
 Interest expense increased 26 million to 353 million due primarily to increased short-term rates on customer deposit balances in ADM Investor Services. Interest expense in the prior period included a 6 million mark-to-market gain adjustment related to the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. The exchangeable bonds were paid off in full in August 2023. 
 
 Other income-net decreased 46 million to 35 million. Income in the current period included gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, the non-service components of net pension benefit income, and net foreign exchange gains. Income in the prior period included gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, the non-service components of net pension benefit income, net foreign exchange gains, and net other income.

 Total segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) is reconciled to earnings before income taxes, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 as follows: 
 
 Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Change (In millions) Earnings before income taxes 1,481 2,529 (1,048) Other Business (earnings) loss (217) (183) (34) Corporate 844 715 129 Specified Items: Gains on sale of assets (12) 12 Impairment and restructuring charges 13 121 (108) Total Segment Operating Profit 2,121 3,170 (1,049) Ag Services and Oilseeds Ag Services 354 728 (374) Crushing 445 651 (206) Refined Products and Other 307 689 (382) Wilmar 217 197 20 Total Ag Services and Oilseeds 1,323 2,265 (942) Carbohydrate Solutions Starches and Sweeteners 584 614 (30) Vantage Corn Processors 21 (16) 37 Total Carbohydrate Solutions 605 598 7 Nutrition Human Nutrition 179 323 (144) Animal Nutrition 14 (16) 30 Total Nutrition 193 307 (114) 
 
 Ag Services and Oilseeds segment operating profit decreased 42 . Ag Services results are down from the prior period. South America Origination margins have compressed due to slower farmer selling and increased freight costs. North America Origination continues to see weak export demand and a carry market has contributed to slow farmer selling limiting trade opportunities. Execution in destination marketing as well as effective risk management continued to deliver strong Global Trade results, though lower than the prior year. Crushing results were lower than the prior period, particularly in North America. Increased industry capacity pressured Crush margins and increased supply of competing low carbon intensity feedstocks affected margins. Board crush rallied the end of the quarter due to industry downtime, strong product demand and ample supply. Refined Products and Other results are down from the prior period. North America margins compressed due to increased used cooking oil imports. Europe biodiesel benefited from high spot margins due to supply shortage. Wilmar earnings are higher versus the prior period. 
 
 Carbohydrate Solutions segment operating profit increased 1 . Starches and Sweeteners results were lower year-over-year on moderating margins in the EMEA region and lower domestic ethanol margins due to strong industry production that were offset in part by strong starches and sweeteners margins. Vantage Corn Processors results improved year-over-year as strong demand for exports of ethanol supported volumes and margins.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Nutrition segment operating profit decreased 37 . Human Nutrition results were lower than the prior period, as impacts related to unplanned downtime at Decatur East, and a normalizing texturants market negatively impacted margins. Animal Nutrition results were higher compared to the prior period, as amino acids market recovery, cost optimization efforts and lower input costs bolstered margins. 
 
 Other Business operating profit increased 34 million. Captive insurance results were higher due to lower claim activity. ADM Investor Services profits were lower on higher operating costs. 
 
 Corporate results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Change (In millions) Interest expense-net (238) (228) (10) Unallocated corporate costs (596) (510) (86) Expenses related to acquisitions (4) (3) (1) Gain on debt conversion option 6 (6) Restructuring (charges) (12) (3) (9) Other income 6 23 (17) Total Corporate (844) (715) (129) 
 
 Corporate results were a net charge of 0.8 billion in the current period compared to a net charge of 0.7 billion in the prior period. Interest expense-net increased 10 million due primarily to increased short-term rates on the Company s commercial paper borrowing programs and increased interest expense from new debt issuances. Unallocated corporate costs increased 86 million due primarily to increases in legal and professional fees, global technology spend, and securitization fees. Gain on debt conversion option in the prior period was related to the mark-to-market adjustment of the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. Other income in the current period included the non-service components of net pension benefit income of 9 million and foreign exchange gains of 27 million, partially offset by railroad maintenance expenses of 4 million. This was offset by valuation losses of approximately 18 million in the Company s ADM Ventures portfolio. Other income in the prior period included the non-service components of net pension benefit income of 9 million, and foreign exchange gains, partially offset by railroad maintenance expenses. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The Company uses adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and total segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to evaluate the Company s financial performance. These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. 
 
 Adjusted net earnings is defined as net earnings adjusted for the effects on net earnings of specified items. Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of specified items. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest on borrowings, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest on borrowings, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for specified items. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of income tax expense, interest expense on borrowings and depreciation and amortization to net earnings. Total segment operating profit is defined as ADM s consolidated earnings before income taxes, adjusted for Other business, Corporate, and specified items. 
 
 Management believes that adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and total segment operating profit are useful measures of the Company s performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and total segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to net earnings, diluted EPS and earnings before income taxes, the most directly comparable amounts reported under

 GAAP. The table on page 5 1 provides a reconciliation of total segment operating profit to earnings before income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 In this Amendment, the Company is revising its reconciliation and calculation of total segment operating profit in Note 13. Segment Information. The revised reconciliation in Note 13. Segment Information presents a subtotal for total segment operating profit that is equal to the sum of the segment operating profit reported for each of the Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition segments. Amounts for other business and specified items, which previously were reflected in the calculation of total segment operating profit, are now reflected as reconciling items, similar to Corporate, between total segment operating profit and earnings before income taxes. 
 
 The table below provides a reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings and diluted EPS to adjusted EPS for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital-intensive agricultural commodity-based business. The Company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of ADM s control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures. The primary source of funds to finance ADM s operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility and accounts receivable securitization programs. In addition, the Company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both U.S. and international markets. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to cash provided of 0.9 billion for the same period last year. Working capital changes decreased cash by 0.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to a decrease of 1.6 billion for the same period last year. Segregated investments increased 0.3 billion due to increased trading activity in the Company s futures commission and brokerage business. Trade receivables increased 0.2 billion due to timing of sales. Inventories decreased 1.4 billion due to lower inventory prices and volumes. Trade payables decreased 1.3 billion primarily due to lower payables related to grain purchases. Brokerage payables decreased approximately 0.4 billion due to decreased trading activity in the Company s futures commission and brokerage business. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 1.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 0.6 billion for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2024 of 0.7 billion were comparable to the same period last year. Net assets of businesses acquired in the six months ended June 30, 2024 were 0.9 billion compared to none in the same period last year. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities was 0.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to cash used of 2.1 billion for the same period last year. Long-term debt payments were immaterial for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 0.7 billion for the same period last year, due to no corporate bond issues coming due in the current year period, compared to one issue coming due in the prior year period. Net borrowings on short-term credit agreements for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were 2.2 billion compared to net payments of 0.4 billion for the same period last year. Share repurchases for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were 2.3 billion compared to 1.0 billion for the same period last year. Dividends were 0.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 0.5 billion for the same period last year. 
 
 At June 30, 2024, the Company had 0.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.4 to 1. Included in working capital was 5.7 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. At June 30, 2024, the Company s capital resources included shareholders equity of 22.2 billion and lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs described below, totaling 12.3 billion, of which 7.8 billion was unused. The Company s ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt of 8.2 billion and shareholders equity of 22.2 billion in 2024 and the sum of long-term debt of 8.3 billion and shareholders equity of 24.1 billion in 2023) was 27 and 25 at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company uses this ratio as a measure of the Company s long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility. The Company s ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt of 2.3 billion, current maturities of long-term debt of 1 million, and long-term debt of 8.2 billion less the sum of cash and cash equivalents of 0.8 billion and short-term marketable securities of none in 2024 and the sum of short-term debt of 0.1 billion, current maturities of long-term debt of 1 million, and long-term debt of 8.3 billion less the sum of cash and cash equivalents of 1.4 billion and short-term marketable securities of none in 2023) to capital (the sum of net debt of 9.8 billion and shareholders equity of 22.2 billion in 2024 and the sum of net debt of 7.0 billion and shareholders' equity of 24.1 billion in 2023) was 31 and 22 at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the Company s total lines of credit, 5.0 billion supported the combined U.S. and European commercial paper borrowing programs, against which there was 1.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding at June 30, 2024. 
 
 As of June 30, 2024, the Company had 0.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, 0.5 billion of which was cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on the Company s historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations and unused and available U.S. credit capacity of 5.0 billion, the Company has asserted that these funds are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. 
 
 The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the Programs with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. The Programs provide the Company with up to 2.8 billion in funding against accounts 
 54

 receivable transferred into the Programs and expands the Company s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 herein, Financial Statements for more information and disclosures on the Programs). As of June 30, 2024, the Company had 0.7 billion unused capacity of its facility under the Programs. 
 
 As of June 30, 2024, the Company has total available liquidity of 8.6 billion comprised of cash and cash equivalents and unused lines of credit with a well-diversified group of primarily investment-grade institutions. 
 
 For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company spent approximately 0.7 billion in capital expenditures, 0.5 billion in dividends, and 2.3 billion in share repurchases. The Company has a stock repurchase program. On March 12, 2024, the Company entered into an ASR Agreement with Merrill Lynch International, an affiliate of BofA Securities, Inc., to repurchase 1.0 billion of ADM common stock as part of ADM s existing share repurchase program to repurchase up to 200 million shares through December 31, 2024. On March 28, 2024, the Company received an interim delivery of 8,880,986 shares at an average share price of 60.596 or 538 million. On April 15, 2024, the Company received a final delivery of 7,325,733 shares as final settlement of the ASR transaction (see Notes 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 herein, Financial Statements for more information). As of June 30, 2024, the Company had 14.8 million shares remaining that may be repurchased under the program until December 31, 2024. 
 
 In 2024, the Company expects total capital expenditures of approximately 1.4 billion and additional cash outlays of approximately 1.0 billion in dividends and 2.3 billion in share repurchases, subject to other strategic uses of capital and the evolution of operating cash flows and the working capital position throughout the year. 

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 
 The Company s purchase obligations as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 12.7 billion and 14.0 billion, respectively. The decrease is primarily related to lower energy commitments. As of June 30, 2024, the Company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations of 11.9 billion within the next twelve months. There were no other material changes in the Company s contractual obligations during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 There were no material changes in the Company s off balance sheet arrangements during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 There were no material changes in the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. For a description of the Company s critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company s financial statements, see Part II, Item 7 and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 The market risk inherent in the Company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Company s net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. Significant changes in market risk sensitive instruments and positions for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 are described below. There were no material changes during the period in the Company s potential loss arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
 
 For detailed information regarding the Company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 55 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) 

 Commodities 
 
 The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in customer preferences and standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. 
 
 The fair value of the Company s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period, where available, or utilizing a close proxy. The Company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure, which consist of volumetric limits and value-at-risk (VaR) limits. VaR measures the potential loss, at a 95 confidence level, that could be incurred over a one-year period. Volumetric limits are monitored daily and VaR calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly. 
 
 In addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices (assuming no correlations) over a one-year period using VaR, sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices. The highest, lowest, and average weekly position together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10 adverse price change is as follows: 
 Six Months Ended Year ended June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Long/(Short) (In millions) 
 Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk Highest position 543 54 498 50 Lowest position (265) (27) (6) (1) Average position 75 8 125 13 
 
 The change in fair value of the average position was due to the overall decrease in average quantities, partially offset by the increase in prices of certain commodities. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 At the time of the filing of this Amendment, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )), as of June 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2024, due to the material weakness described below. 
 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 As disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, during the fourth quarter of 2023, in connection with the Investigation, the Company identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the Company s accounting practices and procedures for segment disclosures. The material weakness resulted from inadequate controls that allowed for certain intersegment sales to be reported at amounts that were not in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Specifically, the Company did not have adequate controls in place around measurement of certain intersegment sales between the Company s reporting segments. In addition, appropriate controls were not in place for the reporting of intersegment sales and for the application of disclosure requirements within ASC 280, Segment Reporting . The absence of adequate controls with respect to the reporting of intersegment sales impacted the completeness and accuracy of the Company s segment disclosures and review controls over projected financial information utilized in goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment tests. 
 
 Remediation Plan 
 
 The Company is implementing enhancements to its internal controls to remediate the identified material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the Company s accounting practices and procedures for intersegment sales and to enhance the reliability of its financial statements with respect to the pricing and reporting of such sales. Specifically, the 
 56 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (Continued) 

Company is: (i) enhancing the Company s accounting policies with respect to the measurement of intersegment sales; (ii) improving and documenting the Company s pricing guidelines for intersegment sales; (iii) enhancing the design and documentation of the execution of pricing and measurement controls, including as to the completeness and accuracy of the reporting for intersegment sales disclosure purposes and projected financial information used in impairment analyses; and (iv) increasing training for relevant personnel on the measurement of and application of relevant accounting guidance to intersegment sales and segment disclosures. 
 
 While the Company believes that these efforts will improve its internal control over financial reporting, the Company will not be able to conclude whether the steps the Company is taking will remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting until a sustained period of time has passed to allow management to test the design and operational effectiveness of the new and enhanced controls. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company is implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The Company did not have any further deployments of the ERP system during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Except for the material weakness described above and the related remediation measures that are being implemented, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company completed the acquisitions of Revela, FDL, PT, and TNS. As a result of the acquisitions, the Company is in the process of reviewing the internal control structures of these businesses and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes as the Company incorporates its controls and procedures into the acquired businesses. 
 57 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 10, Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 herein, Financial Statements, for information on income tax matters), and class actions. The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of its business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution. The outcomes of these matters are not within the Company s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice. The Company s estimated loss or range of loss with respect to loss contingencies may change from time to time, and it is reasonably possible the Company will incur actual losses in excess of the amounts currently accrued and such additional amounts may be material. While the Company continues to work with parties with respect to potential resolution, no assurance can be given that it will be successful in doing so and the Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters. See Note 17, Legal Proceedings of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 herein, Financial Statements, for information on the Company s legal proceedings which is incorporated herein by reference.
