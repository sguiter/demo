 Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses. million and million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The deposits are held in various commercial banks with a total of million and million exceeding the FDIC s deposit insurance limits at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, as well as at the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Des Moines and Chicago. and are carried at cost.

 pools, which are homogeneous groups of loans that possess similar loss potential characteristics. The Company primarily utilizes the discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology for measurement of the required ACL. For a limited number of pools with a relatively small balance of unpaid principal, the Company utilizes the remaining life method. The DCF model implements probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) calculations at the instrument level. PD and LGD are determined based on statistical analysis and correlation of historical losses with

There was impairment of goodwill at September 30, 2024. million with million accumulated amortization, gross other identifiable intangibles of million with accumulated amortization of million, and mortgage and SBA servicing rights of million. At June 30, 2024, the Company s intangible assets included gross core deposit intangibles of million with million accumulated amortization, gross other identifiable intangibles of million with accumulated amortization of million, and mortgage and SBA servicing rights of million. The Company s core deposit and other intangible assets are being amortized , in accordance with ASC 350, over periods ranging from five to , with amortization expense expected to be approximately million in the remainder of fiscal 2025, million in fiscal 2026, million in fiscal 2027, million in fiscal 2028, million in fiscal 2029, and million thereafter. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, there was impairment of other intangible assets indicated. In come Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance (ASC 740, Income Taxes). The income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. The Company determines deferred income taxes using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management s judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, on income taxes as a component of income tax expense. The Company files consolidated income tax returns with its subsidiaries, the Bank and SB Real Estate Investments, LLC, with a tax year ended June 30. Southern Bank Real Estate Investments, LLC files a separate REIT return for federal tax purposes, and also files state income tax returns, with a tax year ended December 31.

 loans totaling million, as compared to loans totaling million at June 30, 2024. 1-4 Residential Real Estate Lending. The Company actively originates loans for the acquisition or refinance of one- to four-family residences. This category includes both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage ARM loans amortizing over periods of up to , and the properties securing such loans may be owner-occupied or non-owner-occupied. Single-family residential loans do not generally exceed of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price of the secured property. Substantially all of the one- to four-family residential mortgage originations in the Company s portfolio are located within the Company s primary lending area. General risks related to one- to four-family residential lending include stability of borrower income and collateral values. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are secured with a deed of trust and are generally issued up to of the appraised or estimated value of the property securing the line of credit, less the outstanding balance on the first mortgage and are typically issued for a term of . Interest rates on HELOCs are generally adjustable. Interest rates are based upon the loan-to-value ratio of the property with better rates given to borrowers with more equity. Risks related to HELOC lending generally include the stability of borrower income and collateral values. Non-Owner Occupied and Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate Lending. The Company actively originates loans secured by owner- and non-owner-occupied commercial real estate including single- and multi-tenant retail properties, restaurants, hotels, land (improved and unimproved), nursing homes and other healthcare facilities, warehouses and distribution centers, convenience stores, automobile dealerships and other automotive-related services, and other businesses. These properties are typically owned and operated by borrowers headquartered within the Company s primary lending area, however, the property may be located outside the Company s primary lending area. Approximately million of the Company s billion in commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located outside our primary lending area. Risks to owner-occupied commercial real estate lending generally include the continued profitable operation of the borrower s enterprise, as well as general collateral values, and may be heightened by unique, specific uses of the property serving as collateral. Non-owner-occupied commercial real estate lending risks include tenant demand and performance, lease rates, and vacancies, as well as collateral values and borrower leverage. These factors may be influenced by general economic conditions in the region, or in the United States generally. Most commercial real estate loans originated by the Company generally are based on amortization schedules of up to with monthly principal and interest payments. Generally, the interest rate received on these loans is fixed for a maturity for up to , with a balloon payment due at maturity. Alternatively, for some loans, the interest rate adjusts at least annually after an initial period up to . The Company typically includes an interest rate floor in the loan agreement. Generally, improved commercial real estate loan amounts do not exceed of the lower of the appraised value or the purchase price of the secured property. Multi-family Real Estate Lending. The Company originates loans secured by multi-family residential properties that are often located outside the Company s primary lending area but made to borrowers who operate within the Company s primary market area. The majority of the multi-family residential loans that are originated by the Company are amortized over periods generally up to , with balloon maturities typically up to . Both fixed and adjustable interest rates are offered and it is typical for the Company to include an interest rate floor and ceiling in the loan agreement. Generally, multi-family residential loans do not exceed of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price of the secured property. General risks related to multi-family residential lending include rental demand and supply, rental rates, and vacancies, as well as collateral values and borrower leverage. Construction and Land Development Lending. The Company originates real estate loans secured by property or land that is under construction or development. Construction and land development loans originated by the Company are generally to finance the construction of owner occupied residential real estate, or to finance speculative construction of residential real estate, land development, or owner-operated or non-owner occupied commercial real estate. During construction, these loans typically require monthly interest-only payments, with single-family residential construction loans having maturities ranging from six to twelve months , while multi-family or commercial construction loans typically mature in to . Once construction is completed, construction loans may be converted to permanent

 on residential and generally up to s on commercial real estate. Construction and land development lending risks generally include successful timely and on-budget completion of the project, followed by the sale of the property in the case of land development or non-owner-occupied real estate, or the long-term occupancy of the property by the builder in the case of owner-occupied construction. Changes in real estate values or other economic conditions may impact the ability of a borrower to sell property developed for that purpose. While the Company typically utilizes relatively short maturity periods to closely monitor the inherent risks associated with construction loans for these loans, weather conditions, change orders, availability of materials and/or labor, and other factors may contribute to the lengthening of a project, thus necessitating the need to renew the construction loan at the balloon maturity. Such extensions are typically executed in incremental three month periods to facilitate project completion. During construction, loans typically require monthly interest only payments which may allow the Company an opportunity to monitor for early signs of financial difficulty should the borrower fail to make a required monthly payment. Additionally, during the construction phase, the Company typically performs interim inspections which further provide the Company an opportunity to assess risk. Agriculture Production and Agriculture Real Estate Lending. Agriculture production and agriculture real estate loans are generally comprised on seasonal operating lines to farmers to plant crops and term loans to fund the purchase of equipment, farmland, or livestock. This segment of lending includes pastureland and row crop ground. The Company originates substantially all agriculture production and agriculture real estate lending to borrowers headquartered in the Company s primary lending area. Specific underwriting standards have been established for agricultural-related loans including the establishment of projections for each operating year based on industry developed estimates of farm input costs and expected commodity yields and prices. Agriculture production operating lines are typically written for and secured by the crop. Agricultural real estate terms offered usually have amortization schedules of up to with an 80 loan-to-value ratio, or with a 75 loan-to-value ratio. Risks to agricultural lending include unique factors such as commodity prices, yields, input costs, and weather, as well as farmland and farm equipment values. Commercial and Industrial Lending . The Company s commercial and industrial lending activities encompass loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and operating lines of credit. The Company offers both fixed and adjustable rate commercial and industrial loans. Generally, commercial loans secured by fixed assets are amortized over periods up to . Commercial and industrial lending risk is primarily driven by the borrower s successful generation of cash flow from their business enterprise sufficient to service debt, and may be influenced by factors specific to the borrower and industry, or by general economic conditions in the region or in the United States generally. Consumer Lending . The Company offers a variety of secured consumer loans, including home equity, direct and indirect automobile loans, second mortgages, recreational vehicle loans and loans secured by deposits. The Company originates substantially all of its consumer loans in its primary lending area. Usually, consumer loans are originated with fixed rates for terms of up to , with the exception of home equity lines of credit, which are variable, tied to the prime rate of interest and are for a period of . Automobile loans originated by the Company include both direct loans and a smaller amount of loans originated by auto dealers. Typically, automobile loans are made for terms of up to for new and used vehicles. Loans secured by automobiles have fixed rates and are generally made in amounts up to of the purchase price of the vehicle. Risks to automobile and other consumer lending generally include the stability of borrower income and borrower willingness to repay. Allowance for Credit Losses. The PCL for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was million compared to in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The current period PCL was the result of a million provision attributable to the ACL for loan balances outstanding, and a provision attributable to the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures. The Company has estimated its expected credit losses as of September 30, 2024, under ASC 326-20, and management believes the ACL as of that date was adequate based on that estimate. There remains, however, significant uncertainty as the Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy to address inflation risks. Qualitative adjustments in the Company s ACL model were slightly decreased compared to June 30, 2024. The Company increased the allowance attributable to classified hotel loans that have been slow to recover from

 (annualized) during the current period, as compared to for the same period of the prior fiscal year. Specifically, management considered the following primary qualitative items in its estimate of the ACL: economic conditions and projections as provided by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) were utilized in the Company s estimate at September 30, 2024. Economic factors considered in the projections included national levels of unemployment using the high bound of the FOMC s central tendency, and national rates of inflation-adjusted growth in the gross domestic product using the low bound of the FOMC s central tendency. Economic conditions are considered to be a moderate and stable risk factor, relative to June 30, 2024; the pace of growth of the Company s loan portfolio, exclusive of acquisitions, relative to overall economic growth. This measure is considered to be a moderate and slightly decreasing risk factor, relative to June 30, 2024; levels and trends for loan delinquencies nationally and in the region. This is considered to be a low and stable risk factor, relative to June 30, 2024; quantified supported model adjustments and general imprecision adjustments. This factor was added for the June 30, 2024, ACL estimate as certain model adjustments capture highly specific issues or events that are not adequately captured in model outcomes. General imprecision adjustments address other sources of imprecision that are not specifically identifiable or quantifiable to a particular loan portfolio and have not been captured by the model or by a specific model adjustment. The Company considers general imprecision in three dimensions; economic forecast imprecision, model imprecision, and process imprecision. PCD Loans. In connection with the acquisition of Citizens Bancshares Co. (Citizens) on January 20, 2023, and Fortune Financial Corporation (Fortune) on February 25, 2022, the Company acquired loans both with and without evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination. Acquired loans are recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition with no carryover from the acquired institution s previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses. Acquired loans are accounted for under ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. The fair value of acquired loans recorded at the time of acquisition is based upon several factors, including the timing and payment of expected cash flows, as adjusted for estimated credit losses and prepayments, and then discounting these cash flows using comparable market rates. The resulting fair value adjustment is recorded in the form of a premium or discount to the unpaid principal balance of the respective loans. As it relates to acquired loans that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, the net premium or net discount is adjusted to reflect the Company s allowance for credit losses recorded for PCD loans at the time of acquisition, and the remaining fair value adjustment is accreted or amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the respective loans. As it relates to loans not classified as PCD (non-PCD) loans, the credit loss and yield components of their fair value adjustment are aggregated, and the resulting net premium or net discount is accreted or amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the respective loans. The Company records an ACL for non-PCD loans at the time of acquisition through provision expense, and therefore, no further adjustments are made to the net premium or net discount for non-PCD loans. Loans that the Company acquired from Citizens and Fortune, that at the time of acquisition had more-than-insignificant deterioration of credit quality since origination, are classified as PCD loans and presented in the tables below at acquisition carrying value:

 Multi-family real estate Construction and land development Commercial and industrial Consumer Total gross charge-offs Credit Quality Indicators . The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on all loans at origination and is updated on a quarterly basis for loans risk rated Watch, Special Mention, Substandard, or Doubtful. In addition, lending relationships of million or more, exclusive of any consumer or owner-occupied residential loan, are subject to an annual credit analysis which is prepared by the loan administration department and presented to a loan committee with appropriate lending authority. A sample of lending relationships in excess of million (exclusive of single-family residential real estate loans) are subject to an independent loan review annually, in order to verify risk ratings. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Watch Loans classified as watch exhibit weaknesses that require more than usual monitoring. Issues may include deteriorating financial condition, payments made after due date but within 30 days, adverse industry conditions or management problems. Special Mention Loans classified as special mention exhibit signs of further deterioration but still generally make payments within 30 days. This is a transitional rating and loans should typically not be rated Special Mention for more than 12 months. Substandard Loans classified as substandard possess weaknesses that jeopardize the ultimate collection of the principal and interest outstanding. These loans exhibit continued financial losses, ongoing delinquency, overall poor financial condition, and insufficient collateral. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses of substandard loans, and have deteriorated to the level that there is a high probability of substantial loss. Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be Pass rated loans. A periodic review of selected credits (based on loan size and type) is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or probable losses and to assign risk grades. The primary responsibility for this review rests with loan administration personnel. This review is supplemented with periodic examinations of both selected credits and the credit review process by the Company s internal audit function and applicable regulatory agencies. The information from these reviews assists management in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and provides a basis for deciding whether the credit continues to share similar risk characteristics with collectively evaluated loan pools, or whether credit losses for the loan should be evaluated on an individual loan basis. The following table presents the credit risk profile of the Company s loan portfolio (excluding deferred loan fees) based on rating category and fiscal year of origination as of September 30, 2024. This table includes PCD loans, which are reported according to risk categorization after acquisition based on the Company s standards for such classification:

Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not adversely classified or determined to not share similar risk characteristics with collectively evaluated pools of loans for determination of the ACL estimate. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Significant payment delays or shortfalls may lead to a determination that a loan should be individually evaluated for estimated credit losses.

The Company elected certain relief options under ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), including the option not to recognize right of use asset and lease liabilities that arise from short-term leases (leases with terms of twelve months or less). At September 30, 2024, the Company had leased properties, which included banking facilities, administrative offices and ground leases, and numerous office equipment lease agreements in which it was the lessee, with lease terms exceeding twelve months. All of the Company s leases are classified as operating leases. These operating leases are included as a ROU asset in the premises and equipment line item on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The corresponding lease liability is included in the accounts payable and other liabilities line item on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. In the February 2022 acquisition of Fortune, the Company assumed a ground lease with an entity that is controlled by a Company insider. This property is in St. Louis County, MO and is in its fourth year of a term. ASU 2016-02 also requires certain other accounting elections. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, meaning those with terms under twelve months. ROU assets or lease liabilities are not to be recognized for short-term leases. The calculated amount of the ROU assets and lease liabilities in the table below are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used to present value the minimum lease payments. The Company s lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at the Company s discretion. If at lease inception, the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. Regarding the discount rate, the ASU requires the use of the rate implicit in the lease whenever this rate is readily determinable. As this rate is rarely determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception over a similar term. The expected lease terms range from to .

 PART I: Item 2 : Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations SOUTHERN MISSOURI BANCORP, INC. General Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc. (Southern Missouri or Company) is a Missouri corporation and owns all of the outstanding stock of Southern Bank (the Bank). The Company s earnings are primarily dependent on the operations of the Bank. As a result, the following discussion relates primarily to the operations of the Bank. The Bank s deposit accounts are generally insured up to a maximum of 250,000 by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At September 30, 2024, the Bank operated from its headquarters, 62 full-service branch offices, two limited-service branch offices, and two loan production offices. The Bank owns the office building and related land in which its headquarters are located, and 59 of its other branch offices. The remaining eight branches and offices are either leased or partially owned. The significant accounting policies followed by Southern Missouri and its wholly owned subsidiaries for interim financial reporting are consistent with the accounting policies followed for annual financial reporting. All adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature and are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported, have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2024, has been derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of that date. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the Company s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The following discussion reviews the Company s condensed consolidated financial condition at September 30, 2024, and results of operations for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Forward Looking Statements This document contains statements about the Company and its subsidiaries which we believe are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements with respect to anticipated future operating and financial performance, growth opportunities, interest rates, cost savings and funding advantages expected or anticipated to be realized by management. Words such as may, could, should, would, believe, anticipate, estimate, expect, intend, plan and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements by the Company and its management are based on beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, estimates and intentions of management and are not guarantees of future performance. The important factors we discuss below, as well as other factors discussed under the caption Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and identified in this filing and in our other filings with the SEC and those presented elsewhere by our management from time to time, could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this document: expected cost savings, synergies and other benefits from our merger and acquisition activities, including our recently completed acquisitions, might not be realized within the anticipated time frames, to the extent anticipated, or at all, and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention and labor shortages, might be greater than expected and goodwill impairment charges might be incurred;

 Critical Accounting Policies Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America are complex and require management to apply significant judgments to various accounting, reporting and disclosure matters. Management of the Company must use assumptions and estimates to apply these principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical. For a complete discussion of the Company s significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the form 10-Q. Certain policies are considered critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. Changes in such estimates may have a significant impact on the financial statements. Management has reviewed the application of these policies with the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. For a discussion of applying critical accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates beginning on page 62 in the Company s 2024 Annual Report. Executive Summary Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest margin, which is directly impacted by the interest rate environment. The net interest margin represents interest income earned on interest-earning assets (primarily real estate loans, commercial and agricultural loans, and the investment portfolio), less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities (primarily interest-bearing transaction accounts, certificates of deposit, savings and money market deposit accounts, and borrowed funds), as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin is directly impacted by the spread between long-term interest rates and short-term interest rates, as our interest-earning assets, particularly those with initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year, generally price off longer term rates while our interest-bearing liabilities generally price off shorter term interest rates. This difference in longer term and shorter term interest rates is often referred to as the steepness of the yield curve. A steep yield curve in which the difference in interest rates between short term and long term periods is relatively large could be beneficial to our net interest income, as the interest rate spread between our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities would be larger. Conversely, a flat or flattening yield curve, in which the difference in rates between short term and long term periods is relatively small or shrinking, or an inverted yield curve, in which short term rates exceed long term rates, could have an adverse impact on our net interest income, as our interest rate spread could decrease. Our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. During the first three months of fiscal 2025, total assets increased by 124.9 million. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in loans, net of the allowance for credit losses (ACL), and cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease in available-for-sale (AFS) securities. Loans, net of the ACL, increased 114.8 million; cash equivalents increased 14.4 million; and AFS securities decreased 7.7 million. Liabilities increased 108.0 million, as deposits increased 97.1 million; securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased 5.6 million; and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) increased 5.0 million. Equity increased 16.9 million, attributable primarily to earnings retained after cash dividends paid and a decrease of 6.9 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss as the market value of the Company s investments appreciated due to decreases in market interest rates. For more information, see Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. Net income for the first three months of fiscal 2025 was 12.5 million, a decrease of 693,000, or 5.3 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Compared to the year-ago period, the Company s decrease in net income was attributable to an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in provision for credit losses (PCL), partially offset by increases in net interest income and noninterest income. Diluted net income was 1.10 per common share for the first three months of fiscal 2025, as compared to 1.16 per common share for the same period of the prior fiscal year. For the first three months of fiscal 2025, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, net interest income increased 1.3 million, or 3.6 ; PCL increased 1.3 million, or 139.9 ; noninterest income increased 1.3 million, or 22.6 ; noninterest expense increased 2.1 million, or 9.0 ; and provision for income tax decreased 110,000, or 3.2 . During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company engaged with a consultant to complete a performance improvement project to enhance operations and revenues of the Bank. The one-time cost associated with this review totaled 840,000,

 reduced after-tax net income by 652,000, or 0.06 per fully diluted common share, and was a primary reason for the increase in non-interest expense and the decrease in net income during the current period. For more information see Results of Operations. Interest rates during the first three months of fiscal 2025 remained volatile and moved lower at the end of the period. As a result the yield curve remained inverted, with shorter-term obligations yielding more than longer-term obligations. However, the two-year part of the curve compared to the longer end of the curve uninverted, with a small positive slope. The Federal Reserve s Open Market Committee (FOMC) decreased the federal funds rate in September 2024, and market expectations are for additional reductions over the next year. At September 30, 2024, as compared to June 30, 2024, the yield on two-year treasuries decreased from 4.72 to 3.62 ; the yield on five-year treasuries decreased from 4.33 to 3.52 ; the yield on ten-year treasuries decreased from 4.34 to 3.74 ; and the yield on 30-year treasuries decreased from 4.50 to 4.08 . As compared to the first three months of the prior fiscal year, our average yield on earning assets increased by 54 basis points, primarily attributable to increases during the period in market interest rates at which earning assets were originated, or renewed, as well as a shift in the earning asset mix to loans receivable from cash and cash equivalents from year-ago levels. Our average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 70 basis points, as the Company increased offering rates on nonmaturity accounts and time deposits to adjust to the higher rate environment. Special deposit rates and brokered CD funding was utilized to fund loan growth as noninterest bearing and lower cost nonmaturity deposits decreased. The impact of the rapid increase in the level of short-term market interest rates over the prior two fiscal years, along with the yield curve inversion, caused our cost of funds to increase at a faster pace than our asset yields over prior periods. However, the September federal funds decrease, relatively stable price competition for deposits, and the increased percentage of our deposits that have already repriced in the current higher rate environment, in combination with new loan originations at higher market rates allowed the net interest margin to increase over the linked June 30, 2024, quarter, as upward pressure on deposit pricing has subsided and loan portfolio yields have continued to increase due to loan renewals and repricing, as well as new loan originations at higher long term rates. The Company s net income is also affected by the level of its noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income generally consists primarily of deposit account service charges, bank card interchange income, loan-related fees, earnings on bank-owned life insurance, gains on sales of loans, and other general operating income. Noninterest expense consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy-related expenses, data processing expense, telecommunications expense, deposit insurance assessments, professional fees, advertising, postage and office expenses, other insurance expenses, the amortization of intangible assets, and other general operating expenses. The Company s noninterest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 7.2 million, an increase of 1.3 million, or 22.6 , as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. In the current period, the increase was primarily attributable to increases in other loan fees, deposit account charges and related fees, bank card interchange income, and net realized gains on sale of loans. Net realized gains on sale of loans increased due to sales of Small Business Administration loans. These increases were partially offset by lower loan late charges, wealth management fees, and other noninterest income. Other noninterest income decreased primarily due to modest losses on the disposal of fixed assets, which were comprised of various equipment. Noninterest expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 25.8 million, an increase of 2.1 million, or 9.0 , as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. In the current quarter, this increase in noninterest expense was attributable primarily to increases in compensation and benefits, legal and professional fees, occupancy and equipment, and advertising expenses. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was primarily due to a trend increase in employee headcount, as well as annual merit increases. Legal and professional expenses increased primarily due to a one-time expense associated with a performance improvement project that started during the first fiscal quarter of 2025, as discussed above. This expense was fully realized in the September quarter, with only modest reimbursables remaining to be recognized in later quarters. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased primarily due to depreciation on recent capitalized expenditures, including buildings, equipment, and signage. Advertising activity in the current quarter increased marketing expenses compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year.

 We expect, over time, to continue to grow our assets through the origination and occasional purchase of loans, and purchases of investment securities. The primary funding for this asset growth is expected to come through deposits from retail and commercial clients, as well as public units. In addition, we will utilize brokered funding and short- and long-term FHLB borrowings. We have grown and intend to continue to grow deposits by offering desirable deposit products for our current customers and by attracting new depository relationships. We will also continue to explore strategic expansion opportunities in market areas that we believe will be attractive to our business model. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 The Company experienced balance sheet growth in the first three months of fiscal 2025, with total assets of 4.7 billion at September 30, 2024, reflecting an increase of 124.9 million, or 2.7 , as compared to June 30, 2024. Growth primarily reflected an increase in net loans receivable and cash equivalents and time deposits. Cash equivalents were 75.3 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 14.4 million, or 23.7 , as compared to June 30, 2024. AFS securities were 420.2 million at September 30, 2024, down 7.7 million, or 1.8 , as compared to June 30, 2024, as the Company was less active in reinvesting principal payments received. Loans, net of the ACL, were 3.9 billion at September 30, 2024, increasing by 114.8 million, or 3.0 , as compared to June 30, 2024. The Company noted growth in both the real estate and commercial portfolios. Real estate loan growth was primarily driven by drawn construction, 1-4 family residential, and owner occupied commercial real estate loan balances. This was somewhat offset by a decrease in loans secured by multi-family real estate. In the commercial portfolio, growth was driven by seasonal agricultural production loan draws and modest growth in commercial and industrial loan balances. Loans anticipated to fund in the next 90 days totaled 168.0 million at September 30, 2024, as compared to 157.1 million at June 30, 2024, and 158.2 million at September 30, 2023. Deposits were 4.0 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 97.1 million, or 2.5 , as compared to June 30, 2024. The deposit portfolio saw increases in certificates of deposit and savings accounts, as customers remained willing to move balances into high yield savings accounts and special rate time deposits during the higher rate environment. Public unit balances totaled 510.5 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 84.1 million compared to June 30, 2024, due to the Company losing the bid to retain a large local public unit depositor, and also experienced expected seasonal decreases in these accounts generally. Brokered deposits totaled 273.2 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 99.4 million compared to June 30, 2024. The Company increased brokered deposits in the quarter due to more attractive pricing for brokered certificates of deposits relative to local market rates and the need to fund seasonal loan demand. The average loan-to-deposit ratio for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 98.5 , as compared to 96.3 for the linked quarter. FHLB advances were 107.1 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 5.0 million, or 4.9 , from June 30, 2024, due to maturing advances which were not renewed. At both September 30 and June 30, 2024, the Company had no FHLB overnight borrowings at period end. The Company s stockholders equity was 505.6 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 16.9 million, or 3.5 , as compared to June 30, 2024. The increase was attributable primarily to earnings retained after cash dividends paid, in combination with a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive losses (AOCL) as the market value of the Company s investments appreciated due to decreases in market interest rates. The AOCL decreased from 17.4 million at June 30, 2024, to 10.6 million at September 30, 2024. The Company does not hold any securities classified as held-to-maturity.

Net income for the first three months of fiscal 2025 was 12.5 million, a decrease of 693,000 or 5.3 , as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was due primarily to higher PCL expense, as well as higher noninterest expense. Included in noninterest expense was a one-time expense to complete a performance improvement project to enhance operations and revenues of the Bank. This was partially offset by increases in noninterest income and net interest income. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, basic and fully-diluted net income per share available to common shareholders was 1.10 under both measures, as compared to 1.16 under both measures for the same period of the prior fiscal year, which represented decreases of 0.06, or 5.2 under both measures. Our annualized return on average assets (ROA) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 1.07 , as compared to 1.20 for the same period of the prior fiscal year. Our return on average common stockholders equity (ROE) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 10.0 , as compared to 11.7 for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The one-time cost for the performance improvement review totaled 840,000, reduced after-tax net income by 652,000, or 0.06 per fully diluted common share, and reduced after-tax ROA by six basis points and ROE by 52 basis points. Net Interest Income. Net interest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 36.7 million, an increase of 1.3 million, or 3.6 , as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was attributable to a 5.9 increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets in the current three-month period, as compared to the same period a year ago, partially offset by a seven basis point decrease in net interest margin, from 3.44 to 3.37 , as

Table of Contents 
 the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 70 basis points, outpacing the 54-basis point increase in the yield earned on interest earning assets. Loan discount accretion and deposit premium amortization related to the November 2018 acquisition of First Commercial Bank, the May 2020 acquisition of Central Federal Savings Loan Association, the February 2022 merger of FortuneBank, and the January 2023 acquisition of Citizens Bank Trust resulted in 975,000 in net interest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.7 million in net interest income for the same period a year ago. Combined, this component of net interest income contributed nine basis points to net interest margin in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a 16 basis point contribution for the same period of the prior fiscal year, and as compared to a ten basis point contribution in the linked quarter ended June 30, 2024, when net interest margin was 3.25 . Provision for Credit Losses. The PCL was 2.2 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a PCL of 900,000 in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The current period PCL was the result of a 2.0 million provision attributable to the ACL for loan balances outstanding and a 138,000 provision attributable to the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures. (See Critical Accounting Policies , Allowance for Credit Loss Activity and Nonperforming Assets ). Noninterest Income. Noninterest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 7.2 million, an increase of 1.3 million, or 22.6 , as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in other loan fees, deposit account charges and related fees, bank card interchange income, and net realized gains on sale of loans. Net realized gains on sale of loans increased due to sales of Small Business Administration loans. These increases were partially offset by lower loan late charges, wealth management fees, and other noninterest income. Other noninterest income decreased primarily due to modest losses on the disposal of fixed assets, which were comprised of various equipment. Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 25.8 million, an increase of 2.1 million, or 9.0 , as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. In the current quarter, this increase was attributable primarily to increases in compensation and benefits, legal and professional fees, occupancy and equipment, and advertising expenses. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was primarily due to a trend increase in employee headcount, as well as annual merit increases. Legal and professional expenses increased primarily due to a one-time expense for a performance improvement project that started during the first fiscal quarter of 2025, as discussed above. This expense was fully realized in the September quarter, with only modest reimbursables remaining to be recognized in later quarters. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased primarily due to depreciation on recent capitalized expenditures, including buildings, equipment, and signage. Advertising activity in the current quarter increased marketing expenses compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Income Taxes. The income tax provision for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 3.4 million, a decrease of 3.2 , as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the decrease in net income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 21.3 as compared to 21.0 in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Allowance for Credit Loss Activity The Company regularly reviews its ACL and makes adjustments to its balance based on management s estimate of (1) the total expected losses included in the Company s financial assets held at amortized cost, which is limited to the Company s loan portfolio, and (2) any credit deterioration in the Company s available-for-sale securities as of the balance sheet date. The Company does not hold any securities classified as held-to-maturity. Although the Company maintains its ACL at a level that it considers sufficient to provide for losses, there can be no assurance that future losses will not exceed internal estimates. In addition, the amount of the ACL is subject to review by regulatory agencies, which can order the Company to record additional allowances. The required ACL has been estimated based upon the guidelines in ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses.

Table of Contents 
 The estimate involves consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the loan portfolio as segmented by the Company, and is based on an evaluation, at the reporting date, of historical loss experience, coupled with qualitative adjustments to address current economic conditions and credit quality, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Specific qualitative factors considered include, but may not be limited to: Changes in lending policies and/or loan review system National, regional, and local economic trends and/or conditions Changes and/or trends in the nature, volume, or terms of the loan portfolio Experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff Levels and/or trends of delinquent, non-accrual, problem assets, or charge offs and recoveries Concentrations of credit Changes in collateral values Agricultural economic conditions Risks from regulatory, legal, or competitive factors The following table summarizes changes in the ACL over the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

For the three months ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Balance, beginning of period 52,516 47,820 Loans charged off: 1-4 residential real estate (48) (35) Non-owner occupied commercial real estate Owner occupied commercial real estate Multi-family real estate (97) Construction and land development (111) Agriculture real estate Commercial and industrial (39) (4) Agriculture production Consumer (72) (88) All other loans Gross charged off loans (159) (335) Recoveries of loans previously charged off: 1-4 residential real estate 33 Non-owner occupied commercial real estate Owner occupied commercial real estate Multi-family real estate 47 Construction and land development 18 Agriculture real estate Commercial and industrial 5 3 Agriculture production Consumer 7 13 All other loans Gross recoveries of charged off loans 59 67 Net charge offs (100) (268) Provision charged to expense 2,021 1,570 Balance, end of period 54,437 49,122 Our ACL at September 30, 2024, totaled 54.4 million, representing 1.37 of gross loans and 663 of nonperforming loans, as compared to an ACL of 52.5 million, representing 1.36 of gross loans and 786 of nonperforming loans, at June 30, 2024. The Company has estimated its expected credit losses as of September 30, 2024, under ASC 326-20, and management believes the ACL as of that date was adequate based on that estimate. There remains, however, significant uncertainty as the Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy to address inflation risks. The PCL was based on the estimated required ACL, reflecting management s estimate of the current expected credit losses in the Company s loan portfolio at September 30, 2024. Qualitative adjustments in the Company s ACL model were slightly decreased compared to June 30, 2024. In addition, Company increased the allowance attributable to classified hotel loans that have been slow to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The PCL was also increased due to loan growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and a slight increase in modeled expected losses due to a modest increase in the unemployment rate

 expectations. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, the Company recorded net charge offs of 0.01 (annualized) during the current period, as compared to 0.03 (annualized) for the same period of the prior fiscal year. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had accrued within other liabilities an allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures of 3.4 million, as compared to 3.3 million at June 30, 2024. The increase reflects the component of the PCL attributable to off-balance sheet credit exposures noted above. This amount is maintained as a separate liability account to cover estimated credit losses associated with off-balance sheet credit instruments such as off-balance sheet loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and guarantees. The 138,000 increase in the estimated allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures was primarily the result of an expected increase in credit utilization based on historical usage of these off-balance sheet credit exposures. The following table sets forth the sum of the amounts of the ACL attributable to individual loans within each category, or the loan categories in general, and the percentage of the ACL that is attributable to each category, as of the reporting date. The table also reflects the percentage of loans in each category to the total loan portfolio, as of the reporting date.

Loans that are classified with an adverse internal credit rating or identified as modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are most commonly considered for individual evaluation. The ACL for individually evaluated loans may be estimated based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, or based on the present value of expected cash flows. At September 30, 2024, the Company had loans of 40.4 million, or 1.02 of total loans, adversely classified 40.4 million classified substandard none classified doubtful ), as compared to loans of 40.9 million, or 1.06 of total loans, adversely classified 40.9 million classified substandard none classified doubtful at June 30, 2024, and 42.5 million, or 1.15 of total loans, adversely classified 42.5 million classified substandard none classified doubtful at September 30, 2023. Classified loans were generally comprised of loans secured by commercial and residential real estate, and other commercial purpose collateral. All of these loans were classified due to concerns as to the borrowers ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to service the debt. Of our classified loans, the Company had ceased recognition of interest on loans with a carrying value of 8.2 million at September 30, 2024. As reported in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company s total past due loans increased from 9.2 million at June 30, 2024, to 13.4 million at September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily from loans collateralized by 1-4 family real estate and agricultural real estate. Total past due loans were 28.4 million at September 30, 2023. See Note 4 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses Past Due Loans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Nonperforming Assets The ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets and nonperforming loans to net loans receivable is another measure of asset quality. Nonperforming assets of the Company include nonaccruing loans, accruing loans delinquent/past maturity 90 days or more, and assets which have been acquired as a result of foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The table below summarizes changes in the Company s level of nonperforming assets over selected time periods: 

September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Nonaccruing loans: 1-4 residential real estate 2,502 1,391 1,040 Non-owner occupied commercial real estate 44 Owner occupied commercial real estate 1,326 1,102 524 Multi-family real estate Construction and land development 250 108 418 Agriculture real estate 1,940 1,896 2,743 Commercial and industrial 1,673 1,703 710 Agriculture production 412 186 Consumer 103 19 73 All other loans 461 Total 8,206 6,680 5,738 Loans 90 days past due accruing interest: 1-4 residential real estate Non-owner occupied commercial real estate Owner occupied commercial real estate Multi-family real estate Construction and land development Agriculture real estate Commercial and industrial Agriculture production Consumer All other loans Total Total nonperforming loans 8,206 6,680 5,738 Nonperforming investments Foreclosed assets held for sale: Real estate owned 3,842 3,865 4,981 Other nonperforming assets 21 23 83 Total nonperforming assets 12,069 10,568 10,802 The Company adopted ASU No. 2022-02 in fiscal 2024, which eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. At September 30, 2024, modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty totaled 25.2 million, of which 891,000 was considered nonperforming and included in the nonaccrual loan total above. The remaining 24.3 million in modified loans have complied with the modified terms for a reasonable period of time and are therefore considered by the Company to be accrual status loans. On the basis of guidance under ASU No. 2022-02, in general, these loans were subject to classification as modifications due to payment delays and term extensions given to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty at September 30, 2024. At June 30, 2024, these modifications totaled 25.5 million, of which 895,000 was considered nonperforming and included in the nonaccrual loan total above. The remaining 24.6 million in modifications at June 30, 2024, had complied with the modified terms for a reasonable period of time and were therefore considered by the Company to be accrual status loans.

 At September 30, 2024, nonperforming assets totaled 12.1 million, as compared to 10.6 million at June 30, 2024, and 10.8 million at September 30, 2023. The change in nonperforming assets was attributable to the increase of 1.5 million in nonperforming loans, of which the largest individual loan was collateralized by a single-family residential property. Liquidity Resources The term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations, loans purchases, deposit withdrawals and operating expenses. Our primary sources of funds include deposit growth, FHLB advances, brokered deposits, amortization and prepayment of loan principal and interest, investment maturities and sales, and funds provided by our operations. While the scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable, deposit flows, FHLB advance redemptions, and loan and security prepayment rates are significantly influenced by factors outside of the Bank s control, including interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace. The Bank relies on FHLB advances and brokered deposits as additional sources for funding cash or liquidity needs. The Company uses its liquid resources principally to satisfy its ongoing cash requirements, which include funding loan commitments, funding maturing certificates of deposit and deposit withdrawals, maintaining liquidity, funding maturing or called FHLB advances, purchasing investments, and meeting operating expenses. At September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding commitments and approvals to extend credit of approximately 902.0 million (including 605.5 million in unused lines of credit) in mortgage and non-mortgage loans. These commitments and approvals are expected to be funded through existing cash balances, cash flow from normal operations and, if needed, advances from the FHLB or the Federal Reserve s discount window. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had pledged 1.5 billion of its single-family residential, home equity, and commercial real estate loan portfolios to the FHLB for available credit of approximately 870.3 million, of which 107.1 million was advanced, while 479,000 was encumbered by residential real estate loans sold onto the secondary market through the FHLB, and none was utilized as collateral for the issuance of letters of credit to secure public unit deposits. The Bank has the ability to pledge other assets, including, for example, additional unpledged real estate loans held by the Bank or the Bank s REIT, and the unpledged securities in the Bank s portfolio, which could provide additional collateral for additional borrowings. In total, FHLB borrowings are generally limited to 45 of bank assets, or approximately 2.0 billion, subject to available collateral. Also, at September 30, 2024, the Bank had pledged a total of 415.0 million in loans secured by farmland and agricultural production loans to the Federal Reserve, providing access to 357.9 million in primary credit borrowings from the Federal Reserve s discount window, none of which was advanced at September 30, 2024. In addition, the Bank has other assets available to pledge to the Federal Reserve, such as commercial loans, which could provide additional collateral for additional borrowings. Management believes its liquid resources will be sufficient to meet the Company s liquidity needs. Regulatory Capital The Company and Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company and the Bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under U.S. GAAP, regulatory reporting requirements and regulatory capital standards. The Company and Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Furthermore, the Company and Bank s regulators could require adjustments to regulatory capital not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Quantitative measures established by regulatory capital standards to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total capital, Tier 1 capital (as defined), and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital (as

 defined) to average total assets (as defined). Additionally, to make distributions or discretionary bonus payments, the Company and Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 of risk-weighted assets. Management believes, as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. In August 2020, the Federal banking agencies adopted a final rule updating a December 2018 rule regarding the impact on regulatory capital of adoption of the CECL standard. The rule allows institutions that adopted the CECL standard in 2020 a five-year transition period to recognize the estimated impact of adoption on regulatory capital. The Company and the Bank elected to exercise the option to recognize the impact of adoption over the five-year period. As of September 30, 2024, the most recent notification from the Federal banking agencies categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, common equity Tier 1 risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s category. The tables below summarize the Company s and Bank s actual and required regulatory capital at the dates indicated:

 PART I: Item 3 : Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk SOUTHERN MISSOURI BANCORP, INC. Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk The goal of the Company s asset/liability management strategy is to manage the interest rate sensitivity of both interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities in order to maximize net interest income without exposing the Company to an excessive level of interest rate risk. The Company employs various strategies intended to manage the potential effect that changing interest rates may have on future operating results. The primary asset/liability management strategy has been to focus on matching the anticipated repricing intervals of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. At times, however, depending on the level of general interest rates, the relationship between long- and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, the Company may increase its interest rate risk position in order to maintain its net interest margin. In an effort to manage the interest rate risk resulting from fixed rate lending, the Company has at times utilized longer term (up to 10 year maturities), fixed-rate FHLB advances, which may be subject to early redemption, to offset interest rate risk. Other elements of the Company s current asset/liability strategy include: (i) increasing originations of commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, agricultural real estate loans, and agricultural operating lines, which typically provide higher yields and shorter repricing periods, but inherently increase credit risk, (ii) limiting the price volatility of the investment portfolio by maintaining a relatively short weighted average maturity, (iii) actively soliciting less rate-sensitive nonmaturity deposits, and (iv) offering competitively priced money market accounts and CDs with maturities of up to five years. The degree to which each segment of the strategy is achieved will affect profitability and exposure to interest rate risk. The Company continues to originate long-term, fixed-rate residential loans. During the first three months of fiscal year 2025, fixed rate 1-to 4-family residential loan production totaled 31.1 million (of which 4.6 million was originated for sale into the secondary market), as compared to 36.4 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year (of which 5.6 million was originated for sale into the secondary market). At September 30, 2024, the fixed rate 1-4 family residential loan portfolio was 624.1 million with a weighted average maturity of 172 months, as compared to 599.6 million at September 30, 2023, with a weighted average maturity of 186 months. The Company originated 11.1 million in adjustable-rate 1- to 4-family residential loans during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 20.4 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year. The Company originated 95.2 million in fixed rate commercial and commercial real estate loans during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 60.8 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year. The Company also originated 32.2 million in adjustable rate commercial and commercial real estate loans during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 21.3 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year. At September 30, 2024, adjustable-rate home equity lines of credit increased to 77.4 million, as compared to 67.0 million at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, all fixed rate loans with remaining maturities in excess of 10 years totaled 365.8 million, or 9.4 of net loans receivable, as compared to 370.4 million, or 10.1 of net loans receivable at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company s investment portfolio had a weighted-average life of 4.8 years, compared to 5.2 years at September 30, 2023, while the effective duration of the portfolio declined to 2.4 per 100 basis points movement in market rates at September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.7 at September 30, 2023. Management continues to focus on customer retention, customer satisfaction, and offering new products to customers in order to increase the Company s amount of less rate-sensitive deposit accounts.

 Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis The following table sets forth as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, management s estimates of the projected changes in net portfolio value (NPV) in the event of 100, 200, and 300 basis point (bp) instantaneous, permanent, and parallel increases, and 100, 200, and 300 basis point instantaneous, permanent, and parallel decreases in market interest rates. Dollar amounts are expressed in thousands.

Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions the Bank may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Management cannot predict future interest rates or their effect on the Bank s NPV in the future. Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of NPV. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have an initial fixed rate period typically from one to seven years and over the remaining life of the asset changes in the interest rate are restricted. In addition, the proportion of adjustable-rate loans in the Bank s portfolios could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity if market interest rates remain steady in the future. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in the table. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable-rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. The Company s growth strategy has included origination of fixed-rate loans, as discussed under Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, above. Our fixed rate loan portfolio and the behavior of fixed-rate borrowers in a higher interest rate environment, especially over the course of fiscal 2023 and 2024, pressured our NPV. Since June 30, 2024, market interest rates have decreased, positively impacting our underlying NPV, attributable to the impact of lower rates on our longer-term fixed rate loans as of September 30, 2024. The Company s sensitivity has also decreased in this period due to an increase in cash balances, a slight decrease in the percentage of total fixed rate loans, and a small reduction in the weighted-average life of the fixed rate loan portfolio. In addition to these on-balance sheet 

 -57-

 changes, the Company also increased the notional amount of its pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swaps, designed to hedge the residential loan portfolio against the risk of rising interest rates, to 50 million at September 30, 2024, as compared to 40 million in similar interest rate swaps outstanding at June 30, 2024. The Company continues to manage its balance sheet to maximize earnings through interest rate cycles, while maintaining safe and sound risk management practices. Over time, the Company has worked to limit its exposure to rising rates by increasing the share of funding on its balance sheet obtained through lower cost non-maturity transaction accounts and retail time deposits, and by limiting short-term FHLB borrowings. The Bank s board of directors is responsible for reviewing the Bank s asset and liability policies. The Bank s Asset/Liability Committee meets monthly to review interest rate risk and trends, as well as liquidity and capital ratios and requirements. The Bank s management is responsible for administering the policies and determinations of the board of directors with respect to the Bank s asset and liability goals and strategies.

 PART I: Item 4 : Controls and Procedures SOUTHERN MISSOURI BANCORP, INC. An evaluation of Southern Missouri s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Act )) as of September 30, 2024 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Administrative Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and several other members of our senior management. Our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Administrative Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to management (including our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Administrative Officer and our Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The Company does not expect that its disclosures and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
