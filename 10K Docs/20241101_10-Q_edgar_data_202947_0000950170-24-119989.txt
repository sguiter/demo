 long-term land leases, of which have completed construction of improvements thereon. The Company s leases generally have a term of years or more, are triple net and provide for periodic rent adjustments of various types depending on the particular lease, and otherwise contain terms and conditions normal for such instruments. Under the land leases, the tenants may negotiate tax stabilization treaties or other arrangements, appeal any changes in real property assessments, and must pay real property taxes assessed on land and improvements. Accordingly, real property taxes payable by the tenants are excluded from both leasing revenues and leasing expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income and shareholders equity. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, real property taxes attributable to the Company s land under lease totaled and , respectively. On January 25, 2024, the Company entered into a long-term ground lease of Parcel 20. Under the terms of the lease, tenant's possession will not occur until such time as the tenant has received all necessary approvals for construction of not less than square feet of mixed use improvements. Prior to transfer of possession, rent is being paid by the tenant and the Company receives all rents from existing tenants and parking lease revenue and remains responsible for all expenses, including real estate taxes, related to Parcel 20. Following tenant's possession, tenant is obligated to pay ground rent for the parcel and to purchase the historic building presently located on the premises for an additional amount payable monthly over twenty years.

of the long-term land leases, the Company receives contingent rentals (based on a fixed percentage of gross revenue received by the tenants) which totaled and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and were and for the same periods in 2023. Tri-State Displays Inc. leases outdoor advertising locations containing billboard faces along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar under a lease which expires in . The Lamar lease provides, among other things, for the following: (1) the base rent will increase annually at the rate of for each leased billboard location on June 1 of each year, and (2) in addition to base rent, for each -month period commencing each June 1 (each 12-month period a Lease Year ), Lamar must pay to the Company within after the close of the Lease Year, of the gross revenues from each standard billboard and of the gross revenues from each electronic billboard for such Lease Year, reduced by the sum of (a) commissions paid to unrelated third parties and (b) base rent paid to the Company for each leased billboard location. Leasing revenue includes and for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to this agreement. Parking lease: The Company leases the undeveloped parcels of land in the Capital Center area (other than Parcel 6C) and Parcel 20 for public parking purposes to Metropark under a lease (the Parking Lease ). The Parking Lease is cancellable as to all or any portion of the leased premises at any time on written notice in order for the Company or any new tenant of the Company to develop all or any portion of the leased premises. The Parking Lease provides for contingent rentals (based on a fixed percentage of gross revenue in excess of the base rent). There was contingent rent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on Metropark s parking operations as the move by many companies to a hybrid workplace model (one that mixes in-office and remote work) resulted in lower demand for parking spaces. From June 2020 through December 31, 2023 revenue was recognized on a cash basis with the difference between the regularly scheduled rental payments and amounts paid ("deferred rent") recorded as accounts receivable and was fully reserved. At September 30, 2023 the receivable from Metropark was and was fully reserved. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to its Lease Agreement whereby Metropark agreed to return to a fixed monthly rental payment of per month subject to adjustment in accordance with the Lease Agreement. Additionally, the Company and Metropark settled the Company s claim for deferred rent for all prior periods which amounted to (fully reserved by the Company) for payable by Metropark in twenty equal quarterly installments commencing on April 1, 2024 together with interest on the unpaid balance at the rate of per annum. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Prepaid and other includes and , respectively, related to this settlement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , revenue from Metropark was and , respectively, and and for the same periods in 2023 and is included in revenue on the accompanying consolidated statement of income. Historically, the Company has made financial statement disclosure of the excess of straight-line rentals over contractual payments and its determination of collectability of such excess. To the extent the Company determines that, with respect to any of its leases, the excess of straight-line rentals over contractual payments is not collectible, such excess is not recognized as revenue. Consistent with prior conclusions, the Company has determined that, at this time, the excess of straight-line rentals over contractual payments is not probable of collection. Accordingly, the Company has not included any part of that amount in revenue. As a matter of information only, as of September 30, 2024 the excess of straight-line rentals (calculated by excluding variable payments) over contractual payments was .

Item 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain portions of this report, and particularly the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Sections 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Sections 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which represent the Company s expectations or beliefs concerning future events. The Company cautions that these statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the following: the ability of the Company to generate adequate amounts of cash; the collectability of the excess of straight-line over contractual rents when due over the terms of the long-term leases; tenant default under one or more of the leases; the commencement of additional long-term land leases; changes in economic conditions that may affect either the current or future development on the Company s parcels; cyber penetrations; the long-term impact of the hybrid workplace model on future development, existing tenants and parking operations, and the Company's financial performance; and exposure to remediation and other costs associated with its former operation of the petroleum storage facility. The Company does not undertake the obligation to update forward-looking statements in response to new information, future events or otherwise. 1. Overview: 

 Critical accounting policies: The Company believes that its revenue recognition policy for long-term leases with scheduled rent increases meets the definition of a critical accounting policy which is discussed in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no changes to the application of this accounting policy since December 31, 2023. 2. Liquidity and capital resources: 

 Historically, the Company has had adequate liquidity to fund its operations. Cash and cash commitments: At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 973,000. In addition to these funds, the Company has 1,294,000 invested in U.S. Treasury securities that yield 4.86 and mature in March 2025. The Company and its subsidiary each maintain checking accounts and a money market account in one bank, all of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to a maximum of 250,000. The Company periodically evaluates the financial stability of the financial institutions at which the Company s funds are held. To date, all tenants have paid their monthly rent in accordance with their lease agreements. The Terminal Sale Agreement and related documentation provides that the Company is required to secure an approved remediation plan and to remediate contamination caused by a leak in 1994 from a storage tank at the Terminal. At September 30, 2024, the Company s accrual for the remaining cost of remediation was 365,000 of which 22,000 is expected to be incurred during the balance of 2024. Any subsequent increases or decreases to the expected cost of remediation will be recorded in gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes. The Terminal Sale Agreement also contained a cost sharing provision for a breasting dolphin whereby any construction costs in excess of the contract cost of construction would be borne equally by Sprague and the Company subject to certain limitations, including, in the Company s opinion, a 20 cap on the increase from the initial estimate subject to the sharing arrangement. In November 2019, Sprague asserted that it was owed 427,000 and the Company asserted that its obligation under the Agreement could not exceed 104,000. Mediation efforts were unsuccessful and in July 2021, Sprague commenced an action against the Company in the Rhode Island Superior Court (Superior Court) seeking monetary damages of 427,000, plus interest and attorney s fees. In December 2022, the Superior Court denied Sprague s Motion for Summary Judgment filed in September 2022 and granted in part and denied in part the Company s Cross Motion for Summary Judgment also filed in September 2022. The matter went to trial before a Superior Court judge in May 2024. Post-trial briefs were filed on July 25, 2024. On October 28, 2024, the Superior Court rendered its decision and found that the Company s obligation with respect to the increased cost of constructing the breasting dolphin is 104,000. In accordance with Rhode Island law, the Court also awarded Sprague prejudgment interest of 12 per annum from the date the claim accrued which the Company anticipates that at the time judgment is entered by the Court will total approximately 45,000. The Company and Sprague each have thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the judgment by the Court to file a notice of appeal. The Company is still evaluating whether to appeal. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Liabilities, other includes 149,000 and 104,000, respectively, related to this matter.

Loss on sale of discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated statements of income and shareholders equity includes legal and professional fees related to the Sprague Litigation of 10,000 and 386,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively and 4,000 and 29,000 in each of the same periods for 2023 related to the Sprague litigation. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the loss also includes prejudgment interest of 45,000 related to the Sprague Litigation. The declaration of future dividends will depend on future earnings and financial performance. 3. Results of operations: 

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023: Revenue increased 59,000 from 2023 and consists of increased revenue from Metropark 24,000), scheduled rent increases 31,000) and a net increase in other sources of revenue 4,000), Operating expenses increased 32,000 due principally to professional fees related to the Company's billboard operations.

General and administrative expense increased 43,000 due principally to increased payroll and payroll related costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s effective income tax rate is approximately 27 of income before income taxes.

Item 4.	Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's principal executive officer and the Company's principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. There was no significant change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
