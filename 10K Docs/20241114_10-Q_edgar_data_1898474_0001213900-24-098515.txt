Private Placement 

In March 2023 and April 2023, the Company conducted

agreements with a number of accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company issued unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate
principal amount of , which bear interest at the annual rate of , and accompanying warrants to purchase an aggregate

unsecured promissory notes must be repaid upon the earlier to occur of the consummation of a Liquidity Event or the second anniversary
of the initial closing date of the respective private placement (March 17, 2025 as to principal and May 2, 2025 as to
 principal). If a Liquidity Event occurs before the second anniversary of the initial closing date of the applicable private
placement, the warrants will be automatically exercised as to the unexercised portion of the warrants, the outstanding balance under
the unsecured promissory notes will be deemed repaid in the amount of the exercise price for the automatic exercise of the unexercised
portion of the related warrants, with any remaining balance owed on the promissory notes to be repaid in cash. If a Liquidity Event does
not occur before the second anniversary of the initial closing date of the applicable private placement, then both principal and interest
outstanding under the notes must be repaid in cash. The Company agreed to register the resale all of the shares of common stock that
such warrants may or shall be exercised to purchase with the shares being registered for sale in the registration statement of which
this prospectus forms a part. The Company must generally keep the registration statement effective for a period as shall be required

agent s warrants must be registered for resale with the Company s initial public offering. However, Boustead has informally
deferred these registration rights with respect to the registration statement for the initial public offering. 

Under the subscription agreements with the investors
in the first of these two private placements, the Company was required to use the first of the net proceeds from the private
placement to expand its current operations, including its technology and intellectual property portfolio, and to fund the costs of its
initial public offering. The Company was required to use the next of the net proceeds from the private placement for the
Repurchase. The Repurchase was required to be consummated only to the extent that it did not impair the Company s capital within

Overview 

We are a technology
company developing and operating a platform to give significantly more student-athletes the opportunity to go to college and continue
playing sports. Our platform, Signing Day Sports, is a digital ecosystem to help student-athletes get discovered and recruited by coaches
and recruiters across the country. We fully support football, baseball, softball, and men s and women s soccer, and we plan
to expand the Signing Day Sports platform to include additional sports. Each sport is led by former professional athletes and coaches
who know what it takes to get to the big leagues. 

Signing Day Sports launched in 2019. During the
first nine months of 2024, 6,762 aspiring high school athletes and groups throughout the United States subscribed to the Signing Day
Sports platform. Colleges in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, Division II, and Division III, and the National
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), have utilized our platform for recruitment purposes. 

In short, we offer a comprehensive solution that
services the needs of all participants in the sports recruitment process. Our goal is to change the way sports recruitment is done for
the betterment of everyone.

Our Historical Performance 

The Company s
independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. We have incurred losses for each period from our inception and a significant accumulated deficit. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net loss was approximately 5.413 million and approximately 2.676 million, respectively, and our net
cash used in operating activities was approximately 3.489 million and approximately 1.497 million, respectively. For the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our net loss was approximately 5.478 million and approximately 6.674 million, respectively, and our
cash used in operating activities was approximately 4.848 million and approximately 4.928 million, respectively. As of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 22.372 million and 16.959 million, respectively. As of September
30, 2024, we had total current liabilities of approximately 2.605 million, compared to approximately 1,000 in cash and cash equivalents.
For more information regarding our financial condition, see Our current liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition
or liquidity, and we could have difficulty fulfilling our financial obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on us . 
in Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

In anticipation of a
transaction intended to allow us to continue as a going concern, on September 18, 2024, the Company entered into a Binding Term Sheet
to acquire 99.13 of the issued and outstanding capital stock of DRCR, in exchange for, among other consideration, the issuance of common
stock and preferred stock to the stockholders of DRCR that would constitute approximately 91.76 of the as-converted and fully-diluted
shares of the Company. We believe that DRCR s reported growth, revenue generation, profitability, financial resources, and capital-raising
abilities, following the Company s acquisition of DRCR, if successful, will significantly enhance the Company s revenue generation,
technical capabilities, profitability, and ability to raise capital. The transaction remains subject to execution of definitive stock
purchase agreement(s) and the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions and post-closing conditions. There can be no assurance that
definitive stock purchase agreement(s) will be entered into or that the transaction will be consummated. See Liquidity
and Capital Resources Recent Developments Amendment to Binding Term Sheet and Liquidity and
Capital Resources Contractual Obligations Binding Term Sheet . We are also actively seeking to raise funds,
primarily to pay off existing liabilities, rather than for growth or expansion. If we are successful in these regards, we will seek substantial
additional capital to fund our planned operations and growth until September 30, 2025 and for at least 12 months beyond that period in
order to transition to profitable operations and finance operations primarily from profits. Such acquisition and funding, if obtained,
is expected to mitigate the factors which raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. However,
there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these regards, or that its financial resources will be sufficient to
remain in operation or that necessary financing will be available on satisfactory terms, if at all. The Company may be forced to significantly
reduce its spending, delay or cancel its planned activities, sell off substantial assets, or substantially change its business plans
or corporate or capital structure. There can also be no assurance that the Company will ever succeed in generating sufficient revenues
to continue its operations as a going concern. For further discussion, see We will need to obtain additional funding to continue
operations. If we fail to obtain the necessary financing or fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing
basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations and be forced to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue our operations
or explore other strategies. in Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors and Liquidity and Capital
Resources Going Concern below. 

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting
Company 

We qualify as an emerging growth company 
under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to,
rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: 

have
 an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b)
 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 

present
 three years, and may instead present only two years, of audited financial statements, with
 correspondingly reduced Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
 and Results of Operations disclosure in certain filings with the SEC; 

comply
 with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
 regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing
 additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion
 and analysis); 

comply
 with certain greenhouse gas emissions disclosure and related third-party assurance requirements; 

submit
 certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay 
 and say-on-frequency; and 

disclose
 certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation
 and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median
 employee compensation. 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also
provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an
emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private
companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore
not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

29 

We will remain an emerging growth company for
up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed
 1,235,000,000, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates
exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have
issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. 

To the extent that we continue to qualify as
a smaller reporting company, as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, after we cease to qualify as
an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us
as a smaller reporting company, including as to: (i) the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
(ii) scaled executive compensation disclosures; (iii) presenting two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years; and
(iv) compliance with certain greenhouse gas emissions disclosure and related third-party assurance requirements. 

Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance 

Our operating results are primarily affected
by the following factors: 

our ability to acquire
 new customers and users or retain existing customers and users; 

our ability to offer
 competitive product pricing; 

our ability to broaden
 product offerings; 

our ability to leverage
 technology and use and develop efficient processes; 

our ability to attract
 and retain talented employees; 

industry demand and
 competition; and 

market
 conditions and our market position.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
 of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1,408. As of September 30, 2024,
 we also had total current liabilities of 2,604,701. As of September 30, 2024, we have financed
 our operations primarily from private placements of securities and our initial public offering. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our levels of cash will only be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for our operations and other cash
requirements until September 30, 2025 and for at least 12 months beyond that period, including our costs associated with being a public
reporting company, if we receive additional financing. We may also in the future require additional or alternative cash resources due
to changing business conditions, pursuit of rapid product development, significant expansion or introduction of major marketing campaigns,
or to fund significant business investments or acquisitions. Since our own financial resources may be insufficient to satisfy our capital
requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities in public offerings, private placements or credit facilities.
The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in
increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations.
Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms
favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. Our auditor s
opinion included in our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 contain an explanatory paragraph
regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In recent years, we have suffered recurring losses from
operations, negative working capital and cash outflows from operating activities, and therefore have been dependent upon external sources
for financing our operations. 

In
anticipation of a transaction intended to allow us to continue as a going concern, on September 18, 2024, the Company entered into a
Binding Term Sheet to acquire 99.13 of the issued and outstanding capital stock of DRCR, in exchange for, among other consideration,
the issuance of common stock and preferred stock to the stockholders of DRCR that would constitute approximately 91.76 of the as-converted
and fully-diluted shares of the Company. We believe that DRCR s reported growth, revenue generation, profitability, financial resources,
and capital-raising abilities, following the Company s acquisition of DRCR, if successful, will significantly enhance the Company s
revenue generation, technical capabilities, profitability, and ability to raise capital. The transaction remains subject to execution
of definitive stock purchase agreement(s) and the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions and post-closing conditions. There can
be no assurance that definitive stock purchase agreement(s) will be entered into or that the transaction will be consummated. See Liquidity
and Capital Resources Recent Developments . We are also actively seeking to raise funds, primarily to pay off existing
liabilities, rather than for growth or expansion. If we are successful in these regards, we will seek substantial additional capital
to fund our planned operations and growth until September 30, 2025 and for at least 12 months beyond that period in order to transition
to profitable operations and finance operations primarily from profits. Such acquisition and funding, if obtained, is expected to mitigate
the factors which raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. However, there
can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these regards, or that its financial resources will be sufficient to remain
in operation or that necessary financing will be available on satisfactory terms, if at all. The Company may be forced to significantly
reduce its spending, delay or cancel its planned activities, sell off substantial assets, or substantially change its business plans
or corporate or capital structure. There can also be no assurance that the Company will ever succeed in generating sufficient revenues
to continue its operations as a going concern. For further discussion, see We will need to obtain additional funding to continue
operations. If we fail to obtain the necessary financing or fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing
basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations and be forced to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue our operations
or explore other strategies. in Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors . 

The
financial statements that accompany this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

approximately 0.249 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while net cash provided by financing activities was approximately

37 

The
DRCR Term Sheet also provides that the Company and DRCR will use commercially reasonable efforts to secure funding of at least 2.0 million
as soon as possible, the net proceeds of which will be equally split between the Company and DRCR and are to be used for operations and,
in the case of the Company, to pay down its indebtedness and other liabilities. Such division of the net proceeds of any such funding

three of the Company s post-Closing board of directors will be nominees of DRCR s board of directors, one nominee will be

Although
the DRCR Term Sheet Closing will not be subject to stockholder approval, the conversion of the preferred stock issuable to the Sellers
and other sellers at the DRCR Term Sheet Closing and the related change in control that will occur upon such conversion will be subject
to stockholder approval. Stockholder approval will also be required for the election of the parties nominees to the Company s
board of directors. Prior to the conversion of the preferred stock or appointment of each party s nominees to the Company s
board of directors, the Company will seek and must obtain the approval of a new listing application from the NYSE American. 

The
DRCR Term Sheet provides that the DRCR Term Sheet Closing will occur as soon as reasonably practicable and that the parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts to effect the Closing on or before October 31, 2024. 

The
DRCR Term Sheet also provides that the Company, DRCR, and the Sellers will be subject to a non-solicitation period and a no-shop provision
for 30 days following the date of the DRCR Term Sheet. The DRCR Term Sheet further provides for a 500,000 break-up fee upon termination
of the DRCR Term Sheet due to an undisputable uncured material breach by the Company, on the one hand, or DRCR or either of the Sellers,
on the other hand, upon demand by the other. 

All
of the foregoing terms are subject to change upon the negotiation and execution of definitive stock purchase agreement(s). The DRCR Term
Sheet Closing will be subject to the terms and conditions of the definitive stock purchase agreement(s), including completion of due
diligence and satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions. There can be no assurance that definitive stock purchase agreement(s) will
be entered into or that the proposed transactions will be consummated. 

The

by reference to the full text of such exhibit.

Termination
Agreement with Boustead Securities, LLC 

On
September 18, 2024, the Company entered into a Termination Agreement, dated as of September 18, 2024 (the Boustead Termination
Agreement ), with Boustead. The parties entered into the Boustead Termination Agreement in order to terminate the engagement letter,
dated as of August 9, 2021, as amended by letter agreements entered into by Boustead and the Company dated as of November 4, 2023, November
8, 2023, and November 13, 2023 (as amended, the Boustead Engagement Letter ), pursuant to which Boustead had certain rights
to act as a financial advisor to the Company. The Boustead Termination Agreement also provides for the termination of the right of first
refusal (the Boustead Right of First Refusal provided under the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of November 13, 2023,
between the Company and Boustead, as representative of the underwriters in connection with the Company s firm commitment underwritten
initial public offering (the Underwriting Agreement ), in exchange for the issuance of the Termination Shares (as defined
below). 

38 

The
Boustead Termination Agreement provides that the Company will issue to Boustead 3,000,000 shares (the Initial Termination Shares of the Company s common stock by the later of the date that is (i) five business days after the date of the Boustead Termination
Agreement and (ii) the date that the NYSE American authorizes the issuance of the Initial Termination Shares (the Termination
Date ). On the Termination Date, the Boustead Engagement Letter and the Boustead Right of First Refusal and rights and obligations
pursuant to the Boustead Engagement Letter and the Boustead Right of First Refusal will be terminated except with respect to certain
customary surviving provisions. 

The
Boustead Termination Agreement provides that upon issuance of common stock or other securities that are exercisable or exchangeable for,
or convertible into, common stock of the Company to any third party (other than Boustead or any affiliate of Boustead), the Company will
issue to Boustead a number of shares of common stock equal to 10.35 of the shares of common stock (or other securities) so issued by
the Company in any such transaction other than a Change in Control (as defined in the Boustead Termination Agreement) (the Additional
Termination Shares, and, together with the Initial Termination Shares, the Termination Shares ), by the later of
(i) five business days after the date of such issuance and (ii) the date that the NYSE American authorizes the issuance of the Additional
Termination Shares. The Company s obligation to issue Additional Termination Shares will cease immediately prior to the effective
date of a Change in Control and, for the avoidance of doubt, Boustead will not be entitled to any percentage of the securities issued
by the Company in connection with the Change in Control. 

The
Termination Shares have piggyback registration rights. The Boustead Termination Agreement provides that Boustead will not sell more than
10 of the total trading volume on any trading day, provided that the Termination Shares are registered for resale under an effective
registration statement. Boustead will also agree to any leak-out provisions requested by the Company, which will be consistent with any
leak-out agreement signed by other parties in connection with a Change in Control. 

In
addition, the Boustead Termination Agreement requires that if the Company raises at least 1 million in gross proceeds from a financing,
the Company will pay Boustead 100,000 as partial consideration under the Boustead Termination Agreement and 68,467.43 to pay an existing
account payable owed by the Company to Boustead. 

The

Contractual
Obligations to Boustead Securities, LLC 

Prior
to its termination pursuant to the Boustead Termination Agreement, under the Boustead Engagement Letter, we were required to compensate
Boustead with a cash fee equal to 7 and non-accountable expense allowance equal to 1 of the gross proceeds received by the Company
from the sale of securities in an investment transaction, or up to 10 of the gross proceeds from certain other merger, acquisition,
or joint venture, strategic alliance, license, research and development, or other similar transactions, with a party, including any investor
in a private placement in which Boustead served as placement agent, or in our initial public offering in November 2023, or who became
aware of the Company or who became known to the Company prior to the termination or expiration of the Boustead Engagement Letter, for
such transactions that occur during the 12-month period following the termination or expiration of the Boustead Engagement Letter (the
 Tail Rights ). The Boustead Engagement Letter would have expired upon the later to occur of November 16, 2024 (12 months
from the completion date of the initial public offering), or mutual written agreement of the Company and Boustead. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event the Boustead Engagement Letter had been terminated for Cause, which shall mean a material breach
by Boustead of the Boustead Engagement Letter, and which such material breach is not cured, no Tail Rights would have been due. 

Prior
to the termination of the Boustead Engagement Letter and the Boustead Right of First Refusal pursuant to the Boustead Termination Agreement,
the Boustead Engagement Letter and the Underwriting Agreement provided Boustead the Boustead Right of First Refusal, which was a right
of first refusal of Boustead for two years following the consummation of the Company s initial public offering on November 16,
2023, or 18 months following the termination or expiration of the engagement with Boustead to act as financial advisor or to act as joint
financial advisor on or at least equal economic terms on any public or private financing (debt or equity), merger, business combination,
recapitalization or sale of some or all of our equity or our assets. In the event that we had engaged Boustead to provide such
services, Boustead would be required to be compensated consistent with the Boustead Engagement Letter, unless we mutually agreed otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Boustead Engagement Letter was terminated for Cause, which shall mean a
material breach by Boustead of the engagement agreement, and which such material breach is not cured, the Boustead Right of First Refusal
would have terminated, and the Company would have been entitled to pursue any future transaction without adhering to the terms of the
Boustead Right of First Refusal. The exercise of such right of termination for cause would have eliminated the Company s obligations
with respect to the provisions of the Boustead Engagement Letter relating to the Boustead Right of First Refusal. 

Under
the Boustead Engagement Letter, in connection with a transaction as to which Boustead had duly exercised the Boustead Right of First
Refusal or was entitled to the Tail Rights, Boustead was required to receive compensation as follows: 

other
 than normal course of business activities, as to any sale, merger, acquisition, joint venture,
 strategic alliance, license, research and development, or other similar agreements, a percentage
 fee of the Aggregate Consideration (defined to include amounts paid or received, indebtedness
 assumed or remaining outstanding, fair market value of excluded assets, fair market value
 of retained or non-acquired ownership interests, and contingent payments in connection with
 the transaction) calculated as follows: 

o 10.0 
 for Aggregate Consideration of less than 10,000,000; plus 

o 8.0 
 for Aggregate Consideration between 10,000,000 and 25,000,000; plus 

o 6.0 
 for Aggregate Consideration between 25,000,001 and 50,000,000; plus

o 2.0 
 for Aggregate Consideration between 75,000,001 and 100,000,000; plus 

o 1.0 
 for Aggregate Consideration above 100,000,000; 

for
 any investment transaction including any common stock, preferred stock, convertible stock,
 limited liability company or limited partnership memberships, debt, convertible debentures,
 convertible debt, debt with warrants, or any other securities convertible into common stock,
 any form of debt instrument involving any form of equity participation, and including the
 conversion or exercise of any securities sold in any transaction, upon each investment transaction
 closing, a success fee, payable in (i) cash, equal to 7 of the gross amount to be disbursed
 to the Company from each such investment transaction closing, plus (ii) a non-accountable
 expense allowance equal to 1 of the gross amount to be disbursed to the Company from each
 such investment transaction closing, plus (iii) warrants equal to 7 of the gross amount
 to be disbursed to the Company from each such investment transaction closing, including shares
 issuable upon conversion or exercise of the securities sold in any transaction, and in the
 event that warrants or other rights were issued in the investment transaction, 7 of the
 shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants or other rights, and in the event of a debt
 or convertible debt financing, warrants to purchase an amount of Company stock equal to 7 
 of the gross amount or facility received by the Company in a debt financing divided by the
 warrant exercise share. The warrant exercise price would have been the lower of: (i) the
 price per share paid by investors in each respective financing; (ii) in the event that convertible
 securities were sold in the financing, the conversion price of such securities; or (iii)

May
2024 FF Purchase Agreement

rights and rights of first refusal on any offers of the Company s securities other than offerings previously disclosed in the Company s
reports filed with the SEC or any Excluded Issuance (as defined in the May 2024 FF Note and the June 2024 FF Note (as defined in June
2024 Private Placement of Convertible Senior Secured Promissory Note and Warrants )), and most favored nation rights on any

of common stock issuable under the May 2024 FF Note and the May 2024 FF Warrants was limited to the FF Exchange Limitation (as defined
below) until we had obtained stockholder approval (the FF Stockholder Approval to issue shares in excess of 19.99 of
the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company as of the date of the May 2024 FF Purchase Agreement, or 3,074,792 shares of common
stock, which number of shares shall be reduced, on a share-for-share basis, by the number of shares of common stock issued or issuable
pursuant to any transaction or series of transactions that may be aggregated with the transactions contemplated by the May 2024 FF Purchase
Agreement under applicable rules of the NYSE American FF Exchange Limitation ). The Company was required to hold a meeting
of stockholders on or before the date that was six months after the date of the May 2024 FF Purchase Agreement, for the purpose of obtaining
the FF Stockholder Approval, with the recommendation of the Company s board of directors that such proposal be approved; the Company
was required to solicit proxies from the Company s stockholders in connection with the proposal in the same manner as all other
management proposals in such proxy statement; and all management-appointed proxyholders must vote their proxies in favor of such proposal.
In addition, all members of the Company s board of directors and all of the Company s executive officers were required to
vote in favor of such proposal, for purposes of obtaining the FF Stockholder Approval, with respect to all of the Company s securities
then held by such persons, and the Company was generally required to use the Company s commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the FF Stockholder Approval. If the Company had not obtained the FF Stockholder Approval at the first meeting at which the proposal was
voted upon, the Company was required to call a stockholder meeting as often as possible thereafter to seek the FF Stockholder Approval
until the FF Stockholder Approval was obtained. 

48 

On

NYSE American LLC Company Guide (the NYSE American Company Guide ). As a result, the FF Stockholder Approval was obtained. 

May
2024 FF Registration Rights Agreement 

As
required by the May 2024 FF Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of May 16, 2024, between
the Company and FirstFire (the May 2024 FF Registration Rights Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to register
the resale of the May 2024 FF Commitment Shares and the shares of common stock underlying the May 2024 FF Note and the May 2024 FF Warrants
under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement. The Company agreed to file the registration statement with the SEC within
90 calendar days from the date of the May 2024 FF Purchase Agreement and have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC
within 120 days from the date of the May 2024 FF Purchase Agreement. The Company also granted FirstFire certain piggyback registration
rights pursuant to the May 2024 FF Purchase Agreement. A registration statement was filed with the SEC on July 5, 2024 in order to comply
with these requirements. Pursuant to the May 2024 FF Registration Rights Agreement, if the total number of shares issuable upon conversion
of the May 2024 FF Notes or upon exercise of the May 2024 FF Warrants becomes greater than the number that may be offered for resale
by means of the prospectus that forms a part of such registration statement, then the Company will be required to register the additional
shares of common stock for resale by means of one or more separate prospectuses. 

May
2024 FF Note 

The
principal amount of the May 2024 FF Note was based on an original issue discount of 10 and interest at the rate of 10 per annum on
a 365-day basis. The interest was guaranteed, which required that the first 12 months of interest (equal to 41,250) be paid. The May
2024 FF Note was to mature on the earlier of the 12-month anniversary date of the issuance date, or May 16, 2025, and the date of the
consummation of a sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the consolidation, merger
or other business combination of the Company with or into any other entity when the Company is not the survivor. 

Under
the May 2024 FF Note, the Company was required to make eight monthly amortization payments of 56,715 each, commencing September 16,
2024, and pay the entire remaining outstanding balance on May 16, 2025. The Company was permitted to prepay the May 2024 FF Note any
time prior to an FF Notes Event of Default on 15 trading days prior written notice for an amount equal to 110 of the principal
amount then outstanding and 110 of the accrued and unpaid interest outstanding. 

Under
the May 2024 FF Note, the holder of the May 2024 FF Note was permitted, at any time and from time to time, subject to a limitation on
beneficial ownership to 4.99 of the common stock that would be outstanding immediately after conversion or exercise (the FF Beneficial
Ownership Limitation and the FF Exchange Limitation (before the FF Stockholder Approval was obtained), to convert the outstanding
principal amount and accrued interest under the May 2024 FF Note into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of 0.30
per share, subject to adjustment, including adjustments under full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions for any issuances of securities at
a lower price per share or per underlying share of common stock to match the price of such lower-priced securities, other than for an
Excluded Issuance (the FF Notes Fixed Conversion Price ). If the Company failed to make an amortization payment when due
under the May 2024 FF Note, the balance remaining under the May 2024 FF Note would have become convertible, and the conversion price
would have become the lower of the then-applicable FF Notes Fixed Conversion Price and 80 of the lowest closing price of the common
stock during the ten trading days prior to the date of a conversion of the May 2024 FF Note. If an FF Notes Event of Default had occurred,
then the balance remaining under the May 2024 FF Note would have become convertible at the lower of the FF Notes Fixed Conversion Price,
the closing price of the common stock on the date of the FF Notes Event of Default (or the next trading day if such date is not on a
trading day), and 0.195 per share. 

49 

An
FF Notes Event of Default would have occurred upon the occurrence of any of the following: The failure to pay obligations when due; failure
to issue shares upon conversions as required; a material breach of representations and warranties or covenants; the entry of material
judgments against certain of the Company s subsidiaries; the initiation of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings of certain of our
subsidiaries; defaults on other indebtedness; failure to remain subject to and compliant with the Exchange Act; failure to maintain intellectual
property and other necessary assets; the restatement of any financial statements; disclosure or attempted disclosure of material non-public
information to the May 2024 FF Note holder; unavailability of Rule 144 under the Securities Act Rule 144 for resales
of the Company s securities on or after six months from the issuance date of the May 2024 FF Note; and the delisting or suspension
of listing of the Company s common stock by the NYSE American. The occurrence of an FF Notes Event of Default would have resulted
in a number of additional obligations to the May 2024 FF Note holder, including acceleration and multiplication by 125 of the May 2024
FF Note balance; default interest at the rate of the lesser of (i) 15 per annum and (ii) the maximum amount permitted by law from the
due date thereof until the same is paid; and the increase of the principal balance of the May 2024 FF Note by 3,000 each calendar month
until the May 2024 FF Note is repaid in its entirety. 

If,
at any time prior to the full repayment or full conversion of all amounts owed under the May 2024 FF Note, the Company had received cash
proceeds from any source or series of related or unrelated sources on or after the date of the May 2024 FF Note, including but not limited
to, payments from customers, the issuance of equity or debt, the incurrence of Indebtedness (as defined in the May 2024 FF Note and the
June 2024 FF Note), a merchant cash advance, sale of receivables or similar transaction, the exercise of outstanding warrants of the
Company, the issuance of securities pursuant to an Equity Line of Credit or the Company s offering of securities under Regulation
A under the Securities Act, or the Company s sale of assets (including but not limited to real property), the Company was required,
within one business day of the Company s receipt of such proceeds, to inform the holder of the May 2024 FF Note of or publicly
disclose such receipt, following which the holder of the May 2024 FF Note had the right in its sole discretion to require the Company
to immediately apply up to 100 of such proceeds to repay all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount and interest (including
any default interest) then due under the May 2024 FF Note. The 110 prepayment premium would have applied to any repayment of the May
2024 FF Note pursuant to this requirement prior to the occurrence of an FF Notes Event of Default. 

The
May 2024 FF Note was a senior secured obligation of the Company, with priority over all existing and future indebtedness of the Company,
except that the May 2024 FF Note was junior in priority to the Second CBAZ Promissory Note and, in accordance with the Amendment to May
2024 FF Transaction Documents, pari passu in priority to the June 2024 FF Note. The May 2024 FF Note prohibited the Company from incurring
any Indebtedness that was senior to or pari passu with the obligations under the May 2024 FF Note. During the period that any obligation
under the May 2024 FF Note remained outstanding, the Company was prohibited, without the May 2024 FF Note holder s prior written
consent, from declaring or paying any dividends or other distributions on shares of capital stock except in the form of shares of common
stock or distributions pursuant to a stockholders rights plan approved by a majority of the Company s disinterested directors.
The Company also was prohibited from repurchasing any capital stock or repaying any indebtedness other than the May 2024 FF Note and
the Second CBAZ Promissory Note while the Company had any obligation under the May 2024 FF Note without FirstFire s written consent.
The Company was also prohibited from (a) changing the nature of its business; (b) selling, divesting, changing the structure of any material
assets other than in the ordinary course of business; (c) entering into a Variable Rate Transaction; or (d) entering into any merchant
cash advance transaction, sale of receivables transaction, or any other similar transaction, without the consent of FirstFire, which
could not be unreasonably withheld. The May 2024 FF Note also contained a most favored nations provision with respect to the issuance
of any debt securities of the Company. 

On
August 23, 2024, FirstFire converted 41,250 of the outstanding balance under the May 2024 FF Note into 137,500 shares of common stock
at the FF Notes Fixed Conversion Price 0.30 per share). On September 16, 2024, the Company made the first amortization payment required
under the May 2024 FF Note of 56,715. On September 19, 2024, FirstFire effected two conversions of the May 2024 FF Note, which in aggregate
converted the remaining balance of 355,785 under the May 2024 FF Note into 1,185,950 shares of common stock at the FF Notes Fixed Conversion
Price.

May
2024 FF Warrants 

First
May 2024 FF Warrant 

The
First May 2024 FF Warrant will be exercisable for up to 1,375,000 shares of common stock from the date of issuance until the fifth anniversary
of the date of issuance. The holder may exercise the First May 2024 FF Warrant by a cashless exercise if the Market Price
(as defined below) is less than the exercise price then in effect and there is no effective registration statement for the resale of
the shares. The Market Price is defined as the highest traded price of the common stock during the 30 trading days before
the date of the cashless exercise. The number of shares issuable upon cashless exercise will equal (i) the product of (a) the number
of shares of common stock that the holder elects to purchase under the First May 2024 FF Warrant, times (b) the Market Price less the
exercise price, divided by (ii) the Market Price. 

Under
the First May 2024 FF Warrant, the holder of the First May 2024 FF Warrant may at any time and from time to time, subject to the FF Beneficial
Ownership Limitation and the FF Exchange Limitation (before the FF Stockholder Approval was obtained), exercise the First May 2024 FF
Warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of 0.30 per share, subject to adjustment, including adjustments
under full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions for any issuances of securities at a lower price per share or per underlying share of common
stock other than for an Excluded Issuance, or for any issuances of securities at a price which varies or may vary with the market price
of the common stock, to match the price of such lower-priced or variable-priced securities, or for other dilution events. Simultaneous
with any adjustment to the exercise price as a result of an anti-dilution adjustment, the number of shares underlying the First May 2024
FF Warrant will be adjusted proportionately so that after such adjustment the aggregate exercise price payable under the First May 2024
FF Warrant for the adjusted number of shares underlying the First May 2024 FF Warrant will be the same as the aggregate exercise price
in effect immediately prior to such adjustment (without regard to any limitations on exercise). The First May 2024 FF Warrant also contains
rights to any rights to purchase securities of the Company distributed pro rata to the stockholders of the Company. 

Second
May 2024 FF Warrant 

The
Second May 2024 FF Warrant was exercisable for up to 250,000 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of 0.01 per share from
the date (the Second FF Warrants Trigger Date of an FF Notes Event of Default until the fifth anniversary of the Second
FF Warrants Trigger Date, subject to the FF Beneficial Ownership Limitation and the FF Exchange Limitation. The Second May 2024 FF Warrant
would have been automatically canceled if the May 2024 FF Note had been fully repaid in cash prior to any FF Notes Event of Default.
The Second May 2024 FF Warrant otherwise had the same terms and conditions as the First May 2024 FF Warrant. 

On
September 19, 2024, the remaining balance of the May 2024 FF Note was converted into shares of common stock. The Second May 2024 FF Warrant
is therefore no longer exercisable. 

The
May 2024 FF Note, the First May 2024 FF Warrant, the Second May 2024 FF Warrant, the May 2024 FF Purchase Agreement, the May 2024 FF
Security Agreement, the May 2024 FF Registration Rights Agreement, and the Amendment to May 2024 FF Note and May 2024 FF Warrants were

Amendment to May 2024 FF Transaction Documents provided that neither the Company s execution of the June 2024 FF Purchase Agreement
and the related transaction documents, nor the Company s issuance of securities to FirstFire pursuant to the June 2024 FF Purchase
Agreement and the related transaction documents, will cause a breach of any provision of the May 2024 FF Purchase Agreement or an FF
Notes Event of Default. The Amendment to May 2024 FF Transaction Documents further provided that the issuance of the June 2024 FF Note
was permitted, and that the June 2024 FF Note will be pari passu in priority to the May 2024 FF Note, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the May 2024 FF Purchase Agreement or the May 2024 FF Note. In addition, the original May 2024 FF Purchase Agreement was
amended to delete a provision that, upon meeting certain terms and conditions, at the Company s option, FirstFire would be required
to fund the purchase price of at least an additional 175,000 under the same terms and conditions as the May 2024 FF Purchase Agreement
and related transaction documents.

52 

June
2024 FF Purchase Agreement 

Under
the June 2024 FF Purchase Agreement, until the June 2024 FF Note was fully converted or repaid, the June 2024 FF Note holder had participation
rights and rights of first refusal on any offers of the Company s securities other than offerings previously disclosed in the Company s
reports filed with the SEC or any Excluded Issuance, and most favored nation rights on any offers of the Company s securities other
than for an Excluded Issuance. The Company was also prohibited from effecting or entering into an agreement involving a Variable Rate
Transaction other than pursuant to an at-the-market agreement with a registered broker-dealer, whereby such registered
broker-dealer would be acting as principal in the purchase of common stock from the Company or an Equity Line of Credit, without the
consent of FirstFire, not to be unreasonably withheld. In addition, the Company was required not to issue or agree, propose, or offer
to issue any shares of common stock or securities with underlying common stock prior to the 30 th calendar day after the date
of the June 2024 FF Purchase Agreement other than an Excluded Issuance. 

The
June 2024 FF Purchase Agreement (as well as the June 2024 FF Note and the June 2024 FF Warrants) provided that the maximum amount of
shares of common stock issuable under the June 2024 FF Note and the June 2024 FF Warrants was limited to the FF Exchange Limitation until
the we had obtained the FF Stockholder Approval. The Company was required to hold a meeting of stockholders on or before the date that
was six months after the date of the June 2024 FF Purchase Agreement, for the purpose of obtaining the FF Stockholder Approval, with
the recommendation of the Company s board of directors that such proposal be approved; the Company was required to solicit proxies
from the Company s stockholders in connection with the proposal in the same manner as all other management proposals in such proxy
statement; and all management-appointed proxyholders must vote their proxies in favor of such proposal. In addition, all members of the
Company s board of directors and all of the Company s executive officers were required to vote in favor of such proposal,
for purposes of obtaining the FF Stockholder Approval, with respect to all of the Company s securities then held by such persons,
and the Company was generally required to use the Company s commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the FF Stockholder Approval.
If the Company had not obtained the FF Stockholder Approval at the first meeting at which the proposal was voted upon, the Company was
required to call a stockholder meeting as often as possible thereafter to seek the FF Stockholder Approval until the FF Stockholder Approval
was obtained. 

On
September 18, 2024, 2024 Annual Meeting was held. At the 2024 Annual Meeting, the stockholders approved a proposal to approve the issuance
of all of the shares of common stock, issued or issuable pursuant to the May 2024 FF Purchase Agreement, the June 2024 FF Purchase Agreement,
and the Boustead Engagement Letter, in connection with the May 2024 FF Purchase Agreement and the June 2024 FF Purchase Agreement, in
accordance with Section 713(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide. As a result, the FF Stockholder Approval was obtained. 

June
2024 FF Registration Rights Agreement 

As
required by the June 2024 FF Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of June 18, 2024,
between the Company and FirstFire (the June 2024 FF Registration Rights Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed
to register the resale of the June 2024 FF Commitment Shares and the shares of common stock underlying the June 2024 FF Note and the
June 2024 FF Warrants under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement. The Company agreed to file the registration statement
with the SEC within 90 calendar days from the date of the June 2024 FF Purchase Agreement and to have the registration statement declared
effective by the SEC within 120 days from the date of the June 2024 FF Purchase Agreement. The Company also granted FirstFire certain
piggyback registration rights pursuant to the June 2024 FF Purchase Agreement. A registration statement was filed with the SEC on July
5, 2024 in order to comply with these requirements. Pursuant to the June 2024 FF Registration Rights Agreement, if the total number of
shares issuable upon conversion of the June 2024 FF Note or upon exercise of the June 2024 FF Warrants becomes greater than the number
that may be offered for resale by means of the prospectus that forms a part of such registration statement, then the Company will be
required to register the additional shares of common stock for resale by means of one or more separate prospectuses. 

June
2024 FF Note 

The
principal amount of the June 2024 FF Note was based on an original issue discount of 10 and interest at the rate of 10 per annum on
a 365-day basis. The interest was guaranteed, which required that the first 12 months of interest (equal to approximately 19,861) be
paid. The June 2024 FF Note was to mature on the earlier of the 12-month anniversary date of the issuance date, or June 18, 2025, and
the date of the consummation of a sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the consolidation,
merger or other business combination of the Company with or into any other entity when the Company is not the survivor. 

53 

Under
the June 2024 FF Note, the Company was required to make eight monthly amortization payments of approximately 27,309 each, commencing
October 18, 2024, and pay the entire remaining outstanding balance on June 18, 2025. The Company was permitted to prepay the June 2024
FF Note any time prior to an FF Notes Event of Default on 15 trading days prior written notice for an amount equal to 110 of
the principal amount then outstanding and 110 of the accrued and unpaid interest outstanding. 

Under
the June 2024 FF Note, the holder of the June 2024 FF Note was permitted, at any time and from time to time, subject to the FF Beneficial
Ownership Limitation and the FF Exchange Limitation (before the FF Stockholder Approval was obtained), to convert the outstanding principal
amount and accrued interest under the June 2024 FF Note into shares of common stock at the initial FF Notes Fixed Conversion Price. If
the Company failed to make an amortization payment when due under the June 2024 FF Note, the balance remaining under the June 2024 FF
Note would have become convertible, and the conversion price would have become the lower of the then-applicable FF Notes Fixed Conversion
Price and 80 of the lowest closing price of the common stock during the ten trading days prior to the date of a conversion of the June
2024 FF Note. If an FF Notes Event of Default had occurred, then the balance remaining under the June 2024 FF Note would have become
convertible at the lower of the FF Notes Fixed Conversion Price, the closing price of the common stock on the date of the FF Notes Event
of Default (or the next trading day if such date is not on a trading day), and 0.195 per share. 

An
FF Notes Event of Default would have occurred upon the occurrence of any of the following: The failure to pay obligations when due; failure
to issue shares upon conversions as required; a material breach of representations and warranties or covenants; the entry of material
judgments against certain of the Company s subsidiaries; the initiation of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings of certain of the
Company s subsidiaries; defaults on other indebtedness; failure to remain subject to and compliant with the Exchange Act; failure
to maintain intellectual property and other necessary assets; the restatement of any financial statements; disclosure or attempted disclosure
of material non-public information to the June 2024 FF Note holder; unavailability of Rule 144 for resales of the Company s securities
on or after six months from the issuance date of the June 2024 FF Note; and the delisting or suspension of listing of the Company s
common stock by the NYSE American. The occurrence of an FF Notes Event of Default would have resulted in a number of additional obligations
to the June 2024 FF Note holder, including acceleration and multiplication by 125 of the June 2024 FF Note balance; default interest
at the rate of the lesser of (i) 15 per annum and (ii) the maximum amount permitted by law from the due date thereof until the same
is paid; and the increase of the principal balance of the June 2024 FF Note by 3,000 each calendar month until the June 2024 FF Note
is repaid in its entirety. 

If
at any time prior to the full repayment or full conversion of all amounts owed under the June 2024 FF Note the Company had received cash
proceeds from any source or series of related or unrelated sources on or after the date of the June 2024 FF Note, including but not limited
to, payments from customers, the issuance of equity or debt, the incurrence of Indebtedness, a merchant cash advance, sale of receivables
or similar transaction, the exercise of outstanding warrants of the Company, the issuance of securities pursuant to an Equity Line of
Credit of the Company or the Company s offering of securities under Regulation A under the Securities Act, or the Company s
sale of assets (including but not limited to real property), the Company was required, within one business day of the Company s
receipt of such proceeds, to inform the holder of the June 2024 FF Note of or publicly disclose such receipt, following which the holder
of the June 2024 FF Note had the right in its sole discretion to require the Company to immediately apply up to 100 of such proceeds
to repay all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount and interest (including any default interest) then due under the June
2024 FF Note, not including any such proceeds used to repay the May 2024 FF Note. The 110 prepayment premium would have applied to any
repayment of the June 2024 FF Note pursuant to this requirement prior to the occurrence of an FF Notes Event of Default. 

The
June 2024 FF Note was a senior secured obligation of the Company, with priority over all existing and future indebtedness of the Company,
except that the June 2024 FF Note provided that it was pari passu in priority to the May 2024 FF Note, and junior in priority to the
Second CBAZ Promissory Note. The June 2024 FF Note prohibited the Company from incurring any Indebtedness that is senior to or pari passu
with the obligations under the June 2024 FF Note. During the period that any obligation under the June 2024 FF Note remained outstanding,
the Company was prohibited, without the June 2024 FF Note holder s prior written consent, from declaring or paying any dividends
or other distributions on shares of capital stock except in the form of shares of common stock or distributions pursuant to a stockholders 
rights plan approved by a majority of the Company s disinterested directors. The Company also was prohibited from repurchasing
any capital stock or repaying any indebtedness other than the May 2024 FF Note and the Second CBAZ Promissory Note while the Company
had any obligation under the June 2024 FF Note and the Second CBAZ Promissory Note while the Company had any obligation under the June
2024 FF Note without FirstFire s written consent. The Company was also prohibited from (a) changing the nature of its business;
(b) selling, divesting, changing the structure of any material assets other than in the ordinary course of business; (c) entering into
a Variable Rate Transaction; or (d) entering into any merchant cash advance transaction, sale of receivables transaction, or any other
similar transaction, without the consent of FirstFire, which could not be unreasonably withheld. The June 2024 FF Note also contained
a most favored nations provision with respect to the issuance of any debt securities of the Company. 

54 

On
September 19, 2024, FirstFire converted the entire balance under the May 2024 FF Note of 218,472 into 728,240 shares of common stock
at the FF Notes Fixed Conversion Price 0.30 per share).

adjustments under full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions for any issuances of securities at a lower price per share or per underlying
share of common stock other than for an Excluded Issuance, or for any issuances of securities at a price which varies or may vary with
the market price of the common stock, to match the price of such lower-priced or variable-priced securities, or for other dilution events.
Simultaneous with any adjustment to the exercise price as a result of an anti-dilution adjustment, the number of shares underlying the
First June 2024 FF Warrant will be adjusted proportionately so that after such adjustment the aggregate exercise price payable under
the First June 2024 FF Warrant for the adjusted number of shares underlying the First June 2024 FF Warrant will be the same as the aggregate
exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment (without regard to any limitations on exercise). The First June 2024 FF

Leases 

The
Company leases its corporate offices consisting of approximately 3,154 square feet under a lease agreement dated November 1, 2022, as
amended by an addendum dated November 2, 2022 (the Amendment to Office Lease ), and as further amended under a first amendment
to lease dated April 1, 2023 (as amended, the Office Lease ). The Office Lease s initial term from November 1, 2022
to April 30, 2023 was extended for a 39-month term beginning on May 4, 2023 and ending on August 3, 2026. Under the Office Lease, rent
for the first month was 6,742 and was 7,491 for each subsequent month through April 2023, plus applicable rental taxes, sales taxes,
and operating expenses. Monthly rent was 7,359 from May 4, 2023 to May 3, 2024, abated for the first three months of this period; and
will be 7,580 from May 4, 2024 to May 3, 2025; 7,808 from May 4, 2025 to May 3, 2026; and 8,042 from May 4, 2026 to August 3, 2026,
plus applicable rental taxes. Parking fees were 290.50 for the first month and will be 325.00 for each subsequent month. The Company
also paid an initial security deposit of 8,000 in November 2022 and a second security deposit of 16,000 in May 2023. The initial security
deposit will be refunded and credited toward monthly rent for the months beginning May 4, 2024 and May 4, 2025 if the Company has performed
all obligations under the Office Lease, including making all rent payments when due. The Company may exercise a one-time option to extend
the Office Lease for an additional three-year term upon 9-12 months notice for the fair market rent at the time of the extension,
as determined in accordance with the Office Lease, and which will not be less than 103 of the final rent amount under the current term.
Under the Office Lease, the Company must pay for any tenant improvements above the allowance provided for such improvements of 37,848
or that are not in compliance with the terms of the amended lease agreement. 

The
Office Lease and the Amendment to Office Lease were filed as Exhibit 10.12 and Exhibit 10.22 to the 2023 Annual Report, respectively,
and the description above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such exhibits. 

The
Company also leased office space under a lease agreement that expired on May 31, 2023. Monthly rent was 12,075 and included annual escalations.
In December 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sublease its office space. The sublease ended on May 31, 2023 and included
fixed rent of 9,894 per month. 

Common
Stock Purchase Agreement 

Under
a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of January 5, 2024 (the Tumim Purchase Agreement ), and a Registration Rights
Agreement, dated as of January 5, 2024 (the Tumim Registration Rights Agreement ), each between the Company and Tumim Stone
Capital LLC Tumim ), Tumim had committed to purchase, upon the terms and conditions specified in the Tumim Purchase Agreement
and the Tumim Registration Rights Agreement, up to 25 million of the Company s common stock. Under the Tumim Purchase Agreement,
we sold a total of 114,496 shares of common stock to Tumim at an average price per share of approximately 0.44 for aggregate gross proceeds
of 50,627. 

As
consideration for Tumim s commitment to purchase shares of common stock upon the terms of and subject to satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in the Tumim Purchase Agreement, on the date of the initial filing with the SEC of the registration statement to register under
the Securities Act the offer and resale by Tumim of all of the shares of common stock that may be issued and sold by the Company to Tumim
from time to time under the Tumim Purchase Agreement pursuant to the Tumim Registration Rights Agreement (the Tumim Registration
Statement ), the Company was required to pay 500,000 in cash or issue to Tumim shares of common stock as consideration for its
commitment to purchase shares of our common stock from time to time at our direction under the Tumim Purchase Agreement (the Tumim
Commitment Shares in an amount valued at 500,000 in the aggregate, subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of 4.99 of
the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock beneficially owned by Tumim and its affiliates (as calculated pursuant to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 13d-3 promulgated thereunder) (the Tumim Beneficial Ownership Limitation ).
The per share value of the Tumim Commitment Shares was required to be calculated by dividing (i) a 500,000 commitment fee (the Tumim
Commitment Fee ), by (ii) the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices VWAPs during the five consecutive
trading day period ending on (and including) the trading day immediately prior to the date of the initial filing of the Tumim Registration
Statement. If any shares that were otherwise required to be issued as Tumim Commitment Shares were not permitted to be issued due to
the Tumim Beneficial Ownership Limitation, the Company was required to pay to Tumim in cash the amount equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares that may not be issued as Tumim Commitment Shares due to the Tumim Beneficial Ownership Limitation and (ii) the average
of the daily VWAPs during the five consecutive trading day period ending on (and including) the trading day immediately prior to the
date of the initial filing of the Tumim Registration Statement. Accordingly, on the date of the initial filing with the SEC of the Tumim
Registration Statement, the Company issued 661,102 shares of common stock as the Tumim Commitment Shares to Tumim, which were valued
at 470,360.45 in the aggregate, based on the average of the daily VWAPs during the five consecutive trading day period ending on (and
including) the trading day immediately prior to the date of the initial filing of the Tumim Registration Statement, which constituted
approximately 4.99 of the outstanding shares of common stock, and, due to the Tumim Beneficial Ownership Limitation and pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Tumim Purchase Agreement summarized above, we paid Tumim 29,639.55 in cash, which equaled the value
of the Tumim Commitment Shares that would have been issued but for the application of the Tumim Beneficial Ownership Limitation. In addition,
as required under the Tumim Purchase Agreement, the Company reimbursed Tumim for the reasonable legal fees and disbursements of Tumim s
legal counsel in the amount of 75,000. 

58 

On
May 16, 2024, the Company and Tumim agreed by mutual written consent and pursuant to its terms to terminate the Tumim Purchase Agreement,
effective immediately. 

In connection
with this termination, Tumim also waived the prohibition under the Tumim Purchase Agreement on the Company entering into a transaction
defined as a Variable Rate Transaction under the Tumim Purchase Agreement, which otherwise would have survived termination
of the Tumim Purchase Agreement for a six-month period. 

Under
the Boustead Engagement Letter, Boustead acted as the placement agent in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Tumim Purchase
Agreement. We agreed to issue Boustead 49,193 shares of common stock in connection with our issuance of the Tumim Commitment Shares to
Tumim on January 26, 2024, equal to 7 of the number of Tumim Commitment Shares that would have been issued but for the application of
the Tumim Beneficial Ownership Limitation, as a fee pursuant to the Boustead Engagement Letter. Under the Boustead Engagement Letter,
the Company was also required to pay Boustead cash in the amount of 8 in aggregate of the amount actually paid by Tumim to the Company
pursuant to the Tumim Purchase Agreement. The Company was also required to issue to Boustead warrants to purchase a number of shares
equal to 7 of the shares of common stock issued to Tumim pursuant to purchases under the Tumim Purchase Agreement, with an exercise
price equal to the applicable purchase price per share. In March 2024, we therefore issued Boustead warrants to purchase up to 8,014 shares
of common stock in aggregate with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately 0.44 per share. The warrants that were required
to be issued to Boustead will be exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issuance and contain cashless exercise provisions.
Boustead also has certain registration rights with respect to these warrants. Boustead and its affiliates are not in any manner related
to Tumim or any of Tumim s affiliates. Boustead s compensation under the Boustead Engagement Letter in connection with the
Tumim Purchase Agreement is subject to reduction or adjustment to the extent that such compensation is determined to be in excess of
or otherwise noncompliant with applicable rules of FINRA. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires our management
to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of
commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our
financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations.
Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations
and require management s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive
because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ
significantly from management s current judgments. 

See
Note 1 Principal Business Activity and Significant Accounting Policies in the financial statements included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of our other significant accounting policies. We believe the following critical accounting
policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements: 

Income
Taxes 

Income
taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred
taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of internally developed software and net operating loss and research and development
tax credit carry forwards for financial and income tax reporting. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return
consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

59 

The
Company converted to a C corporation in September 2021. As a limited liability company for the 2020 year and through the date of conversion
in 2021, the Company s taxable loss was allocated to members in accordance with their respective percentage of ownership. Therefore,
no provision for income taxes has been included in the financial statements for the period prior to the Company s conversion to
a C corporation. 

The
Company evaluates its tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on income tax returns to determine if an accrual
is necessary for uncertain tax positions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unrecognized tax benefits accrual was zero.
The Company will recognize future accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense if incurred.
As of September 30, 2024, the 2020 through 2023 tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and state authorities. 

Internally
Developed Software 

Software
consists of an internally developed information system for use by the Company in matching student-athletes with qualified coaches. The
Company has capitalized costs incurred with development and upgrades of the information systems in accordance with applicable accounting
standards. Costs incurred up to and including the feasibility stage of development as well as maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
The Company amortizes these capitalized costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset of five years. 

In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ASC 350-40, Internal-Use
Software, amortization of internal-use software should begin when the software is ready for its intended use. Software is ready
for its intended use after all substantial testing is completed. On January 1, 2023, all substantial testing of the Company s platform
for purposes of football recruitment was completed. Amortization of the platform s capitalized costs for purposes of football
recruitment therefore started on January 1, 2023, due to its ready-for-use status. 

In
accordance with ASC Subtopic 350-40-25, during the application development stage, some costs are capitalized while other costs are
expensed as incurred. In general, costs that are directly attributable to the development of the software are capitalized. The
Company s platform remained in the application development stage for soccer, baseball, and softball recruitment and additional feature
development and enhancements for purposes of football recruitment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023. Capitalized costs associated with the platform during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted
of fees paid to third parties for services provided to develop the software during the application development stage, costs incurred
to obtain computer software from third parties, and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with
and who devote time to the internal-use computer software project, to the extent of the time spent directly on the project. The
following other costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were incurred as expenses and were not
capitalized: Training costs, data conversion costs except for costs to develop or obtain software that allows for access or conversion
of old data by new systems, and general and administrative costs and overhead costs. 

The
Company periodically performs reviews of the recoverability of such capitalized technology costs. At the time a determination is made
that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on estimated cash flows to be generated from technology; any remaining capitalized
amounts are written off. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company wrote off net capitalized software
development costs of 0. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company accounts for revenue under the guidance of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts from Customers ASC 606 ). 

60 

ASC
606 prescribes a five-step model that focuses on transfer of control and entitlement to payment when determining the amount of revenue
to be recognized. Under the ASC 606 guidance, an entity is required to perform the following five steps: 

(1)
identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price;
(4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity
satisfies a performance obligation. 

Revenue
from performance obligations satisfied at a point in time consist of sales to individuals representing a one-month subscription and are
recognized at the end of the subscription. 

Revenue
from performance obligations satisfied over time consists of the sale of subscription agreements to individual organizations or customers
that are more than one month in duration and are recognized on a monthly basis over the life of the subscription agreement. There were
 23,668 of open receivables at September 30, 2024 and 58,775 at December 31, 2023. 

In
accordance with ASC 606, contracts may be amended to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. Contract modifications
exist when the amendment either creates new, or changes existing, enforceable rights and obligations. When contract modifications create
new performance obligations and the increase in consideration approximates the standalone selling price for goods and services related
to such new performance obligations as adjusted for specific facts and circumstances of the contract, the modification is considered
to be a separate contract and revenue is recognized prospectively. If a contract modification is not accounted for as a separate contract,
the Company accounts for the promised goods or services not yet transferred at the date of the contract modification (the remaining promised
goods or services) prospectively, as if it were a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract, if the remaining
goods or services are distinct from the goods or services transferred on or before the date of the contract modification. The Company
accounts for a contract modification as if it were a part of the existing contract if the remaining goods or services are not distinct
and, therefore, form part of a single performance obligation that is partially satisfied at the date of the contract modification. In
such case the effect that the contract modification has on the transaction price, and on the entity s measure of progress toward
complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction
of revenue) at the date of the contract modification (the adjustment to revenue is made on a cumulative catch-up basis). 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs under the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC
Topic 718 ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense related to the fair value of stock-based compensation
awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Stock-based compensation expense recognized includes the compensation cost for all stock-based
payments granted to employees, consultants, officers, and directors based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of ASC Topic 718. ASC Topic 718 is also applied to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled during the periods reported.
Stock-based compensation is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite vesting period and over the nonemployee s
period of providing goods or services. The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for the cost of employee services received
in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. 

The
fair value of options on the grant date is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of certain
subjective assumptions including expected term, volatility, risk-free interest rate and the fair value of our common stock. These assumptions
generally require significant judgment. The resulting costs are recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide
service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. The Company amortizes the fair value of stock-based compensation on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service periods. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur as a reduction to stock-based
compensation expense and to additional paid-in-capital. 

Expected
term . Using the simplified method, the expected term is estimated as the midpoint of the expected time to vest and the contractual
term, as permitted by the SEC. For out-of-the-money option grants, we estimate the expected lives based on the midpoint of the expected
time to a liquidity event and the contractual term. 

Volatility .
With respect to grants of equity awards made prior to the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American on November 14, 2023, given
the absence of an active market for our common stock, the Company s expected volatility was derived from the historical volatilities
of several unrelated public companies in the digital media and social platform industries because we had little information on the volatility
of the price of our common stock because we had no trading history. When making the selections of our industry peer companies to be used
in the volatility calculation, we consider operational area, size, business model, industry and the business of potential comparable
companies. These historical volatilities are weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility
factor. With respect to grants of equity awards made after the listing, the Company determines the expected volatility by weighing the
historical average volatilities of publicly traded industry peers and its own trading history. The Company intends to continue to consistently
apply this methodology using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility
of the Company s own common stock price becomes available, unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no
longer similar to the Company, in which case more suitable companies whose stock prices are publicly available would be utilized in the
calculation. 

61 

Risk
free rate . The risk free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected
term of the options for each option group. 

Dividend
yield . The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and does not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable
future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero. 

Fair
Value of Common Stock. With respect to equity grants made before the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American on November
14, 2023, given the absence of an active market for our common stock, the estimated fair value of restricted stock grants and common
stock underlying grants of stock options was determined using a modified probability-weighted expected return methodology PWERM ).
For valuations after our listing on November 14, 2023, the fair value of restricted stock grants and common stock underlying grants of
stock options is calculated utilizing the daily closing price as reported by the NYSE American. 

If
in the future the Company determines that another method is more reasonable, or if another method for calculating these input assumptions
is prescribed by authoritative guidance, and, therefore, should be used to estimate volatility or expected life, the fair value calculated
for our stock options could change significantly. Higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to stock-based compensation
expense determined at the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expenses affect our general and administrative expenses. 

The
following table presents, on a weighted average basis, the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the
grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2023:

Independent
Third-Party Valuation 

A
third-party independent valuation firm s valuation report concluded that as of August 31, 2022, which the Company considered representative
of the fair value of the underlying common stock of the options granted on September 9, 2022 and September 28, 2022 and modified on October
18, 2022 as described above, the fair value of the Company s common stock was 1.74 per share. The valuation report as of August
31, 2022 applied a PWERM analysis that reflected a 45 probability that the Company would complete an initial public offering, and a
55 probability that the Company would continue to operate privately. The Company performed a retrospective analysis based on the valuation
on the financial statements previously issued and determined that any difference to stock compensation expense previously booked is not
material to the financial statements as a whole for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the three-month period ended March 31, 2023.
A valuation analysis as of March 31, 2023, which the Company considered representative of the fair value of the underlying common stock
of the options granted on March 14, 2023, April 5, 2023, April 11, 2023, April 19, 2023, May 3, 2023 and May 9, 2023, concluded that
the fair value of the Company s common stock was 2.22 per share. The valuation report as of March 31, 2023 applied a PWERM analysis
that reflected a 70 probability that the Company would complete an initial public offering and a 30 probability that the Company would
continue to operate privately. 

After
taking into consideration each PWERM analysis, the Company calculated the grant date fair value for financial reporting purposes of grants
of options and restricted stock prior to the date of the listing of the Company s common stock on the NYSE American on November
14, 2023 based on additional factors not taken into account by the valuation reports.

to which the Company is a party or of which any of their property is the subject. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Our
current liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity, and we could have difficulty fulfilling our financial
obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on us . 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities totaling approximately 2.682 million, compared to approximately
 1,000 in cash and cash equivalents. Our current level of indebtedness and other financial obligations increases the risk that we may
be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness and other financial obligations. The level of
our indebtedness and other financial obligations could have other important consequences on our business, including: 

making
 it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to indebtedness and other
 financial obligations; 

increasing
 our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry, and competitive conditions; 

requiring
 us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to make payments on
 our indebtedness and other financial obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our
 cash flows to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes; 

limiting
 our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry
 in which we operate; 

restricting
 us from capitalizing on business opportunities; 

placing
 us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and other
 financial obligations; 

limiting
 our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, acquisitions, debt service requirements,
 execution of our business strategy, or other general corporate purposes; 

requiring
 us to provide additional credit support, such as letters of credit or other financial guarantees,
 to our customers or suppliers, thereby limiting our availability of funds; 

limiting
 our ability to enter into certain commercial arrangements because of concerns of counterparty
 risks; and 

limiting
 our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage
 compared to our competitors that have less debt. 

The
occurrence of any one or more of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Our
ability to pay off our indebtedness and other financial obligations depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance,
which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business, and other factors (many of which are beyond
our control), including the availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets. We cannot be certain that our
business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable
us to pay off our indebtedness and other financial obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs. 

If
we are unable to meet our debt and other financial obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance
all or a portion of our debt and other financial obligations. Failure to successfully restructure or refinance our debt and other financial
obligations could cause us to default on our debt and other financial obligations and would impair our liquidity. Our ability to restructure
or refinance our debt and other financial obligations will depend on the condition of the capital markets, which is outside of our control,
and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt and other financial obligations could be at higher interest rates
and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. 

64 

Moreover,
in the event that we fail to make a required payment on our debt and other financial obligations when due, if not cured or waived, the
affected creditor could elect to declare all the funds borrowed or owed to be immediately due and payable, together with accrued and
unpaid interest. Our assets or cash flows may not be sufficient to fully pay off debt and other financial obligations upon such demand.
Any failure to repay our indebtedness or other financial obligations when due, if not cured or waived, could force us into bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, or liquidation. 

We
will need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to obtain the necessary financing or fail to become profitable
or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations and be forced to significantly
delay, scale back or discontinue our operations or explore other strategies. 

Our
current cash runway is insufficient for us to be able to achieve or maintain positive cash flow. We have incurred losses for each period
from our inception and a significant accumulated deficit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net loss was approximately
 5.413 million and approximately 2.676 million, respectively, and our net cash used in operating activities was approximately 3.489
million and approximately 1.497 million, respectively. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our net loss was approximately
 5.478 million and approximately 6.674 million, respectively, and our cash used in operating activities was approximately 4.848 million
and approximately 4.928 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately
 22.372 million and approximately 16.959 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had total current liabilities of approximately
 2.605 million, compared to approximately 1,000 in cash and cash equivalents. 

As
a result of our critical financial condition, we are actively seeking to raise funds, primarily to pay off existing indebtedness and
accounts payable to avoid loan defaults, lawsuits, bankruptcy, and liquidation, rather than for growth or expansion. Even if we are successful
in this regard, we will require substantial additional capital to fund our planned operations, and if we fail to obtain necessary financing,
our business plans may not be successful. 

Our
ability to obtain the necessary financing to carry out our operating plans or remain in operation is subject to a number of factors,
including general market conditions and investor acceptance of our business model. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and
conditions of such financing unattractive or unavailable to us. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds on acceptable terms, we will
have to significantly reduce our spending, delay or cancel our planned activities, substantially change our corporate or capital structure,
terminate major unprofitable business operations that have defined our company since inception, and sell the related assets. Any of these
contingency plans may at minimum change our business focus to one with which you do not agree or that may not meet your investment objectives,
and if they are not successful, we may be forced into bankruptcy or dissolution and your investment could lose all value.
