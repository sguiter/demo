The remaining OP Units, consisting exclusively of limited partner interests, are held by persons who contributed their interests in properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units. Under the LLLP Agreement and the individual s respective redemption plan, these persons have the right to request the Operating Partnership redeem their OP Units following a specified restricted period. All redemptions are at the sole discretion of the Trust, acting for itself or in its capacity as General Partner of the Operating Partnership, and further subject to the conditions and limitations of the LLLP Agreement and redemption plans, as the same may be amended or modified from time to time. If the Trust accepts a redemption request, the redemption of OP Units shall be made in cash in an amount equal to the fair value of an equivalent number of common shares of the Trust. In lieu of delivering cash, however, the Trust, as the Operating Partnership s general partner, may, at its option and in its sole and absolute discretion, choose to acquire any OP Units so tendered by issuing common shares in exchange for the tendered OP Units. If the Trust so chooses, its common shares will be exchanged for OP Units on a one-for-one basis. This one-for-one exchange ratio is subject to adjustment to prevent dilution. With each such exchange or redemption, the Trust s percentage ownership in the Operating Partnership will increase. In addition, whenever the Trust issues common or other classes of its shares, it contributes the net proceeds it receives from the issuance to the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership issues to the Trust an equal number of OP Units or other partnership

 reportable segments: residential and commercial properties. Our residential properties include multifamily properties. Our commercial properties include retail, office, industrial, restaurant and medical properties. We assess and measure operating results based on net operating income NOI ), which we define as total real estate segment revenues less real estate expenses (which consist of real estate taxes, property management fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, and property administrative and management fees). We believe NOI is an important measure of operating performance even though it should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities. NOI is unaffected by financing, depreciation, amortization, legal and professional fees, and certain general and administrative expenses. The accounting policies of each segment are consistent with those described in Note 2 of this report. Segment Revenues and Net Operating Income The revenues and net operating income for the reportable segments (residential and commercial) are summarized as follows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, along with reconciliations to the consolidated financial statements.

 Derivative assets Financial liabilities: Line of Credit Mortgage notes payable Note payable ASC 820-10 established a three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement. Management uses these valuation techniques to establish the fair value of the assets at the measurement date. These valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect management s assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; Level 3 Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable. The guidance requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

 December 31, 2023 Derivative assets Derivatives: The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected future cash flows of the derivative. The Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered any applicable credit enhancements. Fair Value Disclosures The following table presents the Trust s financial assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value for disclosure purposes, by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which they fall. Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these instruments are described after the table. Mortgage notes payable Note payable Notes receivable December 31, 2023 Mortgage notes payable Notes receivable Line of credit: The Trust estimates the fair value of its line of credit approximates the carrying value due to the relatively short maturity of the instruments and that they carry a variable rate of interest. Mortgage notes payable: The Trust estimates the fair value of its mortgage notes payable by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently offered to the Trust for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities by the Trust s lenders. The rates used range from to and from to at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Note payable: The Trust estimates the fair value of its note payable approximates the carrying value due to the relatively short maturity of the instruments and that they carry a variable rate of interest.

 at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. of our revenues from residential leases that are generally for terms of one year or less. The residential leases may include lease income related items such as parking, storage and non-refundable deposits that we treat as a single lease component because the amenities cannot be leased on their own and the timing and pattern of revenue recognition are the same. The collection of lease payments at lease commencement is probable and therefore we subsequently recognize lease income over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Residential leases are renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis. As of September 30, 2024, we derived of our revenues from commercial leases primarily under long-term lease agreements. Substantially all commercial leases contain fixed escalations or, in some instances, changes based on the Consumer Price Index, which occur at specified times during the term of the lease. In certain commercial leases, variable lease income, such as percentage rent, is recognized when rents are earned. We recognize rental income and rental abatements from our commercial leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Recognition of rental income commences when control of the leased space has been transferred to the tenant. We recognize variable income from pass-through expenses on an accrual basis over the periods in which the expenses were incurred. Pass-through expenses are comprised of real estate taxes, operating expenses and common area maintenance costs which are reimbursed by tenants in accordance with specific allowable costs per tenant lease agreements. When we pay pass-through expenses, subject to reimbursement by the tenant, they are included within operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes, and reimbursements are included within real estate rental income along with the associated base rent in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Overview Sterling Real Estate Trust d/b/a Sterling Multifamily Trust Sterling , the Trust or the Company is a registered, but unincorporated business trust organized in North Dakota in December 2002. Sterling has elected to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code, which requires that 75 of the assets of a REIT consist of real estate assets and that 75 of its gross income be derived from real estate. The net income of the REIT is allocated in accordance with the stock ownership in the same fashion as a regular corporation. Our real estate portfolio consisted of 178 properties containing 11,955 apartment units and approximately 1,445,000 square feet of leasable commercial space as of September 30, 2024 . The portfolio has a net book value of real estate investments (cost less accumulated depreciation) of 861,509, which includes construction in progress. Sterling s current acquisition strategy and focus is on multifamily apartment properties.

 Critical Accounting Estimates Below are accounting policies and estimates that management believes are critical to the preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Certain accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this Report. A summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in the aforementioned notes to our consolidated financial statements (see Note 2 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements). These policies require the application of judgment and assumptions by management and, as a result, are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Due to this uncertainty, actual results could differ materially from estimates calculated and utilized by management. Impairment of Real Estate Investments The Trust will review each property within its portfolio, every quarter for potential impairment through various screening mechanisms (identifiers) to determine if there are indicators of impairment on a property. If so, the property is further analyzed through an undiscounted cash flow test. An identifier is not an indicator or triggering event for impairment; however, it is a mechanism to highlight an item on a property, which warrants further consideration and analysis to determine if an indicator is present. The following are examples of activities that are reviewed quarterly: An individual property s weighted average cost of capital is not meeting its required rate as calculated by management. Significant decline in Operational NOI (revenue minus the following: operating expenses, expensed projects, real estate taxes, and insurance) in relation to individual residential properties. Significant decline in NOI (revenue minus all operating expenses) in relation to individual commercial properties. Significant quarter over quarter decrease in occupancy. Properties with negative undiscounted cash flows. If the presence of one or more impairment identifiers is noted through a screening mechanism at the end of the reporting period or throughout the year with respect to an investment property, the asset is further analyzed to determine if an indicator of impairment exists. If further analysis does not explain the property s performance, the Trust considers this to provide evidence that an indicator of impairment does exist, the property is then subject to additional impairment analysis, and an undiscounted cash flow analysis is performed on the individual property. Indicators of impairment include: Sustained reduction in cash flows/NOI that was not due to a planned action taken by the Company to improve long term operations and where discussion and review with the Portfolio management team cannot support a significant decline or insufficient NOI Coverage. 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 Additionally, Sterling considers certain occurrences at a property to be a triggering event, causing an analysis of impairment to occur, and an undiscounted cash flow analysis is performed. Triggering events of impairment include: Continued difficulty in leasing property or renewing existing leases. Factors considered include: Competitors building significantly new properties. Competitors are relocating out of the area. Tenant downsizing and needing less square footage. Significant decrease in market prices not in line with general market trends. Property make-up of units is not in line with market trends. Demographics of property. A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition. A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset (asset group), including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The term more likely than not refers to a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent. As such, any property approved by the Board of Trustees to be sold, will be evaluated for impairment. To the extent impairment has occurred, the Trust will record an impairment charge calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Based on our evaluation, there were no impairment losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There have been no material changes in our Critical Accounting Policies as disclosed in Note 2 to our financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included elsewhere in this report. Acquisition of Real Estate Investments The Company allocates the purchase price of properties that meet the definition of an asset acquisition to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their relative fair values. In making estimates of relative fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, included independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The Company also considered information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. REIT Status We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes as least 90 of its REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains, as a distribution to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We intend to distribute to our shareholders 100 of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, we would fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result.

Residential properties acquired since January 1, 2024 contributed approximately 3,182 to the increase in total residential revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The remaining increase is due to increased rent charges at our stabilized properties. Residential revenues comprised 88.0 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 85.6 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 total commercial revenues decreased 250 or 4.8 in comparison to the same period for 2023. The decrease is primarily attributed to an increase in bad debt expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Commercial revenues comprised 12.0 of the total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.4 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Due to the sale of commercial properties, it is anticipated that the decline in commercial revenues as a percentage of total revenues will continue. Expenses Residential expenses from operations of 20,215 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1,702 or 9.2 in comparison to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributed to a 362 or 11.1 increase in real estate taxes. Property management increased 887 or 22.1 and utilities increased 365, or 16.1 . Properties acquired after January 1, 2024, account for 347 and 206 of such increases in property management fees and utilities, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Commercial expenses from operations of 1,572 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 56 or 3.7 in comparison to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributed to a 110 or 30 increase in repairs in maintenance. The increase is partially offset by the three disposed commercial properties which accounted for decreases of 17 and 27 for real estate taxes and utilities, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense of 6,577 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1,200 or 22.3 in comparison to the same period in 2023. Interest expense related to financing activities increased by 1,031 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The primary reason for increased interest expense on financing activities is due to the new interest on the Urban Plains and Lexington Lofts mortgage of 1,032. Overall interest expense will decrease as more debt is paid down. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 interest expense was 15.9 of total revenues. Depreciation and amortization expense of 7,622 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1,632 or 27.2 in comparison to the same period in 2023. Properties acquired in 2024 contribute approximately 1,728 to the increase in the expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This is offset by the properties disposed of in 2024 which contribute approximately 52 to the decrease in the expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Amortization expense will continue to decrease as lease intangibles become fully amortized but will increase upon acquisitions of intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of rental income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 18.4 and 16.6 , respectively. REIT administration expenses of 1,197 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 32 or 2.6 in comparison to the same period in 2023, due to 90 in legal fees in relation to the acquisition of the Stonefield property in Bismarck, North Dakota in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense of 213 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 53 or 33.1 in comparison to the same period in 2023. This is due to an increase in equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates and decrease in interest income. The decreases were partially offset by a realized gain on sale of real estate investments.

Table of Contents 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total commercial revenues decreased 330 or 2.1 in comparison to the same period for 2023. The decrease is attributed to the sale of three commercial buildings in 2024 resulting in a 90 decrease in revenue. The decrease is also attributed to the increase of bad debt expense for 210. Commercial revenues comprised 12.8 of the total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.4 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Expenses Residential expenses from operations of 58,694 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1,248 or 2.2 in comparison to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributed to an increase of 1,809 or 18.5 for real estate taxes, 1,983 or 16.8 for property management fees, and 878 or 22.7 for property insurance. The increase is offset by a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense of 3,004 or 12.9 due to deferred projects and repairs being completed in 2023. Properties acquired since January 1, 2024 contributed 381, 474, and 512 to the increase in repairs and maintenance, property management fees, and real estate taxes, respectively. Commercial expenses from operations of 4,313 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 347 or 7.4 in comparison to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily attributed to decreases in real estate taxes, utilities and repairs and maintenance of 157, 146, and 103, respectively during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the three disposed commercial buildings in 2024 attributed to the decrease in real estate taxes, utilities, and repairs and maintenance by 45, 27, and 11, respectively. Interest expense of 17,455 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1,391 or 8.7 in comparison to the same period in 2023. Interest expense related to financing activities increased by 1,366 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The primary reason for the increase in interest expense on financing activities is due to the increase of 1,275 of interest expense with the new Urbain Plains and Lexington Lofts mortgages. Overall interest expense will continue to decrease as debt is paid down. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense was 14.8 of total revenues. Depreciation and amortization expense of 20,564 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1,538 or 8.1 in comparison to the same period in 2023. The primary reason for the increase is attributed to depreciation on properties acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Amortization expense, however, will continue to decrease as lease intangibles become fully amortized. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of rental income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 at 17.4 and 17.8 , respectively. REIT administration expenses of 4,083 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 403 or 11.0 in comparison to the same period in 2023. The increase is due to a one-time advisory fee of 350 in 2024 as well as increased advisor fees, and external audit fees, of 130 and 33, respectively. This is partially offset by a decrease of 67 in legal fees. Other income of 1,982 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 580 or 41.3 in comparison to the same period in 2023 . This is primarily due to the increase of 473 related to conversion of real estate investments as well as an increase of 298 in equity in income of affiliates. This is offset by a decrease of 269 interest income during the year 2024 as compared to 2023. Construction in Progress and Development Projects The Trust capitalizes direct and certain indirect project costs incurred during the development period such as construction, insurance, architectural, legal, interest and other financing costs, and real estate taxes. At such time as the development is considered substantially complete, the capitalization of certain indirect costs such as real estate taxes, interest, and financing costs cease, and all project-related costs included in construction in process are reclassified to land and building and other improvements.

 Construction in progress as of September 30, 2024, consists primarily of construction at residential properties located in North Dakota and Minnesota. Rosedale Estates located in Roseville, MN has two projects for a parking structure and a parking lot. The parking structure is budgeted for 2,549, of which 2,256 has been incurred. The parking lot has a budget of 5,032, of which 3,341 has been incurred. Remaining construction in progress projects are primarily related to parking lot replacements, rehabs, window and patio replacements, roof upgrades, new CCTV cameras, and various property upgrades on multiple residential properties. Funds From Operations (FFO) Funds From Operations (FFO) applicable to common shares and limited partnership units means net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. FFO was created to address this problem. It was intended to be a standard supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excluded historical cost depreciation from or added back to GAAP net income. Our management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because it provides supplemental information that facilitates comparisons to prior periods and for the evaluation of financial results. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate our financial results, develop budgets and manage expenditures. The method used to produce non-GAAP results is not computed according to GAAP, is likely to differ from the methods used by other companies and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. Management encourages the review of the reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP results. Since the introduction of the definition of FFO, the term has come to be widely used by REITs. In the view of National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), the use of the definition of FFO (combined with the primary GAAP presentations required by the Securities and Exchange Commission) has been fundamentally beneficial, improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making it easier to compare the results of one REIT with another. While FFO applicable to common shares and limited partnership units are widely used by REITs as performance metrics, all REITs do not use the same definition of FFO or calculate FFO in the same way. The FFO reconciliation presented here is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate investment trusts. FFO should also not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of a real estate investment trust s performance, but rather should be considered as an additional, supplemental measure, and should be viewed in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this report. FFO applicable to common shares and limited partnership units does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund a real estate investment trust s needs or its ability to service indebtedness or to pay dividends to shareholders.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Evaluation of Liquidity We continually evaluate our liquidity and ability to fund future operations, debt obligations and any repurchase requests. As part of our analysis, we consider among other items, the credit quality of tenants, and current lease terms and projected expiration dates. Our principal demands for funds will be for the: (i) acquisition of real estate and real estate-related investments, (ii) payment of acquisition-related expenses and operating expenses, (iii) payment of dividends/distributions, (iv) payment of principal and interest on current and any future outstanding indebtedness, (v) redemptions of our securities under our redemption plans and (vi) capital improvements, development projects, and property related expenditures. Generally, we expect to meet cash needs for the payment of operating expenses and interest on outstanding indebtedness from cash flow from operations. We expect to pay dividends/distributions and any repurchase requests to our shareholders and the unit

 holders of our Operating Partnership from cash flow from operations; however, we may use other sources to fund dividends/distributions and repurchases, as necessary. As of September 30, 2024, our unrestricted cash resources consisted of cash and cash equivalents totaling 11,145. Our unrestricted cash reserves can be used for working capital needs and other commitments. In addition, we had unencumbered properties with a gross book value of 45,992, which could potentially be used as collateral to secure additional financing in future periods. The Trust maintains a 4,915 variable rate (floating SOFR plus 2.00 line of credit agreement with Bremer Bank, which expires in December 2026; and a 3,500 variable rate (floating SOFR plus 2.00 line of credit agreement with Bremer Bank, which also expires in December 2026. We also have a 14,800 variable rate (Prime minus 1.50 line of credit agreement with Gate City Bank, which expires in July 2029. The lines of credit are secured by specific properties. At September 30, 2024, the lines of credit have 23,215 available and an unused balance of 17,366 under the agreements. The Trust anticipates it will hold it as a cash resource to the Trust. The sale of our securities and issuance of limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership in exchange for property acquisitions and sale of additional common or preferred shares is also expected to be a source of long-term capital for the Trust. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 302,000 common shares in a private placement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 255,000 and 93,000 common shares under the dividend reinvestment plan and optional share purchases, respectively, which raised gross proceeds of 7,728. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any common shares in private placements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued 268,000 and 136,000 common shares under the dividend reinvestment plan and as optional share purchases, respectively, which raised gross proceeds of 8,983. Additionally, to reduce our cash investment and liquidity needs, the Trust utilizes the UPREIT structure whereby we can acquire property in whole or in part by issuing partnership units in lieu of cash payments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Trust issued approximately 322,000 limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership value at 23.00 per unit for an aggregate consideration of approximately 7,397 for the purchase of real estate investments. No limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership were issued in relation to the acquisition of real estate investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Board of Trustees, acting as general partner for the Operating Partnership, determined an estimate of fair value for the limited partnership units exchanged through the UPREIT structure. In determining this value, the Board relied upon their experience with, and knowledge about, the Trust s real estate portfolio and debt obligations. The Board typically determines the fair value on an annual basis. The Trustees determine the fair value, in their sole discretion and use data points to guide their determination which is typically based on a consensus of opinion. Thus, the Trust does not employ any specific valuation methodology or formula. Rather, the Board looks to available data and information, which is often adjusted and weighted to comport more closely with the assets held by the Trust at the time of valuation. The principal valuation methodology utilized is the NAV calculation/direct capitalization method. The information made available to the Board is assembled by the Trust s Advisor. In addition, the Board considers how the price chosen will affect existing share and unit values, redemption prices, dividend coverage ratios, yield percentages, dividend reinvestment factors, and future UPREIT transactions, among other considerations and information. The fair value was not determined based on, nor intended to comply with, fair value standards under US GAAP and the value may not be indicative of the price we would get for selling our assets in their current condition. At this time, no shares are held in street name accounts and the Trust is not subject to FINRA s specific pricing requirements set out in Rule 2340 or otherwise. As with any valuation methodology, the methodologies utilized by the Board in reaching an estimate of the value of the shares and limited partnership units are based upon a number of estimates, assumptions, judgments, or opinions that may, or may not, prove to be correct. The use of different estimates, assumptions, judgments, or opinions would likely have resulted in significantly different estimates of the value of the shares and limited partnership units. In addition, the Board s estimate of share and limited partnership unit value is not based on the book values of our real estate, as determined by GAAP, as our book value for most real estate is based on the amortized cost of the property, subject to certain adjustments.

 Cash on hand, together with cash from operations and access to the lines of credit is expected to provide sufficient capital to meet the Company s needs for at least the next 12 months, and as appropriate, we will use cash flows from operations, net proceeds from share offerings, debt proceeds, and proceeds from the disposition of real estate investments to meet long term liquidity demands. Credit Quality of Tenants We are exposed to credit risk within our tenant portfolio, which can reduce our results of operations and cash flow from operations if our tenants are unable to pay their rent. Tenants experiencing financial difficulties may become delinquent on their rent or default on their leases and, if they file for bankruptcy protection, may reject our lease in bankruptcy court, resulting in reduced cash flow. This may negatively impact net asset values and require us to incur impairment charges. Even if a default has not occurred and a tenant is continuing to make the required lease payments, we may restructure or renew leases on less favorable terms, or the tenant s credit profile may deteriorate, which could affect the value of the leased asset and could in turn require us to incur impairment charges. To mitigate credit risk on commercial properties, we have historically looked to invest in assets that we believe are critically important to our tenants operations and have attempted to diversify our portfolio by tenant, tenant industry and geography. We also monitor all of our properties performance through review of rent delinquencies as a precursor to a potential default, meetings with tenant management and review of tenants financial statements and compliance with financial covenants. When necessary, our asset management process includes restructuring transactions to meet the evolving needs of tenants, refinancing debt and selling properties, as well as protecting our rights when tenants default or enter into bankruptcy. Lease Expirations and Occupancy Our residential leases are for a term of one year or less. The Advisor, with the assistance of our property managers, actively manages our real estate portfolio and begins discussing options with tenants in advance of scheduled lease expirations. In certain cases, we may obtain lease renewals from our tenants; however, tenants may elect to move out at the end of their term. In the cases where tenants elect not to renew, we may seek replacement tenants or try to sell the property . Cash Flow Analysis Our objectives are to generate sufficient cash flow over time to provide shareholders with increasing dividends and to seek investments with potential for strong returns and capital appreciation throughout varying economic cycles. We have funded 100 of the dividends from operating cash flows. In setting a dividend rate, we focus primarily on expected returns from investments we have already made to assess the sustainability of a particular dividend rate over time.

Property-level operating expenses consist primarily of property management fees including salaries and wages of property management personnel, utilities, cleaning, repairs, insurance, security, building maintenance costs, and real estate taxes. Additionally, we incur general and administrative expenses, advisory fees, acquisition and disposition expenses, and financing fees. Net cash provided by operating activities was 34,294 and 25,900 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which consists primarily of net income from property operations adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 20,235 in dividends and distributions, redeemed 9,768 of shares and units, and made mortgage principal payments of 14,522. Net cash used in financing activities was 32,178 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid 19,686 in dividends and distributions, redeemed 4,455 of shares and units, received 41,250 from new mortgage notes payable, and made mortgage principal payments of 24,668. Dividends and Distributions Common Stock We declared cash dividends to our shareholders during the period from January 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024 totaling 9,873 or 0.8625 per share, of which 4,285 were cash dividends and 5,588 were reinvested through the dividend reinvestment plan. The cash dividends were paid from our 34,294 of cash flows from operations. We declared cash dividends to our shareholders during the period from January 1, 2023 to September 30, 2023 totaling 9,527 or 0.8625 per share, of which 3,757 were cash dividends and 5,770 were reinvested through the dividend reinvestment plan. The cash dividends were paid from our 25,900 of cash flows from operations. The Amended and Restated Dividend Reinvestment Plan, effective January 1, 2025, permits us to provide eligible shareholders with a simple and convenient way to invest dividends as well as additional cash in additional shares of the Trust s Common Shares. The Plan is intended to be used as a vehicle for long-term investment in the Trust s common shares of beneficial interest. The number of common shares of the Trust issuable under the plan is 10,000,000. The cap on the quarterly dividend reinvestments and quarterly optional cash purchases, in each case, is 25,000. The Annual cap on purchases under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan is 100,000 and provides participants the ability to exceed such cap with approval of the Trust. We continue to provide cash dividends to our shareholders from cash generated by our operations. The following chart summarizes the sources of our cash used to pay dividends. Our primary source of cash is cash flow provided by operating activities from our investments as presented in our cash flow statement. We also include distributions from unconsolidated affiliates to the extent that the underlying real estate operations in these entities generate cash flow and the gain on sale of properties relates to net profits from the sale of certain properties. Our presentation is not intended to be an alternative to our consolidated statement of cash flows and does not present all sources and uses of our cash.

 The following table presents certain information regarding our dividend coverage: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Cash flows provided by operations (net income of 14,908 and 7,456, respectively) 34,294 25,900 Distributions in excess of earnings received from unconsolidated affiliates 1,706 2,118 Proceeds from sale of real estate investments and non-real estate investments 9,863 5,082 Dividends declared (9,873) (9,527) Excess 35,990 23,573 Limited Partnership Units The Operating Partnership agreement provides that our Operating Partnership will distribute to the partners (subject to certain limitations) cash from operations on a quarterly basis (or more frequently, if we so elect) in accordance with the percentage interests of the partners. We determine the amounts of such distributions in our sole discretion. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership declared distributions totaling 16,096 to holders of limited partnership units in our Operating Partnership, which we paid on April 15; July 15; and October 15, 2024. Declared distributions are included in dividends payable on the balance sheet. Distributions were paid at a rate of 0.2875 per unit per quarter, which is equal to the per share distribution rate paid to the common shareholders. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we declared quarterly distributions totaling 16,065 to holders of limited partnership units in our Operating Partnership, which we paid on April 17; July 17; and October 16, 2023 . Distributions were paid at a rate of 0.2875 per unit per quarter, which is equal to the per share distribution rate paid to the common shareholders. Sources of Dividends and Distributions For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid aggregate dividends of 9,745, of which 4,164 were paid with cash flows provided by operating activities and 5,581 were reinvested. Our FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 36,742. Therefore, our management believes our distribution policy is sustainable over time. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid aggregate dividends of 9,428, of which 3,580 were paid with cash flows provided by operating activities and 5,848 were reinvested. Our FFO was 28,413 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For a further discussion of FFO, including a reconciliation of FFO to net income, see Funds from Operations above. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitativ e Disclosures about Market Risk The Trust is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions and principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Trust manages economic risks, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities. The principal material financial market risk to which we are exposed, is interest-rate risk, which the Trust manages through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Trust enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Trust used 15 interest rate swaps to hedge the variable cash flows associated with market interest rate risk. These swaps have an aggregated notional amount of 128,013 at September 30, 2024. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The interest rate swaps expose us to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparty under the terms of the agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the Trust had 128,013 of variable-rate borrowings, with the total outstanding balance fixed through interest rate swaps. Even though our goal is to maintain a fairly low exposure to interest rate risk, we may become vulnerable to significant fluctuations in interest rates on any future repricing or refinancing of our fixed or variable rate debt or future debt.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and interim-Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and interim-Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the third fiscal quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
