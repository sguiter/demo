 Our Business 
 
 We are a provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management HCM software solutions delivered as Software-as-a-Service SaaS for small, medium-sized and enterprise-level businesses. We offer human resources HR tools necessary to build a thriving workforce, provide the resources to stay compliant with dynamic federal, state, and local tax jurisdictions and their respective labor laws, freeing cash flows so these businesses can spend their financial capital on growing their business rather than administrative overhead that can impede growth. Our solutions also provide new ways for employers to connect with their employees in order to enhance their relationships with their talent. Asure s HCM suite Asure HCM includes Payroll Tax solutions, Recruiting, HR compliance and services, Time Attendance software and data integrations that enable employers and their employees to enhance efficiencies and take advantage of value-added solutions, which we refer to as AsureMarketplace . AsureMarketplace automates interactions between our HCM systems with third-party providers to enhance efficiency, improve accuracy and to extend the range of services offered to employers and their employees. In addition to our current Asure HCM suite, we are in the process of launching our AsurePay product which is a new innovative online banking solution which will offer debit cards, paycheck advances, and fee-free ATM withdrawal. Our approach to HR compliance services leverages technology and on-demand content to enhance scalability and efficiency while prioritizing client interactions. We offer our services directly and indirectly through our network of reseller partners. 
 
 From recruitment to retirement, our solutions help more than 100,000 businesses across the United States. Approximately 15,000 of our clients are direct and the 85,000 remaining clients are indirect, as they have contracts with reseller partners who white label our solutions. 
 
 We strive to be the most trusted HCM resource to small, medium-sized SMBs and enterprise-level businesses. We target SMBs through less densely populated U.S. metropolitan cities where fewer of our competitors have a presence and have begun expansion of certain product lines to enterprise-level businesses. Our solutions solve three primary challenges that prevent businesses from growing: HR complexity, allocation of human and financial capital, and the ability to build great teams. We sell our solutions through both direct and partner channels. We supplement our direct sales efforts with partner programs that afford us access to opportunities in various geographic and industry niches. We have two types of partners: reseller partners that white label our products while providing value-added services to their clients (or indirect clients) and referral partners that provide us with business leads but do no resell our solutions. We have and will continue to invest in research and development to expand our solutions. Our solutions reduce the administrative burden on employers and increase employee productivity while managing the employment lifecycle.

 Revenue 
 
 Revenue is comprised of recurring revenue, professional services, hardware, and other revenue. We expect our revenue to increase as we introduce new applications, expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our mix of recurring revenue, and professional services, hardware and other revenue to remain relatively constant. While revenue mix varies by product, recurring revenue represented over 97 of total revenue in nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 81 in nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our revenue was derived from the following sources (in thousands): 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Variance 2024 2023 Recurring 28,626 23,833 4,793 20 Professional services, hardware and other 678 5,501 (4,823) (88) Total 29,304 29,334 (30) 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Variance 2024 2023 Recurring 85,950 74,749 11,201 15 Professional services, hardware and other 3,050 18,069 (15,019) (83) Total 89,000 92,818 (3,818) (4) 
 
 Recurring Revenue 
 
 Recurring revenue includes fees for our payroll, payroll tax, tax management, time and labor management, recruiting, HR compliance services, AsureMarketplace and other Asure solutions as well as fees charged for form filings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports. These revenues are derived from fixed amounts charged per billing period and sometimes an additional fee per employee or transaction processed. Our billing period varies by client based on when each client pays its employees, which may be weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly. We also generate recurring revenue from our reseller partners that license our solutions. Because recurring revenue is based, in part, on fees for use of our applications and the delivery of checks and reports that are levied on a per-employee basis, our recurring revenue increases as our clients hire more employees. Recurring revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered. 
 
 Recurring revenue includes revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms, such as Form W-2 and Form 1099, and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs (such as bonuses) for our clients. Because payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year and many of our clients are subject to form filing requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act ACA ), first quarter revenues and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters. We anticipate our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to ACA form filings for so long as the ACA (or replacement legislation) includes employer reporting requirements. In addition, we often experience increased revenues during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year. We expect the seasonality of our revenue cycle to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our non-payroll applications. 
 
 This revenue line also includes interest earned on funds held for clients. Interest earned is generated from funds we collect from clients in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services. These collections from clients are typically disbursed from one to 30 days after receipt, with some funds being held for up to 120 days. We typically invest funds held for clients in money market funds, demand deposit accounts, commercial paper, fixed income securities and certificates of deposit until they are paid to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. The amount of interest we earn from the investment of client funds is also impacted by changes in interest rates. 
 
 Recurring revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 28,626, an increase of 4,793, or 20 , from 23,833 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in payroll and tax management revenue driven by clients obtained through acquisitions, as well as an increase in revenue from AsureMarketplace , and an increase in interest earned on funds held for clients.

Table of Contents 

 Recurring revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 85,950, an increase of 11,201, or 15 , from 74,749 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Recurring revenue increase is primarily due to an increase in payroll and tax management revenue driven by clients obtained through acquisitions, an increase in HR compliance revenue, an increase in revenue from AsureMarketplace , and an increase in interest earned on funds held for clients. 
 
 Professional Services, Hardware and Other Revenue 
 
 Professional services, hardware and other revenue represents implementation fees, one-time consulting projects, on-premise maintenance, hardware devices to enhance our software products as well as revenue generated for provisioning and filing for ERTC. 
 
 Professional services, hardware and other revenue decreased 4,823, or 88 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the similar period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in non-recurring ERTC revenue. 
 
 Professional services, hardware, and other revenue decreased 15,019, or 83 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the similar period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in non-recurring ERTC revenue. 
 
 ERTC revenue was originally expected to expire during 2024 and 2025; however, it is possible that the government could make changes to or revoke the program prior to its scheduled expiration. For example, in January 2024, the United States House of Representatives passed the Tax Relief for American Families Act of 2024, which set an expiration date of January 31, 2024, on additional claims for ERTC that can potentially apply retroactively. If approved by other branches of government, this will have an effect on our ERTC revenue and cash collections. Additionally, in September 2023, the IRS announced a moratorium through the end of 2023 on processing new ERTC claims due to concerns over questionable or fraudulent claims. In June 2024, the IRS posted a news release stating that the agency continues its review of previously filed claims and that it will consult with Congress before making a final decision on the future of the moratorium. The moratorium may potentially delay the processing and collections of previously filed ERTC claims. Refer to Risk Factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024, for more information about risks related to our ERTC business. 
 
 Although our total customer base is widely spread across industries, our sales are concentrated in SMBs but are expanding to enterprise-level businesses for certain product lines. While we continue to target SMBs across industries, our search for prospective customers includes both SMBs and enterprise-level customers. Geographically, we sell our products primarily in the United States. 
 
 In addition to continuing to develop our workforce solutions and release of new software updates and enhancements, we continue to actively explore other opportunities to acquire additional products or technologies to complement our current software and services.

 Consolidated gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 19,704, a decrease of 1,576, or 7 , from 21,280 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 67 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 73 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in ERTC related professional services revenue during the period.

Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 69 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 73 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in ERTC related professional services revenue during the period.

We include intangible amortization related to developed and acquired technology within cost of sales.

The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in referral fees associated with non-recurring ERTC revenue arrangements. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue remained flat at 24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in personnel expenses driven by merit increases and higher employee insurance premiums. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense in 2024 based on the performance towards the current year bonus plan, and a decrease in facilities rent expense due to some office leases terminating in 2023 and early 2024. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 32 for the same period in 2023.

Net cash used in financing activities was 21,400 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily consisted of payments of notes payable of 35,627 for the extinguishment of the structural debt and a net decrease in client fund obligations of 31,033. These usages of cash were partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock of 45,986. 
 
 We have outstanding promissory notes in connection with a business combination and multiple asset acquisitions executed between September 2021 and July 2024, all of which are immaterial individually and in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2024, these promissory notes have a total outstanding balance of 9,943, have maturities ranging from October 1, 2025, to July 1, 2029, and carry interest ranging from 2 to 5 . 
 
 Sources of Liquidity . As of September 30, 2024, the Company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately 11,248 of cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations of our business over the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 30,317. These amounts do not include cash contained within client funds. The decrease of cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to the Company s investing activities of acquisitions and software capitalization. 
 
 We cannot ensure that we can grow our cash balances or limit our cash consumption and thus maintain sufficient cash balances for our planned operations or future acquisitions; however, we do believe that we have sufficient liquidity to support our business operations for at least the next twelve months. Future business demands may lead to cash utilization at levels greater than recently experienced or expected. We may need to raise additional capital in the future in order to grow our existing software operations and to seek additional strategic acquisitions in the near future. Currently, we do not have a credit facility or access to a line of credit as of September 30, 2024 and we may leverage these potential sources of liquidity to raise additional capital for the aforementioned purposes. If we do leverage such sources, we cannot ensure that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, or at the time we need it. We also cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain financing through lending institutions when we need it or on acceptable terms.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 We have prepared our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and included the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant intercompany transactions and balances in the consolidation. Preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at fiscal year-end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal year. The more significant estimates made by management include the valuation allowance for our gross deferred tax asset, the determination of the fair value of our long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the given circumstances. These estimates could be materially different under different conditions and assumptions. Additionally, the actual amounts could differ from the estimates made. Management periodically evaluates estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements for continued reasonableness. We prospectively apply appropriate adjustments, if any, to our estimates based upon our periodic evaluation. For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Management s Discussion and Analysis in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 There have been no material changes to our exposure from market risks from those disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by Asure to the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation to conclude with reasonable assurance that Asure s disclosure controls and procedures were designed and operating effectively to report the information each company is required to disclose in the reports they file with the SEC on a timely basis. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Change in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the period ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 We have been, and in the future may be, the defendant or plaintiff in various actions arising in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, we were not party to any material legal proceedings. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Except for the risk factor set forth below, which was also included on our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024, and investors are encouraged to review these risk factors prior to making an investment in the Company. In connection with recent acquisitions the risk factor set forth below has been restated to include the acquisition of complementary businesses in addition to the acquisition of reseller partners. 
 
 We have acquired and plan to continue to acquire from time to time our Reseller Partners' businesses that have licensed our proprietary software and other complementary businesses either through stock acquisition or through an asset purchase of their client service agreements and related assets. These acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, result in unknown or unforeseen liabilities, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and ownership and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: 
 
 potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; 
 
 difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel; 
 
 diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; 
 
 the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; 
 
 potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; 
 
 potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; 
 
 inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; 
 
 inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; 
 
 difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis; 
 
 increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services; 
 
 potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses including regulatory noncompliance; 
 
 negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation; 
 
 additional stock based compensation; 
 
 the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue; 
 
 delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; 
 
 ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;

 potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets; and 
 
 the tax effects of any such acquisitions. 
 
 Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, which may affect our ability to complete acquisitions or investments. If we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, or issue equity as consideration for an acquisition, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligations related to, the incurrence of indebtedness. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 On July 11, 2024, we issued 525 shares of our common stock to an applicant tracking technology company based in South Dakota from whom we acquired certain of their assets. The shares were part of the purchase price consideration in connection with such purchase. The shares were valued at 8.09 per share, or an aggregate of 4,250. The issuance and sale of the shares of our common stock in connection with this acquisition are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D thereunder. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 
 
 None. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 
 None. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 On October 31, 2024, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC ("Roth ). The Sales Agreement provides for the offer and sale of up to 25,000 of our newly issued Common Stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Common Stock ), from time to time through an at the market offering program. We will specify the parameters for the sale of the shares of Common Stock, including the number of shares to be issued, the time period during which sales are requested to be made, any limitation on the number of shares that may be sold in any one trading day and any minimum price below which sales may not be made. We may offer and sell up to 25,000 of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. Actual sales of Common Stock under the Sales Agreement will depend on a variety of factors including, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock, and potential funding needs. As a result, the full amount of capital may not be fully realized. We intend to use the net proceeds from these at-market offerings, if any, for general corporate purposes. Our general corporate purposes include, but are not limited to, repayment or refinancing of debt, capital expenditures, funding possible acquisitions, working capital and satisfaction of other obligations.
