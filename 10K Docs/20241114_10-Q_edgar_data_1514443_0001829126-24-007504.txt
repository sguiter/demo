shares of no-par value stock held by Lawrence Garcia, President and CEO with shares, and Lillian Flores, VP of Operations with shares. AGS provides armed guard services as a federal contractor with licenses in five states and provides commercial guard services in California. 

On July 7, 2021, AGS, entered into an agreement to gain 100 control of Health Revenue Assurance Holdings, Inc HRAA a public corporation, incorporated in Nevada, by the purchase of shares of Preferred A-1 Stock from the seller, Custodian Ventures LLC. The purchase of HRAA allowed the Company to begin plans to consummate a reverse merger with HRAA, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of a public company. In March of 2022, a Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State, changing the name of HRAA to Ameriguard Security Services, Inc. AGSS ). Shortly thereafter, a stock name and ticker change report was filed with the SEC, and the stock ticker of HRAA was changed to AGSS. 

On December 9, 2022, AGS executed the reverse merger agreement and became the subsidiary of AGSS (the Company ). From that point forward, the financial statement filings will be the consolidation of Ameriguard Security Services, Inc, a Nevada company, with Ameriguard Security Services, Inc., a California company. 

On October 20, 2023, the Company executed a share purchase agreement to acquire TransportUS Inc. TransportUS, Inc. was incorporated on October 24, 2018, with an S-Corp tax election. The corporation was incorporated with the issuance of 1,000 shares with no-par par value stock held by Lawrence Garcia, President and CEO. TransportUS Inc. provides human transportation services as a federal contractor, currently providing services in the state of California. 

The Company s accounting year end is December 31. 

Basis of Presentation 

These consolidating financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The financial statements and notes include TransportUS Inc. s financial results for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. 

Risks and Uncertainties 

The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we are or may face in the future. If any of the following do occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 

The company receives over of its total revenue from five Federal contracts as described in Note 11 below. These contracts have specific terms, typically five years with the opportunity for extension, but there are no assurances they will be extended. Although we have had several extended in the past, there is no guarantee this will again happened in the future. However, there are significant direct expenses for each contract that also are removed from operations at the end of a contract. As a result, the revenue lost from a completed contract does not affect the bottom-line profits in an amount equal to the revenue lost. The actual net income impact depends on the contract. 

The process required to acquire a government contract takes several months to complete prior to delivery of the proposal to the contracting agency. Due to the time span required to prepare a proposal and winning the contract is not guaranteed, the Company maintains a department of individuals who monitor and write proposals for all government contracts that become open for bid on a continuing basis. It is important to the Company that new contracts are acquired consistently to maintain and grow annual revenue. 

Other risks to operations consist of State and Federal regulations, staffing shortages, accelerating inflation, and overall business environment issues we cannot foresee.

On December 9, 2022, we signed the definitive merger agreement initiating a reverse merger with AGSS, resulting in AGS becoming a 100 owned subsidiary of AGSS. Prior to the merger, AGS funded the operational expenses of AGSS and treated these expenses as related party expenses. These expenses were eliminated when the two companies were consolidated for the financial statement presentation.

In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, the Company notes that in addition to the description of historical facts contained herein, this report contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as detailed herein and from time to time in the Company s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and elsewhere. Such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those, described in the forward-looking statements.

Corporate Structure 

As previously mentioned, on December 9, 2022, AGSS executed a reverse merger with AmeriGuard resulting in AGSS becoming the sole owner of AmeriGuard. This merger establishes AGSS as a company operating a viable guard company with annual sales of approximately 24,000,000. On October 20, 2023, the Company executed a share purchase agreement to acquire TransportUS Inc. TransportUS, Inc. was incorporated on October 24, 2018, with an S-Corp tax election. The corporation was incorporated with the issuance of 1,000 shares with no-par par value stock held by Lawrence Garcia, President and CEO. TransportUS Inc. provides human transportation services as a federal contractor, currently providing services in the state of California. These two acquisitions within one year allows AGSS to access the capital market to generate the capital needed to continue its growth strategy of mergers and acquisitions within related industries. 

AGSS continues developing the leadership team needed for success. We have in place a CEO with 20 years of experience in our industry who has experienced success in the government contracting market. Our CFO has 20 years of experience in improving business performance as well as organizational growth across various sectors. Our Senior Controller has over 35 years of business finance experience, the last 15 of which he has been focusing on organizational development consulting across multiple industries, and an Operations team on the east coast managing IT and our federal contracts. We have an exclusive contract with Think Equity, a New York Investment Banking Firm, and we have engaged legal and SEC compliance professionals. We have a Board of Directors with Wall Street and government security experience, making us well positioned to aggressively grow the business.

Results
of Operations for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 

Revenues and Cost of Goods Sold 

At the end of the third quarter of 2024 the Company
experienced an 1.6 increase in services revenue compared to the same time period of 2023 of approximately 308,000. The increase was
the result of a federal guard contract that ended in May 2023 that provided approximately 2,200,000 in revenue through June of that
year. This revenue loss was offset by an increase in revenue of approximately 2,500,000 from federal transportation contracts through
September 2024. 

Along with the increase in revenue, AGSS experienced
an increase in the gross profit margin due to the reduction of expenses, associated with the aforementioned contract that ended in May 2023.
During 2024, AGSS has been focused on staff management of the three Federal Guard contracts currently held, to improve operation efficiencies
and reduce overtime expenses. This effort, along with the increase in transportation revenue without a significant increase in direct
expenses, has caused an increase in the gross profit margin. The results of the increase in revenue along with the reduction in direct
expenses benefited AGSS by increasing the gross profit margin percentage from 9 in 2023 to 14 as of September 30, 2024 adding approximately
 970,000 towards overhead expenses. 

Operating Expenses and Other Expense 

Operation expenses increased in 2024 over 2023
by approximately 999,000. Much of the increase, 61 , was the increase of approximately 549,000 in loan interest expense. Due to the
tightening of capital markets during the previous nine months, we have had to accept less than favorable loan terms in order to expand
our operations. We have been working diligently on finding more traditional financing to refinance our debt obligations. We anticipate
receiving loan refinancing and an influx of capital before the end of the fourth quarter 2024. 

The remaining increase of approximately 450,000
in operating expenses is from a combination of increases and decreases in various expense categories. There was an increase in professional
fees of approximately 340,000, an increase in advertising and marketing of approximately 70,000, an increase in depreciation expense
of approximately 71,000, an increase in staff training of approximately 51,000 an increase in licenses of approximately 48,000, an
increase in vehicle expense of approximately 12,000, an increase in communications expense of approximately 24,000 and an increase in
the general and administrative expense group of approximately 82,000. The 698,000 expense increase was offset by decreases of expenses
in administrative salaries of approximately 215,000, and live scan expenses of 30,000. 

At this time, we believe that our operating structure
and current level of expense can handle significantly more revenue with minor increases in our operating overhead expenses. This would
allow the entire gross profit of any new contract or company acquisition to flow directly to our earnings, providing a consistent return
on investment for our stockholders. Management is focused on reducing operating expenses wherever possible and actively seeking companies
to acquire. 

Net (Loss) from Operations 

Net loss from operations through September 2024
was approximately 1,819,000, which is a small increase over the loss during the same time period of 2023 by approximately 29,000. Separating
the 9-month loss by quarter in 2024, the first quarter loss was approximately 857,000 with the second and third quarter losses averaging
approximately 473,000 each, a 45 reduction. It is management s expectation that quarterly loss for the 4 th quarter
will be under 200,000 and in the event we are successful in being awarded some new federal contracts, we can see the quarterly loss being
eliminated by the end of 2024. 

As previously mentioned, the operational structure
that drives these costs has excess capacity in anticipation of significant growth via new contracts, or more specifically, company acquisitions.
This allows additional revenue to flow directly to our bottom-line earnings. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company s principal sources of liquidity
include cash from operations and proceeds from debt financing. During the nine months ending September 30, 2024, operations generated
a net decrease in cash of approximately 1,438,000 while cash used by investing activities was approximately 515,000. Financing activities
added approximately 685,000. The net decrease in cash for the period was approximately 1,269,000. 

On September 30, 2024, the Company had cash
on hand of 896,616 with total current assets of 3,102,833.

Moving Forward 

Following the reverse merger in December 2022,
we have been diligently at work to achieve the goals that AGSS has laid out as part of its long-term plan. As to be expected, there have
been challenges as we embark on our growth plan as a public entity. Although the costs of being a public company as well as accelerating
the company s growth, has impacted our bottom line, we believe that we are now in a position to execute our plans. Our current overhead
expense structure has the capacity to manage multiple times the revenues from one of our two strategic sources. We remain confident and
expect that our future will be profitable. As indicated above, our second and third quarter loss was 51 lower than the first quarter.
That was due to an increase in revenue from our Transportation company and a reduction in overtime costs in our guard contracts. 

Our first source of growth is to continue down
our historical path of seeking out contracts that meet our sweet spot and bidding with the expectation of successful results. In early
February 2024, TransportUS Inc was awarded a new contract from the Department of Veterans Affairs providing transportation for veterans
in central LA. In July 2024 our Transportation company was awarded a new contract from the Department of Veterans Affairs providing transportation
for veterans in Loma Linda CA. In late September we received a 6-month extension through March 2025, on our Long Beach contract with the
Department of Veterans Affairs. TransportUS Inc currently has a proposal submitted with the Department of Veterans Affairs for San Diego
California. This contract is to be awarded in the 4 th quarter, 2024. If awarded to TransportUS, this will add 5 million a
year in revenue. Ameriguard Security Services Inc continues to submit proposals for Federal contract as well. We currently have two contracts
in process and several more in process. We anticipate several contracts to be awarded in the coming months. If Ameriguard is to be awarded
one or two of the contracts we have in process, revenue increases would be between 5 and 15 million. 

Our second source of growth is mergers and acquisitions.
Now that we have access to capital markets and we operate in both the guard industry and the non-emergency medical transportation industry,
we believe that we are well-positioned for long-term growth. The total available market for the security industry continues to grow, and
at the same time, there is significant consolidation occurring. As a top-tier company in the industry, we can be a desired company for
acquisition exits and quickly triple our revenues with one or two key acquisitions. After such acquisitions, we can see the additional
gross profits from acquired companies flow directly to our earnings. Such returns may be quick and significant. 

There are also acquisition opportunities in several other industries that fit our business model. Those include cyber security, private security, ammunition manufacturing, and surveillance to mention a few. 

The Company continues the process of our first equity raise to recover our expended working capital and acquire additional companies. We anticipate the equity raise to be completed in the next quarter. 

Management is very positive regarding profitable operations for the next twelve months based on the following: 

AGSS operates in growing industries. 

The security industry continues to expand, and we are now a part of the expanding transportation industry as well 

There are over 8,000 security companies operating in our market, with 50 available for acquisition. 

Our management team, Board of Directors and supporting equity professionals can get the job done. 

We have been and will continue to be a company that is very conservative with our resources and will use every possible dollar to provide strength and good return to our investors. 

We are in it for the long haul. 

We make profits the old fashion way, hard work.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information that would be required to be disclosed in the Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange
Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to
satisfy the objectives for which they are intended due to a weakness in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below. 

The framework our management uses to evaluate
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is based on the guidance provided by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
(COSO) of the Treadway Commission in its 1992 report: INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. Based on our evaluation under the framework
described above, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of September 30,
2024, due to the same weaknesses that rendered our disclosure controls and procedures ineffective. The Company s internal control
over financial reporting is not effective due to a lack of sufficient resources to hire support staff to separate duties between different
individuals. The Company plans to address these weaknesses as resources become available by hiring additional professional staff, as funding
becomes available, outsourcing certain aspects of the recording and reporting functions, and separating responsibilities. We have identified
the following material weakness. 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not maintain
effective controls over the control environment. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii)
of Regulation S-K. Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization, management has determined that these
circumstances constitute a material weakness. 

Because of these weaknesses, management has concluded
that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the criteria
established in INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK issued by the COSO. Management believes that the weaknesses set forth
above did not have an effect on our financial results because the activity during this period was nominal. However, management believes
that the lack of a functioning audit committee results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal
controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. Management will
further recruit qualified individuals, establish an audit committee, and ensure that board members have current and pertinent financial
experience. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There were changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II Other
Information 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

To our knowledge, during the past ten years, none of our directors, executive officers, promoters, control persons, or nominees has: 

been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses) 

had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time; 

been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated; 

been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or 

been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

As of September 30, 2024, there are three
employment-related matters pending. The issues in such matters involve terminated employees alleging the Company has failed to pay minimum
wages, sick pay wages, meal period violations, rest period violations, wage statement violations, and violation of the unfair business
practices act. A lawsuit has been filed, but it is early in the process, and we cannot comment on the merits at this time. The Company
believes the suit has no merit and intends to resolve it before a trial, if possible. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no
additional litigation issues, nor changes in those in process. 

Additionally, we have had one lender file a complaint as of July 17, 2024. The lender and the Company are in settlement negotiations over the actual amount, which we believe is immaterial, which is owed as well as whether certain contract obligations were appropriately complied with. The Company intends to resolve this complaint before a trial, if possible.
