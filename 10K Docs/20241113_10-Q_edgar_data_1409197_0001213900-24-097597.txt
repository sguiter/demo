, the Company completed the
acquisition of the WonderLeaf assets for shares of common stock valued at , or per share. At the time of acquisition
WonderLeaf had no operations or no employees and was not considered a business. 

Pursuant to ASU 2017-01 and ASC 805, the Company
analyzed the business of WonderLeaf to determine if the Company acquired a business or acquired assets. Based on this analysis, the Company
determined that it acquired assets. No goodwill was recorded since the purchase was accounted for as an asset purchase. In accordance
with ASC 805, the fair value of the assets acquired is based on either the fair value of the consideration given or the fair value of
the assets acquired, whichever is more clearly evident, and thus, more reliably measurable. The Company used the market price of the
 common shares issued of as the fair value of the assets acquired since this value was more clearly evident, and thus,
more reliably measurable than the fair value of the license and fixed assets acquired. 

Company management determined if the Company
acquired a business or acquired assets. The FASB issued new guidance (ASU 2017-01) that changed the definition of a business to assist
entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. The guidance requires an entity to evaluate if
substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar
identifiable assets; if so, the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. The guidance also requires a business to
include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs by more closely aligning it with how outputs are described
in ASC 606. Under the new guidance, an entity first determines whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired
is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this threshold is met, the set is not a
business. If it s not met, the entity then evaluates whether the set meets the requirement that a business include, at a minimum,
an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Under the ASU, a set is not
a business when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a
group of similar identifiable assets. 

Pursuant to 805-10-55-83, the Company first considered
the guidance in paragraphs 805-10-55-5A through 55-5C. The identifiable assets that could be recognized in the purchase only included
the license and fixed assets. Accordingly, the transaction was not considered a business. 

The monetary value of the shares is deemed
by the Company to be in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805-50-30 Business Combinations ,
the Company determined that if the consideration paid is not in the form of cash, the measurement may be based on either (i) the cost
which is measured based on the fair value of the consideration given or (ii) the fair value of the assets (or net assets) acquired, whichever
is more clearly evident and thus more reliably measurable. No goodwill should be recorded since the WPA was accounting for as an asset
purchase. The Company determined that the fair value of the common shares issued was a better indicator which is more reliably measurable. 

The Company assigned a value of to the
licenses and to the fixed assets acquired.

should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto which are included in this report. 

Overview 

Through
our wholly-owned subsidiary, Bespoke Extracts Colorado, LLC, we operate a marijuana infused products manufacturing facility in Colorado. 

In
November 2021, new management of the Company was appointed and the Company began to focus on other complimentary lines of business to
its CBD offerings. Under our new management team, we plan to expand the Company s focus to regulated cannabis markets in the United
States. 

On
December 2, 2021, Bespoke Extracts Colorado, LLC, a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into an asset purchase
agreement with WonderLeaf, and on December 7, 2021, Bespoke Colorado and WonderLeaf entered into an amendment to such asset purchase
agreement (as amended, the WonderLeaf Purchase Agreement ). Pursuant to the Wonderleaf Purchase Agreement, Bespoke Colorado
agreed to purchase from WonderLeaf, and WonderLeaf agreed to sell to Bespoke Colorado, certain assets of WonderLeaf, including a license
to manufacture marijuana-infused products, existing inventory, and extraction equipment and ancillary items, all as further set forth
in the WonderLeaf Purchase Agreement, for a purchase price of 50,000, to be paid in shares of common stock of the Company. The Company
issued a total of 222,223 shares of common stock 0.225 per share), the fair market value on the date of issuance.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 21,445. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was
 153,662. Our current liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were 1,727,778 and consisted of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of
 1,446,989, current portion of lease liability of 73,523, note payable of 25,000, secured notes payable of 120,394 and advances payable
related party of 61,872. As of September 30, 2023, we had cash deficit of 2,949. Net cash used in operating activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 398,379. Our current liabilities as of September 30, 2023 were 925,281 and consisted of accounts
payable and accrued liabilities of 828,069, and current portion of lease liability of 64,330 and notes payable related party of 26,997. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 the Company borrowed an additional 8,500 from a related party, 25,000 note payable and secured notes payable
of 135,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the Company borrowed an additional 26,997 from a related party and repaid
 90,000 owed for an inventory earnout in addition the Company borrowed an additional 434,000 in a Note payable from a related party. 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared assuming a continuation of the Company
as a going concern. The Company had negative cash flows from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended
December 31, 2023 and had a working capital deficit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. This raises substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Our primary source of capital has been from the sale of equity and
convertible debt securities. Our primary use of capital has been for professional fees and selling, general and administrative costs.
We have no committed sources of capital and will need to raise additional capital to continue and expand our operations. Additional capital
may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

In
addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations, including by limiting access to our facilities, customers, management,
and professional advisors, and by causing delays and constraints in manufacturing and shipping of our products. These factors, in turn,
may negatively impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our products, and our ability to raise capital on acceptable
terms, or at all. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no significant off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

18 

Critical accounting policies and estimates 

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported
periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances.
We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding
our results, which are described below and in Note 1 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 

Accounts Receivable 

Accounts receivable are recorded at fair value on the date revenue is recognized. The Company provides provision for credit losses resulting
from the inability of its customers to repay their obligation. If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate,
resulting in an impairment of their ability to repay, additional allowances may be required. The Company provides for potential uncollectible
accounts receivable based on specific customer identification and historical collection experience adjusted for existing market conditions.
If market conditions decline, actual collection experience may not meet expectations and may result in decreased cash flows and increased
bad debt expense. 

Inventory 

Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out basis and net realizable value. Net realizable
value is defined as sales price less cost of completion, disposition and transportation and a normal profit margin. 

Income Taxes 

We utilize the asset and
liability method of accounting for income taxes. We recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred
tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. We consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies
in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable. We have
recorded and continue to carry a full valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets that will not reverse against deferred
tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period. If we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that we will realize
all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will adjust our valuation allowance in the period we make the determination. We expect
to provide a full valuation allowance on our future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our
ability to realize these assets. 

Stock Based Compensation 

Stock options and warrants
issued to consultants and other non-employees as compensation for services provided to the Company are accounted for based on the fair
value of the services provided or the estimated fair market value of the option or warrant, whichever is more reliably measurable, and
in accordance FASB ASC 718 , Compensation-Stock Compensation, including related amendments and interpretations. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not required for smaller
reporting companies.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management of the Company
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of
the period covered by this report. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based on this evaluation,
our management has concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective since the following
material weaknesses exist: 

Our
chief executive officer also functions as our principal financial officer. As a result, our officer may not be able to identify
errors and irregularities in the financial statements and reports; 

We
were unable to maintain full segregation of duties within our financial operations due to our reliance on limited personnel in the finance
function. While this control deficiency did not result in any audit adjustments to our financial statements, it could have resulted
in a material misstatement that might have been prevented or detected by a segregation of duties; and 

Documentation
of all proper accounting procedures is not yet complete. 

To the extent reasonably
possible given our limited resources, we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned weaknesses, including, but not limited to,
increasing the capacity of our qualified financial personnel to ensure that accounting policies and procedures are consistent across
the organization and that we have adequate control over financial statement disclosures. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
