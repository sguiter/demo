As of September 28, 2024, we had of borrowings outstanding net of deferred financing costs on the Existing Term Loan Facility, of borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility, and cash of . Subsequent to September 28, 2024, the Company drew down an additional under our Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with preparing the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024, management evaluated its future liquidity and forecasted operating results for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements and determined that, in light of the foregoing conditions, substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern exists, absent consummating a transaction to provide additional liquidity or modifications to the Company s existing Credit Facilities. 
 When conditions and events, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, management evaluates the mitigating effect of its plans to determine if it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within the assessment period and, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions and events to alleviate substantial doubt. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company initiated a formal review process to evaluate strategic alternatives to maximize the potential of the business and returns for stakeholders. On October 15, 2024, we announced a strategic partnership with Beyond, Inc. Beyond with the intention of positioning the Company to achieve incremental sales growth over time by utilizing and benefiting from Beyond s intellectual property, customer data, network of brands, and affiliate relationships. As part of the terms of the collaboration, Beyond has agreed to invest in the Company through a preferred equity transaction subject to certain terms and conditions, including an amendment or refinancing of the Company s Credit Facilities in a manner commercially acceptable to Beyond (the Equity Investment ). See Note 10 for additional information regarding the Equity Investment. 
 To mitigate the substantial doubt, the Company is actively working with its lenders to amend or refinance the Credit Facilities and facilitate consummation of the Equity Investment. However, as the ability to amend or refinance the Credit Facilities and consummate the Equity Investment is outside of management s control, the Company cannot conclude that

 Seasonality 
 Our unique offering of organizing solutions, custom spaces, and in-home services makes us less susceptible to holiday season shopping patterns than many retailers. Our quarterly results fluctuate, depending upon a variety of factors, including our product offerings, promotional events, store openings, the weather, remodeling or relocations, shifts in the timing of holidays, timing of delivery of orders, competitive factors and general economic conditions, including economic downturns as a result of unforeseen events such as pandemics, inflation, and supply chain disruptions, among other things. Accordingly, our results of operations may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis, relative to corresponding periods in prior years. In addition, we may take certain pricing or marketing actions that could have a disproportionate effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in a particular quarter or selling season.

 reportable segments consist of TCS and Elfa. The TCS segment includes the Company s retail stores, website and call center, as well as in-home services. We operate the C Studio manufacturing facility in Elmhurst, Illinois, which designs and manufactures the Company s premium wood-based custom space product offering. We determined that TCS and C Studio have similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria set forth in ASC 280, Segment Reporting. Therefore, we have combined these operating segments into the TCS reportable segment. 
 The Elfa segment includes the manufacturing business that produces elfa brand products that are sold domestically exclusively through the TCS segment, as well as on a wholesale basis in approximately countries around the world, with a concentration in the Nordic region of Europe. The intersegment sales in the Elfa column represent elfa product sales to the TCS segment. These sales and the related gross margin on merchandise recorded in TCS inventory balances at the end of the period are eliminated for consolidation purposes in the Eliminations column. The net sales to third parties in the Elfa column represent sales to customers outside of the United States. 
 The Company has determined that adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization Adjusted EBITDA is the profit or loss measure that the CODM uses to make resource allocation decisions and evaluate segment performance. Adjusted EBITDA assists management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations and, therefore, are not included in measuring segment performance. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated in accordance with the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility (as both terms are defined in

 The Purchase Agreement contains termination rights for the Company and Beyond, including, among others, by either the Company or Beyond if the Closing does not occur before January 31, 2025 by reason of the failure of any of the applicable closing conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement to be satisfied. 
 Rights Agreement 
 On October 8, 2024, the Company entered into a Rights Agreement between the Company and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC as Rights Agent (as amended from time to time, the "Rights Agreement") that was previously approved by the Board. 
 In connection with the Rights Agreement, the Board approved and declared a dividend distribution of preferred stock purchase right (each, a "Right") for each share of Common Stock of the Company outstanding at the close of business on October 23, 2024. Each Right will entitle the registered holder thereof, after the Rights become exercisable and until October 7, 2025 (or the earlier redemption, exchange, or termination of the Rights), to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value per share (the Series A Preferred ), of the Company at a price of per one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred. The complete terms of the Rights are set out in a Rights Agreement, dated October 8, 2024, between the Company and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC as rights agent. The Rights are designed to assure that all of the Company s stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the Company and to guard against partial tender offers, open market accumulations and other abusive or coercive tactics to gain control of the Company without paying all stockholders a control premium.

 On October 15, 2024, the parties entered into an Amendment to the Rights Agreement, which provides that none of Beyond or its Permitted Transferees (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) will be deemed an Acquiring Person for the purpose of the Rights Agreement.

 including an amendment or refinancing of the Company s Credit Facilities in a manner commercially acceptable to Beyond (the Equity Investment ). See Note 10 for additional information regarding the Equity Investment. 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 On May 8, 2024, the Company was notified by the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") that it was not in compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of the Company s common stock was less than 1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. 
 On August 28, 2024, the Company held its annual meeting of stockholders (the 2024 Annual Meeting at which the Company stockholders approved a proposal to amend the Company Charter to effect a reverse stock split of the Common Stock at a ratio ranging from any whole number between 1-for-10 and 1-for-15 (the Reverse Stock Split Approval ), as determined by the Company Board of Directors Board ). Following receipt of the Reverse Stock Split Approval at the 2024 Annual Meeting, on September 3, 2024, the Company Board approved a 1-for-15 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split and filed a certificate of amendment to the Company Charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the Reverse Stock Split. On September 4, 2024, the Common Stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis under the existing symbol TCS and new CUSIP number 210751 202. All share and per share information reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split. 
 Under the NYSE s rules, the price condition is deemed cured if the price promptly exceeds 1.00 per share, and the price remains above that level for at least the following 30 trading days. On October 1, 2024, we were notified by the NYSE that the average closing price of our Common Stock exceeded 1.00 per share for at least 30 trading days. Accordingly, as of the end of September 30, 2024, the minimum price condition was deemed cured and the Company is in compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. However, there is also no assurance that the Company will maintain compliance with this or the other listing standards of the NYSE. 
 Rights Agreement 
 On October 8, 2024, the Company entered into a Rights Agreement between the Company and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC as Rights Agent (as amended from time to time, the "Rights Agreement") that was previously approved by the Board. See Note 10 for additional information.

 (1) Comparable store sales includes all net sales from our TCS segment, except for (i) sales from stores open less than sixteen months, (ii) stores that have been closed permanently, (iii) stores that have been closed temporarily for more than seven days and (iv) C Studio sales to third parties. A store is included in the comparable store sales calculation on the first day of the sixteenth full fiscal month following the store s opening. When a store is relocated, we continue to consider sales from that store to be comparable store sales. A store permanently closed is not considered comparable in the fiscal month that it closes. A store temporarily closed for more than seven days is not considered comparable in the fiscal month it is closed. The store then becomes comparable on the first day of the following fiscal month in which it reopens. 
 (2) We have presented Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net (loss) income, and adjusted (loss) income per common share diluted as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and they should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. These non-GAAP measures are key metrics used by management, our Board of Directors, and LGP to assess our financial performance. We present these non-GAAP measures because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance and because we believe it is useful for investors to see the measures that management uses to evaluate the Company. These non-GAAP measures are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. In evaluating 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using non-GAAP measures supplementally. Our non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. For more information regarding our use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net loss, see How we assess the performance of our business above and Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. For more information regarding our use of adjusted net (loss) income and adjusted net (loss) income per common share diluted, and a reconciliation of adjusted net (loss) income and adjusted net (loss) income per common share diluted to the GAAP financial measures of net loss and diluted net loss per common share, see How we assess the performance of our business above and Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.

 Thirteen Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net sales 
 The following table summarizes our net sales for each of the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023: 
 September 28, 2024 total September 30, 2023 total TCS net sales 186,815 95.0 208,525 94.9 Elfa third-party net sales 9,760 5.0 11,206 5.1 Net sales 196,575 100.0 219,731 100.0 
 Net sales in the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 decreased 23,156, or 10.5 compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was comprised of the following components: 
 Net sales Net sales for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 
 219,731 Incremental net sales (decrease) increase due to: Comparable store sales (including a 3,722, or 13.7 , decrease in online sales) 
 (26,009) Non-comparable sales 4,299 Elfa third-party net sales (excluding impact of foreign currency translation) (1,819) Impact of foreign currency translation on Elfa third-party net sales 373 Net sales for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 
 196,575 
 TCS net sales decreased 21,710 or 10.4 . Comparable store sales decreased 26,009 or 12.5 , led by general merchandise categories down 18.7 , negatively impacting comparable store sales by 1,200 basis points, combined with a 1.5 decrease for Custom Spaces, negatively impacting comparable store sales by 50 basis points. Non-comparable sales were 4,299 during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024. Elfa third-party net sales decreased 1,446 or 12.9 in the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024. After converting Elfa s third-party net sales from Swedish krona to U.S. dollars using the prior year s conversion rate for both the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, Elfa third-party net sales decreased 1,819 or 16.2 , primarily due to a decline in sales in Nordic markets. 
 Gross profit and gross margin 
 Gross profit in the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 decreased 17,629, or 13.9 , compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of decreased consolidated sales, combined with a decrease in consolidated gross margin. The following table summarizes gross margin for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 by segment and consolidated. The segment gross margins include the impact of intersegment net sales from the Elfa segment to the TCS segment: 
 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 TCS gross margin 54.3 56.9 Elfa gross margin 33.7 31.2 Consolidated gross margin 55.5 57.6 
 TCS gross margin decreased 260 basis points primarily due to increased promotional activity and unfavorable product and services mix, partially offset by lower freight costs in the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024. Elfa gross margin increased 250 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 primarily due to price increases to customers. On a consolidated basis, gross margin decreased 210 basis points primarily due to the decrease in TCS segment gross margin during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses in the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 decreased 4,056, or 3.7 , compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The following table summarizes SG A as a percentage of consolidated net sales for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023: 
 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 of Net sales of Net sales TCS selling, general and administrative 50.8 47.3 Elfa selling, general and administrative 2.7 2.4 Consolidated selling, general and administrative 53.5 49.7 
 Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased 380 basis points, primarily due to deleverage of fixed costs on lower sales and increased marketing spend in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Long-lived asset impairment charges 
 A non-cash long-lived asset impairment charge of 3,390 was recorded in the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 related to one underperforming store and a planned store closure in fiscal 2024. We did not record long-lived asset impairment charges in the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023.

The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the impact of discrete items on a pre-tax loss in the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Twenty-Six Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 compared to Twenty-Six Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net sales 
 The following table summarizes our net sales for each of the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

Table of Contents 

 Net sales in the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 decreased 48,407, or 11.3 compared to the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was comprised of the following components: 
 Net sales Net sales for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023 
 426,843 Incremental net sales (decrease) increase due to: Comparable store sales (including a 10,952, or 19.8 , decrease in online sales) 
 (52,553) Non-comparable sales 7,228 Elfa third-party net sales (excluding impact of foreign currency translation) (3,301) Impact of foreign currency translation on Elfa third-party net sales 219 Net sales for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 
 378,436 
 TCS net sales decreased 45,325 or 11.2 . Comparable store sales decreased 52,553 or 13.1 , driven by general merchandise categories down 20.2 , negatively impacting comparable store sales by 1,310 basis points. Custom Spaces were flat year over year on a comparable store sales basis. Non-comparable sales were 7,228 during the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024. Elfa third-party net sales decreased 3,082 or 13.3 in the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024. After converting Elfa s third-party net sales from Swedish krona to U.S. dollars using the prior year s conversion rate for both the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 and the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023, Elfa third-party net sales decreased 3,301 or 14.2 , primarily due to a decline in sales in Nordic markets. 
 Gross profit and gross margin 
 Gross profit in the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 decreased 26,083, or 10.8 , compared to the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of decreased consolidated sales, partially offset by an increase in consolidated gross margin. The following table summarizes gross margin for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 by segment and consolidated. The segment gross margins include the impact of intersegment net sales from the Elfa segment to the TCS segment: 
 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 TCS gross margin 56.0 55.7 Elfa gross margin 35.4 31.8 Consolidated gross margin 56.8 56.5 
 TCS gross margin increased 30 basis points primarily due to lower freight costs, partially offset by increased promotional activity in the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024. Elfa gross margin increased 360 basis points primarily due to price increases to customers. On a consolidated basis, gross margin increased 30 basis points primarily due to the increase in TCS segment gross margin during the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses in the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 decreased 10,086, or 4.6 , compared to the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. The following table summarizes SG A as a percentage of consolidated net sales for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023: 
 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 of Net sales of Net sales TCS selling, general and administrative 52.6 49.1 Elfa selling, general and administrative 3.0 2.6 Consolidated selling, general and administrative 55.6 51.7 
 Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased 390 basis points, primarily due to deleverage of fixed costs on lower sales and increased marketing spend in the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023.

 Long-lived asset impairment charges 
 A non-cash long-lived asset impairment charge of 4,291 was recorded in the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 related to one underperforming store and two store closures in fiscal 2024. We did not record long-lived asset impairment charges in the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other expenses 
 Consolidated other expenses increased 2,714 or 110.3 , to 5,174, in the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 as compared to 2,460 in the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. Other expenses in the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 consist primarily of legal and professional fees related to our review of strategic alternatives, as well as employee retention costs incurred. Other expenses in the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023 consist primarily of severance costs associated with the elimination of certain positions in the prior year. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased by 1,307 or 12.8 , to 11,512, in twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 as compared to 10,205 in the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and a higher interest rate on the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. 
 Taxes 
 The benefit for income taxes in the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 was 8,894 as compared to a benefit of 2,995 in the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 was 22.4 , as compared to 7.8 in the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the impact of discrete items on a pre-tax loss in the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have relied on cash flows from operations, a 100,000 asset-based revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility as further discussed under Revolving Credit Facility below and, together with the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, the "Credit Facilities"), and the 2019 Elfa Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below) as our primary sources of liquidity. 
 Our primary cash needs are for merchandise inventories and direct materials, payroll, debt service payments, store leases, capital expenditures associated with opening new stores and updating existing stores, as well as information technology and infrastructure, including our distribution centers, and manufacturing facility enhancements. The most significant components of our operating assets and liabilities are merchandise inventories, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, operating lease assets and other assets, accounts payable, operating lease liabilities, other current and noncurrent liabilities, taxes receivable and taxes payable. Our liquidity fluctuates as a result of our building inventory for key selling periods, and as a result, our borrowings are generally higher during these periods when compared to the rest of our fiscal year. Our borrowings generally increase in our second and third fiscal quarters as we prepare for our promotional campaigns and the holiday season. In fiscal 2024, we expect total capital expenditures to be in the range of 20,000 to 25,000 primarily related to new store openings or relocations, as well as additional investments in technology and manufacturing infrastructure. The Company opened one new store and closed one store during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company is on track to open two new build-to-suit stores and close one store during the remainder of fiscal 2024. 
 The persistently challenging retail environment, including reduced consumer spending in the storage and organization category and increased price sensitivity, has significantly impacted the Company s performance. Additionally, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the review of strategic alternatives and refinancing our existing Credit Facilities. In connection with preparing the unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we evaluated our future liquidity and forecasted operating results for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that, in light of the foregoing conditions, there is substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, absent consummating a transaction to provide additional liquidity or modifications to our existing Credit Facilities. To mitigate the substantial doubt, the Company is actively working with its lenders to amend or refinance the Credit Facilities and facilitate consummation of the Equity Investment with Beyond. Additionally, the Purchase Agreement with Beyond contains restrictions on our ability to issue equity interests or incur indebtedness for borrowed money, in each case, outside the ordinary course of business between the signing date and the closing date of the 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 transaction, without Beyond s consent. Similarly, the Amendment further restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness or engage in certain non-ordinary course transactions. See Note 1 and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for additional information. 
 On August 1, 2022, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to 30,000 of our common stock. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases to be determined at our discretion, depending on market conditions and corporate needs. Open market repurchases will be structured to occur in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including within the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our shares under this authorization. This program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at the discretion of our board of directors. We expect to fund repurchases with existing cash on hand. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024. As of September 28, 2024, 25,000 remains available to repurchase common stock under the share repurchase program. However, any repurchases under the program would require the written consent of Beyond pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. 
 At September 28, 2024, we had 66,123 of cash, of which 13,968 was held by our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we had 19,557 of additional availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and approximately 10,845 of additional availability under the 2019 Elfa Revolving Facilities (as defined below) as of September 28, 2024. There were 10,428 in letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and other contracts at that date. Subsequent to September 28, 2024, the Company drew down an additional 9,000 under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Cash flow analysis 
 A summary of our key components and measures of liquidity is shown in the following table: 
 Twenty-Six Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 4,702 20,691 Net cash used in investing activities (14,504) (21,741) Net cash provided by financing activities 54,379 4,356 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 546 (69) Net increase in cash 45,123 3,237 Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) (1) 
 (10,568) (1,346) 
 ________________________________________________ 
 (1) See below for a discussion of this non-GAAP financial measure and reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 Cash from operating activities consists primarily of net loss adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and deferred taxes as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 4,702 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 and was comprised of a net loss of 30,838, partially offset by non-cash items of 18,756 and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 16,784 primarily driven by increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and inventory, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts receivable. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 20,691 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023 and was comprised of a net loss of 35,490, partially offset by non-cash items of 42,167 primarily due to the non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, as well as a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 14,014 primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of receipts and payments.

Table of Contents 

 Net cash used in investing activities 
 Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for new store openings, existing store remodels and maintenance, infrastructure, information systems, and our distribution centers, and investments and proceeds in the Company s non-qualified retirement plan trust. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 14,504 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024. Our total capital expenditures for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 were 15,270. We incurred capital expenditures of 7,041 for technology investments and 5,893 for investments in our stores. The remaining capital expenditures of 2,336 were related to maintenance capital in manufacturing facilities and distribution centers. In addition, we had net investments of 714 in the non-qualified retirement plan trust and 52 in proceeds on sales of assets. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 21,741 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. Our total capital expenditures for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023 were 22,037. We incurred capital expenditures of 11,100 for investments in our stores. We incurred capital expenditures of 8,233 for technology investments. The remaining capital expenditures of 2,704 were related to maintenance capital in manufacturing facilities and distribution centers. In addition, we had net investments of 295 in the non-qualified retirement plan trust. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities 
 Financing activities consist primarily of borrowings and payments under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the 2019 Elfa Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 54,379 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024. This included borrowings of 55,000 on the Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by repayments of 591 on indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and the 2019 Elfa Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, and payments of 30 in connection with the withholding of shares upon vesting of restricted stock awards. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 4,356 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. This included net borrowings of 5,000 on the Revolving Credit Facility and net borrowings of 528 on the 2019 Elfa Senior Secured Credit Facilities, partially offset by repayments of 1,032 on indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and the 2019 Elfa Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, and payments of 140 in connection with the withholding of shares upon vesting of restricted stock awards. 
 Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) 
 The Company presents free cash flow, which the Company defines as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period, because it believes it is a useful indicator of the Company s overall liquidity, as the amount of free cash flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment, investment, and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses. Accordingly, we believe that free cash flow provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our liquidity in the same manner as management. Our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not solely represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow. As a result, the method used by our management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. 
 Our free cash flow fluctuates as a result of seasonality of net sales, building inventory for key selling periods, and timing of investments in new store openings, existing store remodels and maintenance, infrastructure, information systems, and our distribution centers, among other things. Historically, our free cash flow has been lower in the first half of the fiscal year, due to lower net sales, operating income, and cash flows from operations, and as such, is not necessarily indicative of the free cash flow for the full year. We generated negative free cash flow of 10,568 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to negative free cash flow of 1,346 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash used in operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow: 
 Twenty-Six Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 4,702 20,691 Less: Additions to property and equipment (15,270) (22,037) Free cash flow (10,568) (1,346) 
 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility 
 On April 6, 2012, the Company, The Container Store, Inc. and certain of our domestic subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the lenders party thereto (as amended, the "Senior Secured Term Loan Facility" and as amended to the date immediately prior to the Amendment (as defined below), the Existing Term Loan Facility ). On October 8, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 9 (the Amendment to the Existing Term Loan Facility. The Amendment amends the Existing Term Loan Facility to, among other things: (i) waive the testing of the consolidated leverage ratio covenant for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, (ii) add a covenant for the Company to enter into a qualified financing transaction, and (iii) amends certain of the covenants in the Existing Term Loan Facility, which, among other things, further restrict the Company and its Subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness or engage in certain non-ordinary course transactions. The Company is required to make quarterly amortization payments of 500 on the Existing Term Loan Facility, with the remaining balance due on January 31, 2026. Prior to the date of delivery of a compliance certificate for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, the applicable interest rate margin for term benchmark loans was 4.75 , subject to a floor of 1.00 , and 3.75 for base rate loans and, thereafter, may step up to 5.00 for term benchmark loans and 4.00 for base rate loans unless the consolidated leverage ratio achieved is less than or equal to 2.75 to 1.00. As of September 28, 2024, the aggregate principal amount in outstanding borrowings under the Existing Term Loan Facility was 160,321 net of deferred financing costs. 
 The Senior Secured Term Loan Facility is secured by (a) a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets (other than the collateral that secures the Revolving Credit Facility described below on a first-priority basis and subject to certain other exceptions) and (b) a second priority security interest in the assets securing the Revolving Credit Facility described below on a first-priority basis. Obligations under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by the Company and certain of The Container Store, Inc. s U.S. subsidiaries. 
 The Senior Secured Term Loan Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur additional liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve ourselves, engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. In addition, the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility contains certain cross-default provisions and requires certain mandatory prepayments of the loans thereunder upon the occurrence of specific events, including an Excess Cash Flow (as such term is defined in the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility) requirement. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On April 6, 2012, the Company, The Container Store, Inc. and certain of our domestic subsidiaries entered into an asset-based revolving credit agreement with the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as syndication agent (as amended to date, the Revolving Credit Facility ). The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of (a) November 25, 2025 and (b) October 31, 2025 if any portion of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility remains outstanding on such date and the maturity date of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility is not extended. 
 The aggregate principal amount of the facility is 100,000. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest at Adjusted Term SOFR +1.25 . In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility includes an uncommitted incremental revolving facility in the amount of 50,000, which is subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of specified conditions. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility provides that proceeds are to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, and allows for swing line advances of up to 15,000 and the issuance of letters of credit of up to 40,000. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 The availability of credit at any given time under the Revolving Credit Facility is limited by reference to a borrowing base formula based upon numerous factors, including the value of eligible inventory, eligible accounts receivable, and reserves established by the administrative agent. As a result of the borrowing base formula, the actual borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility could be less than the stated amount of the Revolving Credit Facility (as reduced by the actual borrowings and outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility). 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by (a) a first-priority security interest in substantially all of our personal property, consisting of inventory, accounts receivable, cash, deposit accounts, and other general intangibles, and (b) a second-priority security interest in the collateral that secures the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility on a first-priority basis, as described above (subject to certain other exceptions). Obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and certain of The Container Store, Inc. s U.S. subsidiaries. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur additional liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve ourselves, engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. In addition, the financing agreements contain certain cross-default provisions. We are required to maintain a consolidated fixed-charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 if excess availability is less than 10,000 at any time. As of September 28, 2024, we had a total of 19,557 of unused borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and 71,000 borrowings outstanding and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility and no Event of Default (as such term is defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) had occurred. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we had a total of 80,000 borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 2019 Elfa Senior Secured Credit Facilities 
 On April 1, 2014, Elfa entered into a master credit agreement with Nordea Bank AbpAB, filial i Sverige, which consisted of a term loan facility (the 2014 Elfa Term Loan Facility and a revolving credit facility (the 2014 Elfa Revolving Credit Facility, and together with the 2014 Elfa Term Loan Facility, the 2014 Elfa Facilities ). On March 18, 2019, Elfa refinanced its master credit agreement with Nordea Bank AB entered into on April 1, 2014 and the senior secured credit facilities thereunder, and entered into a new master credit agreement with Nordea Bank Abp, filial i Sverige Nordea Bank ), which consists of (i) an SEK 110.0 million (approximately 10,845, as of September 28, 2024) revolving credit facility (the 2019 Original Revolving Facility ), (ii) upon Elfa s request, an additional SEK 115.0 million (approximately 11,338 as of September 28, 2024) revolving credit facility (the 2019 Additional Revolving Facility and together with the 2019 Original Revolving Facility, the 2019 Elfa Revolving Facilities ), and (iii) an uncommitted term loan facility in the amount of SEK 25.0 million (approximately 2,465 as of September 28, 2024), which is subject to receipt of Nordea Bank s commitment and satisfaction of specified conditions (the Incremental Term Facility", together with the 2019 Elfa Revolving Facilities, the "2019 Elfa Senior Secured Credit Facilities"). The term for the 2019 Elfa Senior Secured Credit Facilities began on April 1, 2019 and, pursuant to an amendment entered into in April 2023, matures on March 31, 2025. Loans borrowed under the 2019 Elfa Revolving Facilities bear interest at Nordea Bank s base rate +1.40 . Any loan borrowed under the Incremental Term Facility would bear interest at the Stockholm Interbank Offered Rate (Stibor) +1.70 . 
 The 2019 Elfa Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured by the majority of assets of Elfa. The 2019 Elfa Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict Elfa s ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional liens, sell or dispose of assets, merge with other companies, engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business and make guarantees.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 28, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Beyond entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ), pursuant to which we have agreed, among other things, to issue and sell to Beyond approximately 40,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of 40.0 million (the Equity Investment ). The Purchase Agreement contains customary covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to issue equity interests or incur indebtedness for borrowed money, in each case, outside the ordinary course of business between the signing date and the closing date of the transaction without the prior written consent of Beyond (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, delayed or denied). The inability to issue equity interests or incur indebtedness outside the ordinary course of business (or any delay in respect thereof) may restrict us from raising additional capital to fund our operations and capital expenditures during this period, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition. 
 As noted, the completion of the Equity Investment is subject to a number of conditions, including the Company refinancing or amending its existing secured credit facilities in a manner that is commercially acceptable to Beyond. The Purchase Agreement also contains termination rights for the parties, including, among others, by us or Beyond if the closing does not occur before January 31, 2025 by reason of the failure of any of the applicable closing conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement to be satisfied. 
 The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the Equity Investment for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the Equity Investment will be satisfied or waived or that the Equity Investment will be completed. 
 If the Equity Investment is not completed, we would be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Equity Investment, will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 
 the trading price of our common stock could decline; 
 if the Purchase Agreement is terminated and our Board seeks another strategic transaction, we may not be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that Beyond has agreed to in the Purchase Agreement 
 time and resources, financial and otherwise, committed by our management to matters relating to the Equity Investment could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other strategic alternatives. The Purchase Agreement also contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the Equity Investment, including that during the period between signing and closing the Equity Investment, the Company is prohibited from initiating, soliciting or encouraging change of control proposals from other third parties. This could discourage a third party from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal 
 failure to receive the Equity Investment consideration could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition; and

 we may experience negative reactions from customers, vendors, lenders and employees. 
 In addition, we could be subject to litigation related to the Equity Investment and/or face delays in the completion of the Equity Investment. These events could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs or other negative effects associated with delay and uncertainty about completion of the Equity Investment and could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. 
 We will incur significant expenses in connection with the Equity Investment, regardless of whether the Equity Investment is completed. 
 We expect to incur significant expenses related to the Equity Investment. These expenses include, but are not limited to, financial advisory fees and expenses, legal fees, accounting fees and expenses, certain employee expenses, filing fees, printing expenses and other related fees and expenses. Many of these expenses will be payable by us regardless of whether the Equity Investment is completed. 
 We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the Equity Investment and related Collaboration Agreement. 
 We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from the Equity Investment. In connection with the Equity Investment, on October 15, 2024, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Beyond (the Collaboration Agreement under which we and Beyond have agreed to work together to identify, evaluate and prioritize collaboration opportunities that are mutually beneficial to our respective business including, among other things, leveraging each other business, reducing customer acquisition costs and capturing benefits of scale by sharing resources. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Collaboration Agreement is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including our ability to effectively implement the collaboration and achieve these mutual benefits. In addition, if the Purchase Agreement with Beyond is terminated prior to closing of the Equity Investment, the Collaboration Agreement will automatically terminate and we would not realize its benefits. 
 We may also face new challenges due to operating in collaboration with Beyond, including, among others: 
 developing an effective working relationship with Beyond; 
 maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees and 
 retaining existing business and operational relationships, including with vendors and other third parties, employees and other counterparties. 
 Our stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock 
 On October 15, 2024, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Beyond, agreeing to issue and sell to Beyond approximately 40 million in aggregate liquidation preference of newly issued shares of our series B convertible preferred stock, which we refer to as our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. When issued, the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will initially be convertible into up to approximately 3.8 million shares of common stock, based on an initial conversion price of 17.25 per share of our common stock, subject to further adjustments in certain circumstances, including certain issuances of common stock or equity-linked securities by us at a sale or effective price that is less than the conversion price of the convertible preferred stock. In addition, dividends will accumulate on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock at a rate of 10 per annum (subject to increase as described further below) and will be payable quarterly in kind by their addition to the liquidation preference of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. These in kind payments will increase the potential number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. 
 The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will be convertible into shares of common stock, at the option of the holder thereof. In addition the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert, subject to certain conditions, if we amend the maturity date of our Senior Secured Term Loan to a date no earlier than January 31, 2028 or if a change of control occurs and we elect to cause the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to convert. The conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will cause our stockholders to experience dilution in their ownership percentage of common stock. Until we obtain stockholder approval under certain NYSE Listing Standards relating to the voting and conversion rights of the convertible preferred stock, which we refer to as the requisite stockholder approval, the voting and conversion rights of the convertible preferred stock will be limited to comply with those listing standards.

Table of Contents 

 Holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will have certain voting and other rights that may adversely affect holders of our common stock, and the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may have different interests from and vote their shares in a manner deemed adverse to, holders of our common stock. 
 The holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of our common stock on all matters brought before the holders of our common stock, subject to certain limitations until the requisite stockholder approval is obtained. The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will also be entitled to a separate class vote with respect to certain amendments to our charter documents, certain business combination transactions and certain other matters. The holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may vote in a manner that is deemed adverse to holders of our common stock. 
 The dividend and liquidation rights of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may adversely affect our financial position and the rights of the holders of our common stock. 
 The shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will accumulate dividends at a rate of 10 per annum, compounding quarterly and paid in kind as described above. However, if the requisite stockholder approval under NYSE rules has not been obtained, or the financing change of control amendment (as defined in the Certificate of Designations establishing the terms of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, which generally refers to the amendment of certain change of control provisions (or negotiation of such provisions, in the case of a refinancing) of our Credit Facilities, permitting Beyond and its affiliates to own 35 or more of our voting equity securities) has not been effectuated on or before December 31, 2024, which we refer to as the approvals deadline date, then on the approvals deadline date, and on each one-year anniversary thereto (if the requisite stockholder approval has not been obtained, or the financing change of control amendment has not been effectuated, by such anniversary), the dividend rate will be increased by an additional 100 basis points until such time that the requisite stockholder approval is obtained and the financing change of control amendment is effectuated, at which time the dividend rate will be readjusted to 10 per annum. The in kind payment feature for dividends on the convertible preferred stock may cause incremental dilution to holders of our common stock. 
 In addition, these dividend obligations, as well as the rights of holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock upon our liquidation, will be senior to the rights of holders of our common stock, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital. 
 If a change of control occurs, then the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will have the right, subject to the availability of sufficient legally available funds, to require us to repurchase their Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, which may require us to make a significant cash payment. 
 The Stockholders Agreement grants Beyond certain rights that may differ from the rights and privileges of other stockholders of the Company. 
 Upon completion of the Equity Investment, we and Beyond are expected to enter into a stockholders agreement (the Stockholders Agreement pursuant to which we will grant Beyond certain rights that may differ from the rights and privileges of our other stockholders. 
 Beyond's rights under the Stockholders Agreement include certain provisions that may allow it to influence or control the outcome of specific governance and corporate matters, potentially affecting the interests of other stockholders. Among other things, until the date that the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is required to convert into Common Stock in accordance with the Certificate of Designations (the Conversion Date ), for so long as the Beyond s percentage ownership of the Company (measured on an as-converted basis) (the Share Percentage Ownership is at least 10 , Beyond will have the right to nominate one director for election to the Board. After the Conversion Date, for so long as Beyond s Share Percentage Ownership is (a) at least 20 , Beyond will have the right to nominate two directors for election to the Board or (b) less than 20 but greater than 10 , Beyond will have the right to nominate one director for election to the Board. In addition, prior to the Conversion Date, Beyond has the right to designate one non-voting observer to the Board. 
 Additionally, until the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the Conversion Date and the date that the Collaboration Agreement is validly terminated by Beyond due to a material breach by us, we are required to provide Beyond with written notice of any unsolicited acquisition proposal regarding a potential fundamental change or change of control. In addition, for as long as Beyond s Share Percentage Ownership is at least 10 , if we decide to initiate a strategic alternatives process that could reasonably be expected to lead to a change of control transaction or other extraordinary transaction, we must provide Beyond with written notice and a bona fide opportunity to participate in such a process.

 These rights could deter third parties from pursuing strategic transactions with us. Beyond's interests may not always align with those of other stockholders, and its exercise of rights under the Stockholders Agreement could prevent us from taking actions that might otherwise benefit our stockholders or enhance our stock price. As a result, Beyond's influence under the Stockholders Agreement could adversely affect our business. 
 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 The persistently challenging retail environment, including reduced consumer spending in the storage and organization category and increased price sensitivity, has significantly impacted our performance and has placed pressure on our ability to meet the consolidated leverage ratio covenant in our Existing Term Loan Facility. On October 8, 2024, we entered into the Amendment to the Existing Term Loan Facility, which, among other things, waives the testing of the consolidated leverage ratio covenant for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and adds a covenant for us to enter into a qualified financing transaction, subject to the approval of the Required Lenders by November 15, 2024 (as such date may be extended by the Required Lenders). 
 Additionally, our Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of (a) November 25, 2025 and (b) October 31, 2025 if any portion of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility remains outstanding on such date and the maturity date of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility has not been extended. As of September 28, 2024, we had 160.3 million of borrowings outstanding net of deferred financing costs on the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, 71.0 million of borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility, and cash of 66.1 million. Subsequent to September 28, 2024, we drew down an additional 9.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with preparing the unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we evaluated our future liquidity and forecasted operating results for the next twelve months from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that, in light of the foregoing conditions, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern, absent consummating a transaction to provide additional liquidity or modifications to our existing credit facilities, which could further restrict our business operations. 
 We do not anticipate being able to access additional funds under our Revolving Credit Facility, as we are required to maintain a consolidated fixed-charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 if excess availability is less than 10,000 at any time. There is no assurance that we will successfully obtain additional financing or renegotiate the terms of our existing credit facilities. As described above, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement with Beyond, the completion of the Equity Investment is subject to a number of conditions, including our refinancing or amending our existing secured credit facilities in a manner that is commercially acceptable to Beyond. If we are not able to successfully consummate a transaction to provide additional liquidity, refinance our credit facilities or reach an agreement with our lenders to amend our credit facilities, we may need to scale back or discontinue certain or all of our operations to reduce costs or seek bankruptcy protection. 
 In addition, a failure to comply with our credit facilities, including the financial and operational covenants thereunder, or a failure to make scheduled payments on our debt, could result in an event of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding due and payable and exercise other remedies as set forth in the agreements and we may need to seek bankruptcy protection. 
 Our Rights Agreement, or poison pill, includes terms and conditions that could discourage a takeover or other transaction that stockholders may consider favorable. 
 On October 8, 2024, we entered into a Rights Agreement between the Company and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC as Rights Agent (as amended from time to time, the Rights Agreement that was previously approved by the Board. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, the Board declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (each, a Right for each share of our Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on October 23, 2024. Each Right will entitle the registered holder thereof, after the Rights become exercisable and until October 7, 2025 (or the earlier redemption, exchange, or termination of the Rights), to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Series A Preferred ), of the Company at a price of 65.00 per one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred. 
 The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects, including potentially discouraging a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable. The Rights Agreement will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that acquires beneficial ownership of 20 or more of the Company s Common Stock without the approval of the Board. As a result, the overall effect of the Rights Agreement and the issuance of the Rights may be to render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination involving the Company that is not approved by the Board. The Rights Agreement is not intended to interfere with any merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination approved

 by the Board at any time prior to the first date that a person or group has become an Acquiring Person as defined in the Rights Agreement. The Rights Agreement also does not prevent the Board from considering any offer that it considers to be in the best interest of its stockholders. On October 15, 2024, the parties entered into an Amendment to the Rights Agreement, which provides that none of Beyond, Inc., or its Permitted Transferees (as defined in the Purchase Agreement described elsewhere in this Form 10-Q) will be deemed an Acquiring Person for the purpose of the Rights Agreement as a result of the Equity Investment.
