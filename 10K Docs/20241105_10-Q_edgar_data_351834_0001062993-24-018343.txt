 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 For the quarters and three quarters ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 (Unaudited) 
 (All tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts) 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments' significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07. 

million; a short-term note receivable of million, which was paid in five consecutive monthly installments of million beginning 30 days following the Closing Date; secured seller promissory notes due in three years and with stated principal amounts of million entered into by Sunrise Growers and million entered into by SunOpta Mexico (the "Seller Promissory Notes"); and the assumption by the Purchasers of million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of Frozen Fruit. 
 The estimated aggregate purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustments based on a determination of the final net working capital and resulting aggregate purchase price as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Statement"), with adjustments to the aggregate purchase price determined on a separate and individual basis for each of Sunrise Growers, Sunrise Mexico and SunOpta Mexico. Any downward adjustment will be deducted from the principal amount of the Seller Promissory Notes entered into by Sunrise Growers and/or SunOpta Mexico, as the case may be, in an amount up to million in the aggregate, with any additional downward adjustment payable by the Company to the Purchasers in cash. The portion of any upward adjustment in the aggregate purchase price not paid to the Company by the Purchasers in cash will be added to the principal amount of the Seller Promissory Notes entered into by Sunrise Growers and/or SunOpta Mexico, as applicable. As at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company recorded a million net receivable from the Purchasers based on the Company's estimate of the final net working capital and post-closing adjustments, which is included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. However, this estimate may be subject to change, which could be material, as the parties are currently in the process of reconciling the final aggregate purchase price, including the resolution of certain disputed items in accordance with the procedures set forth in the APA. 
 As at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the principal amount of the Seller Promissory Notes of million, together with paid in kind interest of million and million, respectively, was recorded in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As described above, the final principal amount of the Sellers Promissory Notes may change as a result of any upward or downward adjustment to the aggregate purchase price in connection with the resolution of the Closing Statement. As at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company had not recorded any allowance for credit losses related to the Seller Promissory Notes. The Seller Promissory Notes are secured by a second-priority lien on certain assets of Frozen Fruit acquired by the Purchasers.

(1) For the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, cost of goods sold reflects the write down in the carrying value of the frozen fruit inventory that was not acquired by the Purchasers to its estimated net realizable value. Prior to the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed the disposal of the million of frozen fruit inventory held-for-sale as at December 30, 2023. 
 (2) For the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses include additional severance costs for former employees of Frozen Fruit not ultimately retained by the Purchasers, as well as the true-up of pre-divestiture profit-sharing bonuses payable to certain Mexican employees of Frozen Fruit. 
 (3) For the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, other expense mainly related to an additional self-insured retention amount paid by the Company in connection with the settlement of certain claims related to the recall of specific frozen fruit products initiated in the second quarter of 2023 (see note 14), partially offset by gains on the settlement of certain pre-existing legal matters related to Frozen Fruit. 
 (4) For the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, income tax expense reflects the final determination of the tax bases for the net assets of Frozen Fruit divested in Mexico. 

million. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of million, which is recorded in other income of continuing operations on the consolidated statement of operations for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024. 

million. The Agreement may be terminated by the Purchaser at any time with days' notice. 

The receivables sold under the Receivables Sales Program are without recourse to the Company for any customer credit risk. The Company does not retain any ongoing financial interest in the receivables sold under the Receivables Sales Program other than cash collection and administrative services. The Company has not recognized any servicing asset or liability as at September 28, 2024, as the fair values of the servicing arrangement and the fees earned are not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Receivables sold under the Receivables Sales Program are accounted for as sales of financial assets. The sold receivables are derecognized from accounts receivable on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at the time of sale to the Purchaser. The loss on sale of the sold receivables, representing the discount taken by the Purchaser, together with upfront transaction costs incurred by the Company in connection with the Agreement, amounted to million for the period from August 28, 2024 to September 28, 2024, which is included in other non-operating expense on the consolidated statements of operations for the quarter and three quarters ended September 28, 2024. Cash proceeds received from the Purchaser are classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 The following table summarizes activity related to the Receivables Sales Program:

 (2) Cash collected from customers on behalf of but not yet remitted to the Purchaser is included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as at September 28, 2024, with changes in such obligations reflected as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. There are no restrictions under the Agreement on the Company's use of the cash collected prior to the time it is due to be remitted to the Purchaser.

shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock ("Series B-1 Preferred Stock") issued and outstanding with Oaktree Organics, L.P. and Oaktree Huntington Investment Fund II, L.P. (collectively, "Oaktree"). As at September 28, 2024, the aggregate liquidation preference of the Series B-1 preferred stock was million, or approximately per share. The carrying value of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, net of unamortized issuance costs, is being accreted to the liquidation preference through charges to accumulated deficit, which amounted to million for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024 (September 30, 2023 - million). 

In the first quarter of 2024, the Company paid cash dividends on the Series B-1 Preferred Stock of million related to the fourth quarter of 2023. 

, while, at any time, SunOpta Foods may cause Oaktree to exchange all of their shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock if the volume-weighted average price of the Common Shares during the then preceding 20 trading day period is greater than 200 of the exchange price then in effect. 

As at September 28, 2024, the Company had Special Shares, Series 2 issued and outstanding, all of which are held by Oaktree. The Special Shares, Series 2 serve as a mechanism for attaching exchanged voting rights to the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and entitle the holder thereof to one vote per Special Share, Series 2 on all matters submitted to a vote of the holder of the Common Shares, voting together as a single class, subject to certain exemptions. As a result of a permanent voting cap, the number of Special Shares, Series 2 issued to Oaktree at any time, when taken together with any other voting securities Oaktree then controls, cannot exceed of the votes eligible to be cast by all security holders of the Company. 

performance share units ("PSUs") to selected employees under the Company's 2024 Short-Term Incentive Plan ("STIP"), which vest subject to the Company achieving a predetermined measure of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for fiscal 2024 and subject to the employee's continued employment with the Company through April 1, 2025 (the requisite service period). The grant-date fair value of each PSU was estimated to be based on the closing price of the Common Shares on the date of grant. For the period from the grant date to September 28, 2024, the Company recognized compensation expense of million related to the PSUs that are currently expected to vest, with the remaining compensation cost not yet recognized as an expense related to these PSUs determined to be million as at September 28, 2024, which will be amortized over the remaining requisite service period. 

On April 1 2024, the Company issued Common Shares, net of Common Shares withheld for taxes, in connection with the vesting of PSUs previously granted to selected employees under the Company's 2023 STIP. The total intrinsic value of these vested PSUs was million. 

Long-Term Incentive Plan 
 On April 30, 2024, the Company granted restricted stock units ("RSUs"), PSUs and stock options to selected employees under the Company's 2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP"). The RSUs vest in three equal annual installments beginning on April 30, 2025, and each vested RSU entitles the employee to receive one Common Share without payment of additional consideration. The vesting of one-half of the PSUs is contingent on the achievement of compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") benchmarks for revenue during the three-year performance period commencing January 1, 2024 and continuing through December 31, 2026, and the vesting of the other one-half of the PSUs is contingent on the achievement of return on invested capital ("ROIC") benchmarks within the same performance period, and subject to the employee's continued employment with the Company through April 30, 2027. The percentage of vested PSUs may range from to based on the Company's achievement of the predetermined CAGR and ROIC benchmarks. Each vested PSU entitles the employee to receive one Common Share without payment of additional consideration. The stock options vest ratably on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. Each vested stock option entitles the employee to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of , which was the closing price of the Common Shares on April 30, 2024. 
 The grant-date fair values of each RSU and PSU were estimated to be based on the closing price of the Common Shares on the date of grant. A grant-date fair value of was estimated for each stock option using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 

Exercise price 

Dividend yield 

Expected volatility (a) 

Risk-free interest rate (b) 

Expected life (in years) (c) 

(a) Determined based on the historical volatility of the Common Shares over expected life of the stock options. 
 (b) Determined based on U.S. Treasury yields with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock options. 
 (c) Determined based on the mid-point of vesting (three years) and expiration (ten years) for the stock options. 

The aggregate grant-date fair value of the RSUs, PSUs and stock options granted under the 2024 LTIP was determined to be million, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period ending April 30, 2027. 

Special Awards 
 On January 2, 2024, the Company granted special one-time awards of restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance share units ("PSUs") and stock options to Brian Kocher in connection with his appointment as the Company's Chief Executive Officer effective January 2, 2024. On March 13, 2024, the Company granted Mr. Kocher an additional RSUs, equal to the number of Common Shares purchased by Mr. Kocher on the open market within the 75-day period after his employment began. The RSUs vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, and each vested RSU entitles Mr. Kocher to receive one Common Share without payment of additional consideration. The vesting of the PSUs is dependent on the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") performance relative to food and beverage companies in a designated index during the three-year period commencing January 1, 2024 and continuing through December 31, 2026, and subject to Mr. Kocher's continued employment with the Company through April 15, 2027. The TSR for the Company and each of the companies in the designated index will be calculated using a 20-trading day average closing price as of December 31, 2026. The percentage of vested PSUs may range from to based on the Company's achievement of predetermined TSR thresholds. Each vested PSU entitles Mr. Kocher to receive one Common Share without payment of additional consideration. The stock options vest ratably on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. Each vested stock option entitles Mr. Kocher to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of , which was the closing price of the Common Shares on January 2, 2024. 

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the RSUs was estimated to be based on the closing prices of Common Shares on the dates of grant. A grant-date fair value of was estimated for the stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and a grant-date fair value of was estimated for the PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The following table summarizes the inputs to the Black-Scholes option-pricing and Monte Carlo valuation models:

The changes in the effective tax rate were primarily driven by the recognition of a full valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities beginning in the second quarter of 2023, based on the Company's assessment that the related tax benefits were no longer more likely than not to be realized in the future.

 Overview 
 We operate as an innovation partner, solutions provider, and value-added manufacturer for leading brands, and produce our own brands, including SOWN , Dream , and West Life TM . Our product portfolio comprises plant-based beverages, fruit snacks, nutritional beverages, broths, and teas, which are sold through retail, club, foodservice and e-commerce channels. We also produce liquid and dry ingredients for internal use and for sale to other food and beverage manufacturers. 
 On March 4, 2024, we completed the sale of the net assets related to our smoothie bowls product line and exited the category. 
 Fiscal 2024 Outlook 
 For full fiscal year 2024, we are projecting higher year-over-year revenues driven by organic volume growth from our beverages, broth and fruit snacks categories, partially offset by the impact of our exit from the smoothie bowls category. We anticipate an improved gross margin profile on a reported basis, compared with the prior year, reflecting higher production volumes and plant utilization to support sales, together with lower start-up costs and improved operating efficiencies at our Midlothian, Texas, facility. The resulting increase in gross profit, together with stable selling, general and administrative ("SG A") spending as a percentage of revenue, is expected to drive year-over-year operating income growth and improved cash flows.

Percentage not meaningful 

(1) Gross margin is a measure of gross profit (equal to revenues less cost of goods sold) as a percentage of revenues. We use a measure of adjusted gross margin that excludes non-capitalizable start-up costs included in cost of goods sold that are incurred in connection with capital expansion projects. Start-up costs have had a significant impact on the comparability of reported gross margins, which may obscure trends in our margin performance. Additionally, our measure of adjusted gross margin may exclude other unusual items that are identified and evaluated on an individual basis, which due to their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. 
 We use the measure of adjusted gross margin to evaluate the underlying profitability of our revenue-generating activities within each reporting period. We believe that disclosing this non-GAAP measure provides investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of our profitability measure for the periods presented. However, the non-GAAP measure of adjusted gross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gross margin calculated based on gross profit determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin from reported gross margin calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

For the third quarter of 2023, start-up costs of 4.7 million included in cost of goods sold mainly related to the initial ramp-up of production at our Midlothian, Texas, facility, and the addition of a new extrusion line at our fruit snacks facility in Omak, Washington. 
 (b) For the third quarter of 2024, we incurred temporary third-party haul-off charges of 2.2 million for excess wastewater produced at our Midlothian, Texas, facility, due to volume constraints within our current treatment system .

(2) When assessing our financial performance, we use an internal measure of adjusted earnings from continuing operations that excludes specific items that are identified and evaluated on an individual basis, which due to their unusual nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We believe that the identification of these excluded items enhances the analysis of the financial performance of our business when comparing those operating results between periods, as we do not consider these items to be reflective of normal business operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted earnings from continuing operations from loss from continuing operations which we consider to be the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.

 (b) Refer to footnote (1)(b) above for a description of wastewater haul-off charges included in cost of goods sold. 
 (c) For the third quarter of 2024, reflects an unrealized foreign exchange loss associated with peso-denominated bank accounts in Mexico that were retained following the divestiture of our frozen fruit business ("Frozen Fruit") in October 2023. These accounts are currently subject to a judicial hold in connection with a litigation matter. 
 (d) For the third quarter of 2023, reflects business development costs related to the divestiture of Frozen Fruit, which are recorded in SG A expenses. 
 (e) For the third quarter of 2023, reflects employee severance costs accrued in connection with the consolidation of our continuing operations following the divestiture of Frozen Fruit, which are recorded in SG A expenses. 
 (f) For the third quarter of 2024, other reflects accrued demolition costs related to our former roasted snack facility, which was abandoned in 2018. These costs are recorded in other expense. 
 We believe that investors' understanding of our financial performance is enhanced by disclosing the specific items that we exclude to compute adjusted earnings from continuing operations. However, adjusted earnings from continuing operations is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for loss from continuing operations prepared under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations is presented solely to allow investors to more fully understand how we assess our financial performance. 
 (3) We use a measure of adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations when assessing the performance of our operations, which we believe is useful to investors' understanding of our operating profitability because it excludes non-operating expenses, such as interest, loss on sale of receivables, and income taxes, as well as non-cash expenses, such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. In addition, our measure of adjusted EBITDA excludes other unusual items that affect the comparability of our operating performance, as identified in the determination of adjusted earnings from continuing operations (refer above to footnote (2)). We also use this measure of adjusted EBITDA to assess operating performance in connection with our employee incentive programs. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations from loss from continuing operations, which we consider to be the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.

 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; 

adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations excludes the discount taken on trade receivables sold to a third-party factor, which is a strategic means for us to improve working capital efficiency, while reducing our indebtedness and interest expense; 

adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations does not include the payment or recovery of income taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; 

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 

adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations does not include non-cash stock-based compensation, which is an important component of our total compensation program for employees and directors. 
 
 Because of these limitations, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by not viewing adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in isolation, and specifically by using other U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP measures, such as consolidated revenues, gross profit, gross margin, operating income, loss from continuing operations, and adjusted earnings from continuing operations to measure our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to our results of operations or cash flows from operations determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our calculation of adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations may not be comparable to the calculation of a similarly titled measure reported by other companies.

(4) In order to evaluate our results of operations, we use certain non-GAAP measures that we believe enhance an investor's ability to derive meaningful period-over-period comparisons and trends from our results of operations. For example, as described above under footnote (1), we evaluate our adjusted gross margins on a basis that excludes the impact of start-up costs and other unusual items. In addition, we exclude specific items from our reported results that due to their nature or size, we do not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. These items are identified above under footnote (2), and in the discussion of our results of operations below. These non-GAAP measures are presented solely to allow investors to more fully assess our results of operations and should not be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. 
 Revenues for the quarter ended September 28, 2024 increased by 15.5 to 176.2 million from 152.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The change in revenues from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 was due to the following:

15.5 

For the quarter ended September 28, 2024, the 15.5 increase in revenues reflected a favorable volume/mix impact of 20.6 , partially offset by a 2.8 overall price reduction due to the pass-through of lower commodity costs for certain raw materials, together with a 2.3 revenue loss related to our exit from the smoothie bowls category in March 2024. The favorable volume/mix reflected the incremental output from our capital expansion projects, together with new product innovation launches, which produced sales volume growth with existing and new customers across our fruit snack, broth, plant-based beverage, and protein shake product lines. 
 Gross profit increased 3.3 million, or 16.4 , to 23.6 million for the quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared with 20.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin was 13.4 for the quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared with 13.3 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 10 basis points. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, we incurred start-up costs included in cost of goods sold of 4.1 million (2.4 gross margin impact), compared with start-up costs of 4.7 million (3.1 gross margin impact) for the third quarter of 2023. Start-up costs for the third quarter of 2024, were mainly related to the scale-up of production at our plant-based beverage facility in Midlothian, Texas, including the start-up of a new high-speed Edge line. In addition, for the third quarter of 2024, we incurred temporary third-party haul-off charges of 2.2 million (1.2 gross margin impact) for excess wastewater produced at our plant-based beverage facility in Midlothian, Texas, due to volume constraints within our current treatment system . Excluding the impact of start-up costs and wastewater charges, adjusted gross margin was 17.0 for the quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared with 16.4 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 60 basis points. See footnote (1) to the Consolidated Results of Operations for the Quarters Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 table for a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin from gross margin calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 The 60-basis point increase in adjusted gross margin reflected higher sales and production volumes for fruit snacks, broths and beverages driving improved plant utilization, partially offset by the impact of incremental depreciation of new production equipment related to capital expansion projects 1.3 million or 0.8 gross margin impact), together with manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from the excess wastewater issue. 
 Operating income was 1.5 million for each of the quarters ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Operating income for the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, reflected higher gross profit, as described above, together with lower business development and employee severance costs following the divestiture of Frozen Fruit and related consolidation of our continuing operations in 2023, offset by higher employee variable compensation accruals based on performance, and increased professional fees related to operational productivity initiatives. 
 (Further details on the changes in revenue, gross profit and operating income are provided in the rollforward tables below.) 
 Net interest expense decreased by 0.4 million to 6.8 million for the quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared with 7.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which reflected lower average outstanding debt in the third quarter of 2024 following the divestiture of Frozen Fruit, partially offset by the impact of higher market interest rates. 

SUNOPTA INC.

 September 28, 2024 Form 10-Q 

Other non-operating expense of 0.2 million for the quarter ended September 28, 2024, reflected the loss on sale of certain trade receivables to a third-party financial institution under the Receivables Sales Program that we entered into in the third quarter of 2024 (as described below under "Liquidity and Capital Resources"). 
 Income taxes were recognized at effective tax rates of (0.4) and 0.0 for the quarters ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, which reflected the recognition of a full valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities beginning in the second quarter of 2023. 
 Loss from continuing operations was 5.5 million for the quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared with a loss of 5.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders (after accretion on preferred stock) was 0.05 for the quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared with a diluted loss per share (after dividends and accretion on preferred stock) of 0.05 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 We recognized a loss from discontinued operations of 140.1 million (diluted loss per share of 1.21) for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which included an estimated pre-tax loss on the divestiture of Frozen Fruit of 118.8 million. Refer to note 2 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details. 
 We realized a loss attributable to common shareholders of 5.6 million (diluted loss per share of 0.05) for the quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared with a loss attributable to common shareholders of 146.2 million (diluted loss per share of 1.26) for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 2.5 million, or 0.02 earnings per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared with adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 0.5 million, or 0.00 earnings per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased 2.4 million, or 12.6 , to 21.5 million for the quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared with 19.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations are non-GAAP financial measures. See footnotes (2) and (3) to the "Consolidated Results of Operations for the Quarters Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023" table for a reconciliation of adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations from loss from continuing operations, which we consider to be the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.

(a) For the first three quarters of 2024, start-up costs of 6.8 million were recorded in costs of goods sold, which were mainly related to the scale-up of production at our plant-based beverage facility in Midlothian, Texas, including the start-up of a new high-speed Edge line, together with the ramp-up of oat-base extraction operations at our Modesto, California, facility. For the first three quarters of 2023, start-up costs of 16.3 million included in cost of goods sold mainly related to the initial ramp-up of production at our Midlothian, Texas, facility, and the addition of new extrusion and high-speed packaging lines at our fruit snacks facility in Omak, Washington. 
 (b) For the first three quarters of 2024, we incurred temporary third-party haul-off charges of 3.6 million for excess wastewater produced at our Midlothian, Texas, facility, due to volume constraints within our current treatment system . 
 (c) In the second quarter of 2024, we conducted a voluntary withdrawal from customers of certain batches of aseptically-packaged products that may have had the potential for non-pathogenic microbial contamination. None of the withdrawn product made it into the consumer marketplace. In the second and third quarters of 2024, we recognized direct costs related to the withdrawal of 2.1 million, net of expected insurance recoveries, which included finished goods inventory write-offs, product return and logistic costs, and costs related to investigative and remedial actions taken in response to the withdrawal, which corrective actions have been completed. These charges are incremental to our normal course reserves and have had an unfavorable impact on our reported gross profit and gross margin for the first three quarters of 2024.

 Revenues for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024 increased by 18.1 to 530.1 million from 448.7 million for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023. The change in revenues from the first three quarters of 2023 to the first three quarters of 2024 was due to the following:

Note: percentages may not add due to rounding 
 For the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, the 18.1 increase in revenues reflected a favorable volume/mix impact of 23.6 , partially offset by a 3.9 overall price reduction due to the pass-through of lower commodity costs for certain raw materials, together with a 1.5 revenue loss related to our exit from the smoothie bowls category in March 2024. The favorable volume/mix reflected the incremental output from our capital expansion projects, together with new product innovation launches, which produced sales volume growth with existing and new customers across our fruit snack, broth, tea, protein shake, and plant-based beverage product lines. 
 Gross profit increased 14.2 million, or 22.6 , to 77.2 million for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared with 63.0 million for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin was 14.6 for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared with 14.0 for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 60 basis points. 
 For the first three quarters of 2024, we incurred start-up costs included in cost of goods sold of 6.8 million (1.3 gross margin impact), compared with start-up costs of 16.3 million (3.6 gross margin impact) for the first three quarters of 2023. Start-up costs for the first three quarters of 2024, were mainly related to the scale-up of production at our plant-based beverage facility in Midlothian, Texas, including the start-up of a new high-speed Edge line, together with the ramp-up of oat-base extraction operations at our Modesto, California, facility. In addition, for the first three quarters of 2024, we incurred temporary third-party haul-off charges of 3.6 million (0.7 gross margin impact) for excess wastewater produced at our plant-based beverage facility in Midlothian, Texas, due to volume constraints within our current treatment system , and, in the second and third quarters of 2024, we recognized direct costs of 2.1 million (0.4 gross margin impact), net of expected insurance recoveries, related to our voluntary withdrawal in the second quarter of 2024, of certain batches of aseptically-packaged products that may have had the potential for non-pathogenic microbial contamination. Excluding the impact of start-up costs, wastewater charges and product withdrawal costs, adjusted gross margin was 16.9 for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared with 17.7 for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 80 basis points. See footnote (1) to the Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Quarters Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 table for a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin from gross margin calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

SUNOPTA INC.

 September 28, 2024 Form 10-Q 

The 80-basis point decrease in adjusted gross margin reflected the impact of incremental depreciation of new production equipment related to capital expansion projects completed in 2023 4.2 million or 0.8 gross margin impact), together with manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from the excess wastewater and product withdrawal issues, and higher inventory reserves, partially offset by higher sales and production volumes for beverages, fruit snacks and broths driving improved plant utilization. 
 Operating income increased 11.1 million to 14.3 million for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared with 3.2 million for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating income reflected higher gross profit, as described above, together with a gain on sale of the smoothie bowls product line of 1.8 million, and lower business development and employee severance costs following the divestiture of Frozen Fruit and related consolidation of our continuing operations in 2023. These factors were partially offset by higher variable employee compensation accruals based on performance, together with higher stock-based compensation expense due to the timing of our annual incentive plan grants and the accelerated vesting of certain previously granted awards in connection with the retirement of our former Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). In addition, in the first three quarters of 2024, we recognized an unrealized foreign exchange loss of 1.4 million on peso-denominated restricted cash held in Mexico. 
 (Further details on the changes in revenue, gross profit and operating income are provided in the rollforward tables below.) 
 Net interest expense decreased by 0.2 million to 19.2 million for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared with 19.4 million for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023, which reflected lower average outstanding debt in the first three quarters of 2024 following the divestiture of Frozen Fruit, partially offset by the impact of higher market interest rates. 
 Other non-operating expense of 0.2 million for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, reflected the loss on sale of certain trade receivables to a third-party financial institution under the Receivables Sales Program that we entered into in the third quarter of 2024 (as described below under "Liquidity and Capital Resources"). 
 Income taxes were recognized at an effective rate of (5.5) for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared with (24.6) recognized for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the recognition of a full valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities beginning in the second quarter of 2023. 
 Loss from continuing operations was 5.4 million for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared with a loss of 20.2 million for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders (after accretion on preferred stock) was 0.05 for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared with a diluted loss per share (after dividends and accretion on preferred stock) of 0.19 for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023. 
 We recognized a loss from discontinued operations related to Frozen Fruit of 2.3 million (diluted loss per share of 0.02) for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared with a loss of 143.1 million (diluted loss per share of 1.26) for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023, which included an estimated pre-tax loss on the divestiture of Frozen Fruit of 118.8 million recognized in the third quarter of 2023. Refer to note 2 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details. 
 We realized a loss attributable to common shareholders of 8.2 million (diluted loss per share of 0.07) for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared with a loss attributable to common shareholders of 164.8 million (diluted loss per share of 1.45) for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023.

Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 7.3 million, or 0.06 earnings per diluted share, for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared with adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 3.4 million, or 0.03 earnings per diluted share, for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased 8.5 million, or 15.1 , to 64.7 million for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared with 56.2 million for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations are non-GAAP financial measures. See footnotes (2) and (3) to the "Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Quarters Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023" table for a reconciliation of adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations from loss from continuing operations, which we consider to be the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 On December 8, 2023, we entered into a five-year Credit Agreement providing for a 180.0 million term loan credit facility (the "Term Loan Credit Facility") and an 85.0 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") (collectively, the "Credit Facilities"). As at September 28, 2024, 175.5 million remained outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Facility and we had utilized 56.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility, including 5.9 million in letters of credit. For more information on our Credit Facilities, see note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 In connection with our efforts to extend payment terms with our major suppliers to enhance cash flows, we are financing certain purchases of goods and services through extended payables facilities, by which third-party intermediaries settle the supplier invoice on the contractual due date and issue us a short-term note payable for the face amount of the invoice, which we repay, together with interest, at a later date. As at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we had 13.0 million and 17.6 million principal amount outstanding under these facilities, respectively. Proceeds from, and repayments of, the notes payable associated with these facilities are reported as financing cash flows on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

On August 28, 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell, from time to time, on a revolving basis, up to 30.0 million aggregate amount of trade receivables of eligible customers to a third-party financial institution in exchange for cash proceeds (the "Receivables Sales Program" - see note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information). Additionally, we utilize, from time to time, supply chain finance ("SCF") programs offered by some of our major customers that allow us to sell our receivables from those customers to such customers' financial institutions. We utilize our Receivables Sales Program and our customers' SCF programs in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms with the customers provide, and at a discount rate that leverages those customers' favorable credit ratings. Utilizing these programs accelerates our cash flows and improves working capital efficiency, while providing a lower cost access to liquidity when compared to the Revolving Credit Facility. All cash flows associated with these programs are reported as operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 On April 17, 2024, we eliminated the dividend rights attached to the shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock of our subsidiary, SunOpta Foods Inc., effective from and after December 31, 2023 (see note 9 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this report). The elimination of the cumulative dividend of 8.0 per year will result in annual savings of 1.2 million. 
 For the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, we incurred capital expenditures of 22.8 million. For fiscal 2024, we estimate total capital expenditures of approximately 15 million for discretionary investments in growth and productivity projects, and approximately 15 million of non-discretionary maintenance projects. We are funding our capital expenditures using operating cash flows and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, in the first three quarters of 2024, we added 24.6 million of finance lease right-of-use assets related to the expansion of our ingredient extraction operations at our Modesto, California, facility. 
 We believe that our operating cash flows, including the selective use of our Receivables Sales Program and customer SCF programs to improve collection terms, together with available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and extended payable facilities, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing needs for the foreseeable future, including the 12-month period following the issuance of our financial statements. However, in order to finance significant investments in our existing businesses, or significant business acquisitions, if any, that may arise in the future, we may need additional sources of cash that we could attempt to obtain through a combination of additional bank or subordinated financing, a private or public offering of debt or equity securities, or the issuance of common stock. There can be no assurance that these types of financing would be available at all or, if so, on terms that are acceptable to us. 
 Cash Flows 
 Summarized cash flow information for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, is as follows:

Operating Activities of Continuing Operations 
 Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased 27.6 million from the first three quarters of 2023 to the first three quarters of 2024. The increase in cash provided mainly reflected improved working capital efficiency attributable to our Receivables Sales Program, together with improved profitability, driven by revenue volume growth and lower start-up costs related to our Midlothian, Texas, facility, partially offset by a pre-season build of broth inventories, together with unrecovered product withdrawal costs.

 September 28, 2024 Form 10-Q 

Investing Activities of Continuing Operations 
 Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations decreased 20.8 million from the first three quarters of 2023 to the first three quarters of 2024, which mainly reflected lower capital expenditures following the completion of certain major capital projects in 2023, including the construction of our new plant-based beverage facility in Midlothian, Texas. In addition, in the first three quarters of 2024, we received cash proceeds of 6.3 million from the sale of the smoothie bowls product line. 
 Financing Activities of Continuing Operations 
 Cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was 4.9 million for the first three quarters of 2024, which reflected repayments of long-term debt related to completed capital projects, together with net repayments of notes payable in connection with our extended payables facilities, partially offset by borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund capital expenditures. Cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was 45.7 million for the first three quarters of 2023, which reflected net proceeds from notes payable, together with borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund working capital and capital expenditures, partially offset by repayments of long-term debt related to completed capital projects, and the payment of withholding taxes on employee stock-based awards. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 Net cash provided by discontinued operations of 4.0 million for the first three quarters of 2024, reflected proceeds of 6.3 million from the remaining short-term note receivable related to the Frozen Fruit divestiture, partially offset by the settlement of pre-divestiture obligations. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenues and expenses, and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and assumptions made require us to exercise our judgment and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the information that forms the basis of our estimates and assumptions as our business and the business environment generally changes. 
 There have been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates disclosed under the heading "Critical Accounting Estimates" in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of the Form 10-K. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Such disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and our CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2024.
