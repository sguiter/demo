 The Capped Call Transactions are accounted for as derivative instruments and do not qualify for the Company s own equity scope exception in ASC 815 since, in some cases of early settlement, the settlement value calculated following the governing documents may not represent a fair value measurement. The Capped Call Transactions are remeasured to fair value each reporting period, resulting in a non-operating gain or loss.

 Effective income tax rate ) ) 
 The Company s effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is impacted by the jurisdictional mix and timing of the actual compared to projected earnings (losses). It is also impacted by the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets in the U.S. and U.K. and a near break-even year-to-date pretax loss resulting in a not meaningful effective income tax rate. 
 The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. A deferred tax valuation allowance requires significant judgment and uncertainties, including assumptions about future taxable income. Quarterly, the Company reassesses the need for a valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets by weighting all available and objectively verifiable negative and positive evidence, including projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, committed contractual backlog Backlog ), projected future taxable income, including the impact of enacted legislation, tax-planning strategies, and recent operating results.

for trade secret misappropriation and for violating the Virginia Computer Crimes Act. On September 15, 2022, the circuit court of Fairfax County entered judgment of , consisting of the damages previously awarded by the jury plus attorneys fees and costs, and stating that the judgment is subject to post-judgment interest at a rate of per annum, from the date of the jury verdict (May 9, 2022) as to the amount of the jury verdict and from September 15, 2022 as to the amount of the award of attorneys fees and costs. On September 15, 2022, the Company filed a notice of appeal from the judgment. On September 29, 2022, the circuit court of Fairfax County approved a letter of credit obtained by the Company to secure the judgment and entered an order suspending the judgment during the pendency of the Company s appeal. A panel of the Court of Appeals of Virginia heard oral arguments on November 15, 2023, and issued a written opinion on July 30, 2024. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment on Appian s Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act claim and ordered a new trial on that claim. Appian filed a petition for appeal with the Supreme Court of Virginia on August 29, 2024, and the Company filed a response to the petition on October 21, 2024. Although it is not possible to predict timing, the entirety of the appeals process could potentially take years to complete. The Company continues to believe that it did not misappropriate any alleged trade secrets and that its sales of the Company s products at issue were not caused by, or the result of, any alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate possible damages because of, among other things, uncertainty as to the outcome of appellate proceedings and/or any potential new trial resulting from the appellate proceedings.

 On May 19, 2022, a lawsuit was filed against the Company, the Company s chief executive officer, and the Company s chief operating and financial officer in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia Alexandria Division, captioned City of Fort Lauderdale Police and Firefighters Retirement System, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Pegasystems Inc., Alan Trefler, and Kenneth Stillwell (Case 1:22-cv-00578-LMB-IDD). The complaint generally alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and that the individual defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case by allegedly making materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as allegedly failing to disclose material adverse facts about the Company s business, operations, and prospects, which caused the Company s securities to trade at artificially inflated prices. The complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a class of purchasers of the Company s securities between May 29, 2020 and May 9, 2022. The litigation has since been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Case 1:22-cv-11220-WGY), and lead plaintiff class representatives - Central Pennsylvania Teamsters Pension Fund - Defined Benefit Plan, Central Pennsylvania Teamsters Pension Fund - Retirement Income Plan 1987, and Construction Industry Laborers Pension Fund - have been appointed. On October 18, 2022, a consolidated amended complaint was filed that does not add any new parties or legal claims, is based upon the same general factual allegations as the original complaint, and now seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a class of purchasers of the Company s securities between June 16, 2020 and May 9, 2022. The Company moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on December 19, 2022. The hearing on the Company s motion to dismiss took place on May 17, 2023. After hearing argument from both sides, the Court denied the Company s motion from the bench and stated that a written opinion would follow. On June 30, 2023, the Company filed its Answer to the complaint. On July 24, 2023, the Court issued its written opinion denying the motion to dismiss as to the Company and Defendant Trefler but granting the motion without prejudice as to Mr. Stillwell. 
 On March 4, 2024, the parties agreed in principle to a proposed settlement of the litigation for an aggregate sum of million. On April 23, 2024, the parties executed a stipulation of settlement. On April 23, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking preliminary approval of the settlement. On May 15, 2024, the Court granted plaintiffs motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. On September 6, 2024, the Company received notice that certain shareholders, representing approximately 3 of the settlement class, would be excluded from the settlement. On September 19, 2024, the Court approved the settlement, including an award of attorneys fees and the plan of allocation, and thereafter, on September 25, 2024, entered Final Judgment.

 NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 Our non-GAAP financial measures should only be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these measures help investors understand our core operating results and prospects, which is consistent with how management measures and forecasts our performance without the effect of often one-time charges and other items outside our normal operations. Management uses these measures to assess the performance of the company's operations and establish operational goals and incentives. They are not a substitute for financial measures prepared under U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures is located with each non-GAAP measure.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared following accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. and the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Preparing these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and expectations of what could occur in the future based on the available information. 
 For more information about our critical accounting policies, we encourage you to read the discussion in the following locations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023:

The decreases in selling and marketing during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to decreases in compensation and benefits of 2.4 million and 27.5 million, respectively, from reduced headcount as a result of our effort to optimize our go-to-market strategy. For additional information, see "Note 9. Restructuring" in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 The decrease in research and development for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits of 1.1 million.

 The increases in general and administrative during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of 3.1 million and 7.2 million, respectively, due to increases in incentive-based compensation. 
 The increase in litigation settlement, net of recoveries in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the cost to settle litigation arising from proceedings outside the ordinary course of business. See "Note 15.

 The changes in foreign currency transaction (loss) gain in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with foreign currency-denominated cash and receivables held by our subsidiary in the United Kingdom. 
 The increases in interest income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to higher investment balances and higher interest rate yields. 
 The changes in (loss) on capped call transactions in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were due to fair value adjustments for our capped call transactions. 
 The decrease in other income, net in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to a gain of 6.4 million on our venture investments in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other income, net in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to a gain of 7.9 million from repurchases of our convertible senior notes and a decrease of 9.3 million in the gain from our venture investments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Provision for income taxes Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Provision for income taxes 8,369 15,395 Effective income tax rate (73) (26) 
 Our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is impacted by the jurisdictional mix and timing of the actual compared to projected earnings (losses). It is also impacted by the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and U.K. and a near break-even year-to-date pretax loss resulting in a not meaningful effective income tax rate. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD has introduced new global minimum tax regulations, known as Pillar Two, that began to come into effect on January 1, 2024. We are monitoring this development and evaluating its potential impact on our tax rate and eligibility to qualify for the safe harbor provisions. For 2024, we currently anticipate meeting the transitional safe harbors in most jurisdictions, with any remaining top-up tax being immaterial.

 714,406 426,263 
 We believe that our current cash, marketable securities, cash flow provided by operations, borrowing capacity, and ability to engage in capital market transactions will be sufficient to fund our operations, settlement of our convertible senior notes due on March 1, 2025, stock repurchases, and quarterly cash dividends for at least the next 12 months and to meet our known long-term cash requirements. Whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our future growth, operating results, and the investments needed to support our operations. We may utilize available funds or seek external financing if we require additional capital resources. 
 If it becomes necessary or desirable to repatriate foreign funds, we may have to pay federal, state, and local income taxes as well as foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation. However, estimating the taxes we would have to pay is impracticable due to the complexity of income tax laws and regulations. 
 Operating activities 
 The change in cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to growth in client collections and the impact of our cost-efficiency initiatives. For additional information, see Note 9. Restructuring and "Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies" in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Investing activities 
 The change in cash (used in) investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to our investments in financial instruments and reduced investment in property and equipment as we optimized our office space. 
 Financing activities 
 Debt financing 
 In February 2020, we issued 600 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, which mature on March 1, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, we had 502.3 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes outstanding. For additional information, see "Note 8. Debt" in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 In November 2019, and as since amended, we entered into a 100 million senior secured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Facility with PNC Bank, National Association. On April 23, 2024, the Credit Facility was amended to extend the expiration date to February 4, 2025. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 27.3 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility, reducing available borrowing capacity, but no outstanding cash borrowings. For additional information, see "Note 8. Debt" in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. 
 Foreign currency exposure 
 Translation risk 
 Our international operations operating expenses are primarily denominated in foreign currencies. However, our international sales are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies, partially offsetting our foreign currency exposure.

 Remeasurement risk 
 We incur transaction gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. 
 We are primarily exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with the Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar-denominated cash, cash equivalents, receivables, and intercompany balances held by our U.K. subsidiary, a British pound functional entity. 
 A hypothetical 10 strengthening in the British pound exchange rate in comparison to the Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar would have resulted in the following impact: Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Foreign currency (loss) (12,771) (11,351) 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
