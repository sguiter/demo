 BAQSIMI product rights Deferred tax assets Total assets acquired The Company amortizes the acquired intangible asset to cost of revenues on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of 24 years (see Note 10 for additional information). A portion of the consideration for the asset acquisition was a deferred cash payment. The fair value of the deferred cash payment was accreted to its full million amount over a period from the date of acquisition through interest expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million of interest expense related to accretion of the deferred cash payment. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, million of interest expense was recognized related to the accretion of the deferred cash payment. The Company made the million deferred cash payment in June 2024. The Company may also be required to pay additional contingent consideration of up to an aggregate of million in cash as part of the BAQSIMI acquisition, based on the achievement of certain net sales milestones. Through September 30, 2024, the Company has not triggered any milestones and therefore no amounts have been recognized or paid. Manufacturing Services Agreement In connection with the closing of the acquisition, the Company entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement, or the MSA, with Lilly, pursuant to which Lilly has agreed, for a period of time not to exceed , to provide certain manufacturing, packaging, labeling and supply services for BAQSIMI directly or through third-party contractors to the Company in connection with its operation of the development, manufacture, and commercialization of BAQSIMI . Upon termination of the MSA, the Company will be obligated to purchase all API, components, and finished goods on hand at prices agreed upon in the MSA. Transition Services Agreement In connection with the closing of the acquisition, the Company also entered into a Transition Services Agreement, or the TSA, with Lilly pursuant to which Lilly has agreed, for a period of time not to exceed , to provide certain services to the Company to support the transition of BAQSIMI operations to the Company, including with respect to the conduct of certain clinical, regulatory, medical affairs, and commercial sales channel activities. Throughout 2024, the Company assumed distribution responsibilities, from Lilly, to its customers in the United States, and certain other countries. As a result, the Company has recorded the sales and related cost of BAQSIMI in these countries as product revenue, net and cost of revenues, respectively. The Company will continue to assume distribution of BAQSIMI for the remaining territories on a country by country basis throughout 2024.

 ; however, payment terms differ by jurisdiction, by customer and, in some instances, by type of product. Revenues from product sales, net of gross-to-net deductions, are recorded only to the extent a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized is not probable of occurring when the uncertainty associated with gross-to-net deductions is subsequently resolved. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers are excluded from product sales. If the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of control and corresponding payment from the customer will be one year or less, the amount of consideration is not adjusted for the effects of a financing component. Shipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities rather than a separate performance obligation and are recorded within selling, distribution and marketing expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Provision for Chargebacks and Rebates: The provision for chargebacks and rebates is a significant estimate used in the recognition of revenue. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to sales terms under which the Company agrees to reimburse wholesalers for differences between the gross sales prices at which the Company sells its products to wholesalers and the actual prices of such products that wholesalers resell under the Company s various contractual arrangements with third parties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations in the United States. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to retailers, payers, and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements. The Company estimates chargebacks and rebates using the expected value method at the time of sale to wholesalers based on wholesaler inventory stocking levels, historical chargeback and rebate rates, and current contract pricing. The provision for chargebacks and rebates is reflected as a component of product revenues, net. The following table is an analysis of the chargeback and rebate provision: Provision for chargebacks and rebates Credits and payments issued to third parties ) ) Ending balance Changes in the chargeback provision from period to period are primarily dependent on the Company s sales to its wholesalers, the level of inventory held by wholesalers, and the wholesalers customer mix. Changes in the rebate provision from period to period are primarily dependent on retailers and other indirect customers purchases. The approach that the Company uses to estimate chargebacks and rebates has been consistently applied for all periods

Table of Contents AMPHASTAR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 
 to after the sale to wholesalers. Accounts receivable and/or accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reduced and/or increased by the chargebacks and rebate amounts depending on whether the Company has the right to offset with the customer. The provision for chargebacks and rebates is included in the following balance sheet accounts: Accounts payable and accrued liabilities Total Accrual for Product Returns: The Company offers certain customers the right to return qualified excess or expired inventory for partial credit; however, API product sales are generally non-returnable. The Company s product returns primarily consist of the returns of expired products from sales made in prior periods. Returned products cannot be resold. At the time product revenue is recognized, the Company records an accrual for product returns estimated using the expected value method. The accrual is based, in part, upon the historical relationship of product returns to sales and customer contract terms. The Company also assesses other factors that could affect product returns including market conditions, product obsolescence, and new competition. Prompt Pay Discounts: The Company provides its customers with a percentage discount on their invoice if the customers pay within the agreed upon timeframe. The Company expects that its customers will earn prompt pay discounts. The Company estimates the probability of customers paying promptly based on the percentage of discount outlined in the purchase agreement between the two parties, and deducts the full amount of these discounts from gross product sales and accounts receivable at the time revenue is recognized. Distributor Fees: The Company engages with wholesalers to distribute its products to end customers. The Company pays the wholesalers a fee for services such as: inventory management, chargeback administration, and service level commitments. The Company estimates the amount of distribution services fees to be paid and adjusts the transaction price with the amount of such estimate at the time of sale to the customer. An accrued liability is recorded for unpaid distribution service fees. Patient Co-Pay Assistance: Co-pay assistance represents financial assistance to qualified patients, assisting them with prescription drug co-payments required by insurance. The accrual for co-pay is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that the Company expects to receive associated with inventory that exists in the distribution channel at period end. Revenues derived from contract manufacturing services are recognized when third-party products are shipped to customers. The Company s accounting policy is to review each agreement involving contract development and manufacturing services to determine if there are multiple revenue-generating activities that constitute more than one unit of accounting. Revenues are recognized for each unit of accounting based on revenue recognition criteria relevant to that unit. Service revenues derived from research and development contracts are recognized over time based on progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation. For each performance obligation satisfied over time, the Company assesses the proper method to be used for revenue recognition, either an input method to measure progress toward the satisfaction of services or an output method of determining the progress of completion of performance obligation. For the three and

 million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenues from research and development services were million and million, respectively. Other revenues Revenues related to sales of BAQSIMI , which was supplied and sold by Lilly under the TSA during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, or BAQSIMI NEB, were recorded on a net basis, similar to a royalty arrangement. This includes revenues in the United States and certain other countries for a portion of the period. shares of stock with a weighted-average exercise price of per share, were excluded in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. The 2029 Convertible Notes had no impact on the computation of diluted net income per share as the average stock price during the period was less than the conversion price. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, none of the Company s options were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, options to purchase shares of stock with a weighted-average exercise price of per share, were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

 large wholesale drug distributors, Cencora Inc., formally AmerisourceBergen, or Cencora, Cardinal Health, Inc., or Cardinal, and McKesson Corporation, or McKesson, are all distributors of the Company s products, as well as suppliers of a broad range of health care products. Lilly currently manufactures and sells BAQSIMI on the Company s behalf pursuant to the terms of the TSA in certain jurisdictions (see Note 3 for additional information). The Company considers these customers to be its major customers, as each individually, and these customers collectively, represented a significant percentage of the Company s net revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The following table provides accounts receivable and net revenue information for these major customers: Cencora Cardinal Health Lilly Supplier Concentrations The Company depends on suppliers for raw materials, APIs, and other components that are subject to stringent FDA requirements. Some of these materials may only be available from one or a limited number of sources. Establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these materials may take a substantial period of time, as suppliers must be approved by the FDA. Furthermore, a significant portion of raw materials may only be available from foreign sources. If the Company is unable to secure, on a timely basis, sufficient quantities of the materials it depends on to manufacture and market its products, it could have a materially adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.

 Income tax provision Income before equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliate Income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes Valuation Allowance In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will be realized. Ultimately, realization depends on the existence of future taxable income. Management considers sources of taxable income such as income in prior carryback periods, future reversal of existing deferred taxable temporary differences, tax-planning strategies, and projected future taxable income. The Company continues to record a full valuation allowance on the net deferred income tax assets of its France subsidiary, AFP, and its U.K. subsidiaries, AUK and IMS UK. The Company will continue to do so until the subsidiaries generate sufficient taxable income to realize their respective deferred income tax assets. The Company records a valuation allowance on net deferred income tax assets in states where it files separately and will continue to do so until sufficient taxable income is generated to realize these state deferred income tax assets. and shares of its common stock, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for total consideration of million and million, respectively.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion and analysis of the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or Quarterly Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, among others, those identified under the Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements, above and described in greater detail elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors . Overview We are a bio-pharmaceutical company focusing primarily on developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling technically challenging generic and proprietary injectable, inhalation, and intranasal products, as well as insulin API products. We currently manufacture and sell over 25 products. Our largest products by net revenues currently include BAQSIMI , Primatene MIST , glucagon, epinephrine, lidocaine, enoxaparin sodium, and phytonadione. We are currently developing a portfolio of generic abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, biosimilar insulin product candidates and proprietary product candidates, which are in various stages of development and target a variety of indications. Four of the ANDAs are currently on file with the FDA. To complement our internal growth and expertise, we have made several strategic acquisitions of companies, products and technologies. These acquisitions collectively have strengthened our injectable, inhalation, and intra-nasal product technology infrastructure by providing additional manufacturing, marketing, and research and development capabilities, including the ability to manufacture raw materials, API, and other components for our products. Macroeconomic Trends and Uncertainties Recent uncertain macroeconomic conditions and worldwide events, including extended periods of heightened inflation, fluctuating interest rates and instability in the financial systems, ongoing geopolitical conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts, as well as rising healthcare costs continue to pose challenges to our business. See the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further discussion of the potential adverse impact of unfavorable global and geopolitical economic conditions on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. Recent Developments BAQSIMI Acquisition In connection with the acquisition of BAQSIMI in June 2023, we entered into a Transition Service Agreement, or the TSA, with Eli Lilly Company, or Lilly, pursuant to which Lilly agreed, for a period of time not to exceed 18 months to provide certain services to us to support the transition of the BAQSIMI operations, including with respect to the conduct of certain clinical, regulatory, medical affairs, and commercial sales channel activities. Revenues from the sales of BAQSIMI under the TSA with Lilly during the transition period were recognized on a net basis, similar to a royalty arrangement. The impact of this revenue recognition method resulted in lower reported revenues relative to the revenue that would have been reported had we recognized gross revenues from sales of BAQSIMI . 

 - 32 - 

Table of Contents 
 Throughout 2024, we assumed distribution responsibilities from Lilly to our customers in the United States, which comprises approximately 80 of BAQSIMI worldwide revenues, as well as certain other countries. As a result, we started recognizing gross revenues and cost of revenues from the sales of BAQSIMI in these countries, which is classified as product revenue, net and cost of revenue, respectively on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The assumption of distribution in countries outside the United States will occur on a country-by-country basis once the marketing authorizations for each territory have been transferred to us, we have set up distribution agreements, and we have obtained sufficient inventory. For more information regarding our acquisition of BAQSIMI , see Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. BAQSIMI Acquisition. Business Segments As of September 30, 2024, our performance is assessed and resources are allocated based on the following two reportable segments: (1) finished pharmaceutical products and (2) Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, or API, products. The finished pharmaceutical products segment manufactures, markets and distributes BAQSIMI , Primatene MIST , epinephrine, glucagon, phytonadione, lidocaine, enoxaparin, naloxone, as well as various other critical and non-critical care drugs. The API segment manufactures and distributes Recombinant Human Insulin, or RHI API, and porcine insulin API for external customers and internal product development. Information reported herein is consistent with how it is reviewed and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker. Factors used to identify our segments include markets, customers and products.

 The increase in net revenues of the finished pharmaceutical products for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the following changes:

As a result, 40.4 million of our third quarter BAQSIMI sales were recognized separate from the cost of revenues, similar to our other products. During the third quarter of 2024, while the Company was transitioning from Lilly labeled product to Amphastar labeled product, our supplier was unable to supply Amphastar labeled product in 14 European countries on a timely basis, which limited sales by approximately 2.0 million to 3.0 million. For more information, see Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Revenue Recognition. Primatene MIST sales increased primarily due to an increase in unit volumes. The increase in sales of epinephrine was primarily due to sales of epinephrine pre-filled syringes in Canada, which we began this quarter. The increase in sales of phytonadione was primarily driven by an increase in unit volume, as a result of an increase in demand. The decrease in sales of glucagon was due to a decrease in unit volumes as a result of a move to ready to use glucagon products such as BAQSIMI , as well as a decrease in average selling price. The decrease in sales of enoxaparin and naloxone was primarily due to a decrease in unit volumes. The decrease in other finished pharmaceutical products was primarily due to lower unit sales of atropine and calcium chloride, as a result of other suppliers returning to their historical distribution levels. This decrease was partially offset by higher unit volumes of sodium bicarbonate due to an increase in capacity at our subsidiary, International Medication Systems, Limited, as well as the launch of albuterol in August 2024. Between 2.0 million and 4.0 million in sales expected to be recognized in the third quarter were not recognized due to delayed shipments caused by the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Revenues for these shipments are expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that sales of naloxone and enoxaparin will continue to fluctuate in the future due to competitive dynamics. We also anticipate that sales of epinephrine and other finished pharmaceutical products will continue to fluctuate depending on the ability of our competitors to supply market demands. Sales of API primarily depend on the timing of customer purchases, and will be lower for the next two years because MannKind, our largest RHI customer, is in the process of qualifying our upgraded RHI, which uses our internally produced inclusion bodies made at AFP. Until they complete this process, we anticipate sales of RHI will be at levels lower than historical.

 Other Revenues Other revenues include the portion of BAQSIMI sales made by Lilly on our behalf under the TSA which amounted to 2.4 million and 28.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, based on total BAQSIMI sales of 6.4 million and 48.7 million, respectively, as reported to us by Lilly, which was recognized on a net basis, similar to a royalty arrangement. The BAQSIMI sales made by Lilly on our behalf under the TSA have decreased throughout 2024, due to our assumption of distribution responsibilities for BAQSIMI from Lilly to our customers in the United States, and certain other countries. We recognized these sales within product net revenues. Backlog A significant portion of our customer shipments in any period relate to orders received and shipped in the same period, generally resulting in low product backlog relative to total shipments at any time. As of September 30, 2024, we experienced an immaterial amount of backlog for various products, primarily as a result of competitor shortages and supplier constraints. Historically, our backlog has not been a meaningful indicator in any given period of our ability to achieve any particular level of overall revenue or financial performance. Gross margins The decrease in gross margins during the three months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to an increase in labor costs and certain component costs, as well as charges included in cost of revenues to adjust our inventory and related purchase commitments to their net realizable value. As a result of the TSA with Lilly, the portion of revenues relating to BAQSIMI sales made by Lilly on our behalf are reported on a net basis, similar to a royalty arrangement with no amount reported as cost of revenues. Therefore, in the prior year, BAQSIMI sales did not have any associated cost of revenues, which increased the gross margins. The decrease in gross margins was partially offset by an increase in sales of Primatene MIST and epinephrine, which are higher-margin products. We are currently experiencing increased costs for labor as well as certain APIs and purchased components. However, we believe that this trend will be offset longer term by increased sales of our higher-margin products, including BAQSIMI , Primatene MIST , vasopressin, ganirelix, and albuterol, and new products we anticipate launching.

This was partially offset by a decrease in clinical trial expense, due to the timing of clinical trials. Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates including the cost of developing APIs. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in research and development to expand our product portfolio and grow our business. We expect that research and development expenses will increase on an annual basis due to increased clinical trials costs related to our insulin and inhalation product candidates. These expenditures will include costs of APIs developed internally as well as APIs purchased externally, the cost of purchasing reference listed drugs and the costs of performing the clinical trials. As we undertake new and challenging research and development projects, we anticipate that the associated costs will increase significantly over the next several quarters and years.

A change to Other income (expenses), net primarily as a result of foreign currency fluctuation, as well as mark-to-market adjustments relating to our interest rate swap contracts during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 The increase in net revenues of the finished pharmaceutical products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due to the following changes:

As a result, 85.1 million of our BAQSIMI sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are recognized separate from the cost of revenues, similar to our other products. For more information, see Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Revenue Recognition. The increase in sales of epinephrine was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes, as a result of an increase in demand caused by other supplier shortages. Primatene MIST sales increased primarily due to an increase in unit volumes. The decrease in sales of enoxaparin and naloxone was primarily due to a decrease in unit volumes. The decrease in other finished pharmaceutical products was primarily due to lower unit sales of atropine and calcium chloride, as a result of other suppliers returning to their historical distribution levels, as well as lower unit sales of medroxyprogesterone, as our API supplier discontinued making the active ingredient, which resulted in a halt of sales of medroxyprogesterone after the third quarter of 2023. Subsequently, we qualified our subsidiary, ANP, to manufacture this API, and in September 2024, we re-launched the product. This decrease was partially offset by higher unit volumes of dextrose and sodium bicarbonate due to an increase in demand caused by other supplier shortages, as well as the launch of albuterol in August 2024. We anticipate that sales of naloxone and enoxaparin will continue to fluctuate in the future due to competitive dynamics. We also anticipate that sales of epinephrine and other finished pharmaceutical products will continue to fluctuate depending on the ability of our competitors to supply market demands. Sales of API primarily depend on the timing of customer purchases, and will be lower for the next two years because MannKind, our largest RHI customer, is in the process of qualifying our upgraded Recombinant Human Insulin, or RHI, which uses our internally produced inclusion bodies made at AFP. Until they complete this process, we anticipate sales of RHI will be at levels lower than historical. Other Revenues Other revenues include the portion of BAQSIMI sales made by Lilly on our behalf under the TSA which amounted to 19.6 million and 28.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, based on total BAQSIMI sales of 38.6 million and 48.7 million, respectively, as reported to us by Lilly, which was recognized on a net basis, similar to a royalty arrangement. The BAQSIMI sales made by Lilly on our behalf under the TSA have

 decreased throughout 2024, due to our assumption of distribution responsibilities for BAQSIMI from Lilly to our customers in the United States, and certain other countries. We recognized these sales within product net revenues. Gross margins The decrease in gross margins during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to the acquired BAQSIMI assets, an increase in labor costs and certain component costs, as well as charges included in cost of revenues to adjust our inventory and related purchase commitments to their net realizable value. As a result of the TSA with Lilly, the portion of revenues relating to BAQSIMI sales made by Lilly on our behalf are reported on a net basis, similar to a royalty arrangement with no amount reported as cost of revenues.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements and Sources We need capital resources to maintain and expand our business. We expect our cash requirements to increase significantly in the foreseeable future as we sponsor clinical trials for, seek regulatory approvals of, and develop, manufacture and market our current development stage product candidates and pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses or assets. Our future capital expenditures include projects to upgrade, expand, and improve our manufacturing facilities in the United States and China, including a significant increase in capital expenditures over the next few years. We plan to fund this facility expansion primarily with cash flows from operations. We may also become subject to cash obligations of up to an aggregate of 575.0 million that are contingent upon certain net sales milestones related to the BAQSIMI acquisition. No milestone payments have been made through the date of this filing. Our cash obligations include the principal and interest payments due on our existing loans and lease payments, as described below and throughout this Quarterly Report. As of September 30, 2024, our foreign subsidiaries collectively held 9.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash or cash equivalents held at foreign subsidiaries are not available to fund the parent company s operations in the United States. We believe that our cash reserves, operating cash flows, and borrowing availability under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We expect additional cash flows to be generated in the longer term from future product introductions, although there can be no assurance as to the receipt of regulatory approval for any product candidates that we are developing or the timing of any product introductions, which could be lengthy or ultimately unsuccessful. Working capital increased 122.7 million to 386.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 264.2 million at December 31, 2023. Cash Flows from Operations The following table summarizes our cash flows used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities of 6.0 million, which resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivables, an increase in inventories, as well as an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, which was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increase in accounts receivables was primarily due to the increase in sales. The increase in inventories was primarily due to the increased purchases of certain raw materials and components. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased primarily due to the increase in accrued customer fees and rebates associated with BAQSIMI sales, as we continue to assume distribution responsibilities for BAQSIMI from Lilly to our customers in the United States and certain other countries. Net cash provided by operating activities was 159.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which included net income of 101.4 million. Non-cash items comprised primarily of 36.5 million of depreciation and amortization, 15.6 million of share-based compensation expense, and an impairment charge of 2.7 million relating to the impairment of the IMS (UK) international product rights. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there was a net cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities of 2.5 million, which resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivables and inventories. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased primarily due to the timing of payments. The increase in accounts receivables was primarily due to the timing of the payment from Lilly for BAQSIMI during the quarter, which was received subsequent to the quarter end. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was 89.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the payment of 129.0 million relating to the BAQSIMI acquisition, 28.6 million in purchases of property, plant, and equipment, which included 10.2 million incurred in the United States, 2.4 million in France, and 15.9 million in China. This was partially offset by a net cash inflow of 71.0 million from sales and purchases of investments during the period. Net cash used in investing activities was 546.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of 506.4 million relating to the BAQSIMI acquisition, 28.7 million in purchases of property, plant, and equipment, which included 19.5 million incurred in the United States, 1.7 million in France, and 7.5 million in China. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was 47.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of 43.5 million used to purchase treasury stock and 8.2 million used to settle share-based compensation awards under our equity plan and for tax payments related to the net share settlement of options exercised. Additionally, we made 8.1 million in principal payments on our long-term debt, primarily as a result of paying off the mortgage loan with East West Bank. This was partially offset by 13.6 million of net proceeds from borrowings on our line of credit in China. Net cash provided by financing activities was 501.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to our entry into the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo and the issuance of the 2029 Convertible Notes, which was partially offset by 268.5 million in principal payments of our long-term debt and 24.6 million in debt issuance cost. Additionally, we received 7.4 million in net proceeds from the settlement of share-based compensation awards under our equity plan, which was partially offset by the 58.4 million used to purchase treasury stock.

 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as compared to the critical accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, see Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Government Regulation Our products and facilities are subject to regulation by a number of federal and state governmental agencies. The FDA, in particular, maintains oversight of the formulation, manufacture, distribution, packaging, and labeling of all of our products. The Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, maintains oversight over our products that are considered controlled substances. From February 20 through March 1, 2024, our Amphastar facility in Rancho Cucamonga, California was subject to pre-approval and cGMP inspection by the FDA. The inspection included a review of compliance with FDA regulations to support one of our pending applications as well as to compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices. The inspection resulted in several observations on Form 483. We responded to those observations. We believe that our response to the observations will satisfy the requirements of the FDA and that no significant further actions will be necessary. From July 15 through July 19, 2024, our Armstrong facility in Canton, Massachusetts was subject to a pre-approval inspection by the FDA. The inspection included review of compliance of our analytical laboratory with FDA regulations to support one of our pending applications. The inspection resulted in several observations on Form 483. We responded to those observations. We believe that our response to the observations will satisfy the requirements of the FDA and that no significant further actions will be necessary.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Except for the broad, ongoing macroeconomic challenges facing the global economy and financial markets, there have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business. Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings. We are exposed to market risk for changes in the market values of our investments (Investment Risk), the impact of interest rate changes (Interest Rate Risk), and the impact of foreign currency exchange changes (Foreign Currency Exchange Risk). ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURE S Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, our principal executive and principal financial officers, respectively, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective (a) to ensure that information that we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (b) to include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management overriding of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

RISK FACTOR S Except as noted below, there were no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. The facilities we use for our headquarters, laboratory and research and development activities are located in earthquake-prone areas of California. A significant percentage of the facilities we use for our manufacturing, packaging, warehousing, distribution and administration offices are also located in these areas. Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, we currently rely on third parties whose operations may be disrupted by natural disasters. For example, the aftermath of Hurricane Helene caused us to experience delays in shipments of certain products. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us or the third parties upon whom we depend from using all or a significant portion of our facilities, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our or third parties manufacturing facilities, or that otherwise disrupted operations of ours or those of third parties, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Jack Y. Zhang and Mary Z. Luo have each pledged shares of our common stock to secure funds borrowed under existing credit lines from three financial institutions. Each of the lenders has varying rights as a lender, including one which has the right to conduct a forced sale at its sole discretion. An action by one of the lenders could include a sale of certain shares of our common stock pledged as collateral, the sale of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. An action to cure and cover indebtedness by any one of the lenders could also have other negative impacts on our business. Since September 2015, UBS Bank USA, or UBS, has made extensions of credit up to the amount of 8.0 million to Applied Physics Chemistry Laboratories, Inc., or APCL, which is controlled by Jack Y. Zhang and Mary Z. Luo. In May 2019, the credit amount was increased to 11.0 million. Since February 2017, UBS Group AG, or UBS AG, has also provided an extension of credit up to the amount of 8.0 million to APCL. In 2021, the outstanding UBS AG credit line was transferred to UBS s Utah location due to an organizational change and in June 2024, the credit line with UBS was increased to 11.9 million. As of September 30, 2024, the total outstanding UBS combined credit lines were 11.9 million. The UBS credit lines are secured by a pledge of 400,000 shares of our common stock currently held by APCL. Interest on the loans accrues at market rates. UBS has an unlimited and unilateral right to call each of the credit lines for any reason whatsoever. In October 2017, East West Bank, or East West, entered into an agreement with Drs. Zhang and Luo whereby East West would loan them up to 5.0 million. In March 2023, East West amended the loan to increase the loan amount to 8.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the loan is secured by a pledge of 500,000 shares of our common stock held by Dr. Zhang. Interest on the loan accrues at market rates. East West has acceleration rights to protect itself in the event of a default.

 In June 2024, Cathay Bank entered into an agreement with APCL and Dr. Luo, whereby Cathay Bank would loan them up to 20.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the loan is secured by a pledge of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock held by APCL and Dr. Luo. Interest on the loan accrues at market rates. Cathay Bank has acceleration rights to protect itself in the event of a default. We are not a party to these loans, which are full recourse against APCL and each of Drs. Zhang and Luo, respectively, and are secured by pledges of a portion of the shares of our common stock currently held by APCL and each of Drs. Zhang and Luo. In 2021, we created a pledging policy to restrict the pledging of shares by our executive officers and directors. The policy prohibits our executive officers and directors from entering into any transaction whereby the executive officer or director, directly or indirectly, pledges, hypothecates, or otherwise encumbers more than twenty (20) percent of shares of common stock held by the individual or more than five (5) percent of our total outstanding shares of common stock as of the date of the transaction, whichever is lower, as collateral for indebtedness. This restriction extends to any hedging or similar transaction designed to decrease the risks associated with holding our securities. For already existing pledges made by executive officers and directors, those existing pledges must be reduced to no more than twenty (20) percent of the shares of our common stock held by such individual as collateral for indebtedness within three (3) years of December 31, 2021. As a result of this policy, Drs. Zhang and Luo reduced their total number of pledged shares to 1,900,000 in June 2024 from 2,350,000 in May 2022, 3,182,898 in February 2022, and 8,582,898 in February 2021. If the price of our common stock declines, Drs. Zhang and Luo may be forced by these financial institutions to provide additional collateral for the loans or to sell shares of our common stock held by them in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of their loans. Furthermore, the pledged shares of our common stock may be acquired and sold by the lenders. These factors may limit Drs. Zhang and Luo s ability to either pledge additional shares of our common stock or sell shares of our common stock held by them as a means to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to their pledged shares of our common stock in the event of a decline in our stock price that is large enough to trigger a margin call. Any significant sales of shares of our common stock by one or more of these three lenders could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. ITEM 2.
