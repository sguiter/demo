NOTES REGARDING THE COMPANY 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

This

 anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, 
 intend, may, ongoing, plan, potential, predict, project, 
 should, will, would, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although
not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance or results
and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking
statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause our results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this report. 

Forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following: 

our
 possible or assumed future results of operations; 

our
 business strategies; 

our
 ability to attract and retain customers; 

our
 ability to sell additional products and services to customers;

 cash needs and financing plans; 

our
 competitive position; 

our
 industry environment; 

our
 potential growth opportunities; 

expected
 technological advances by us or by third parties and our ability to leverage them; 

Our
 inability to predict or anticipate the duration or long-term economic and business consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; 

the
 effects of future regulation; 

our
 ability to protect or monetize our intellectual property; 

changes
 in United States and China trade policies and relations, as well as relations with other countries, and/or changes in regulations

 impact on us from the actions the Chinese government may take to intervene in or influence our operations; 

the
 impact on us from the uncertainties in the Chinese legal system, such as Chinese regulations regarding acquisitions of companies
 based in mainland China by foreign investors and the ability of our Chinese subsidiaries to make payments to us; and

You
should read any other cautionary statements made in this report as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever
they appear in this report. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this report will prove to be accurate and therefore
prospective investors are encouraged not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. You should read this report completely.
Other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, even though our situation
may change in the future. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, except
as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 

Disclosures
Relating to Our Chinese Operations 

Clean
Energy Technologies Inc. is a company incorporated in the State of Nevada with operations in North America, Europe, and Asia, including
in China. Our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya, an entity in which we own a 49 equity interest, operate our natural gas trading operations
in China to source and supply natural gas to industries and municipalities located in China. Throughout this report, unless the context
requires otherwise, (i) the Company, we, us and our refer to Clean Energy Technologies,
Inc. on a consolidated basis with its wholly-owned subsidiaries; (ii) the PRC Subsidiaries refers specifically to those
wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours located in the People s Republic of China (including Hong Kong), which include Clean Energy Technologies
(H.K.) Limited, Meishan Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., Hainan Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., Element Capital International Limited
(H.K.), Sichuan Hunya Jieneng New Energy Co. LTD, and Jiangsu Huanya Jieneng New Energy Co., Ltd.; and (iii) Shuya refers
to Sichuan Hongzuo Shuya Energy Limited. 

We
face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties due to our operations in China. Our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya could be adversely
affected by uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system. Rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little advance
notice. The interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations involve additional uncertainties. Since administrative and
court authorities in China have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it
may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy. In addition,
the Chinese government exercises significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of the business of our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya
and may intervene in or influence their operations as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal
goals, which could result in a material change in their operations in China and/or the value of the securities we are registering for
sale, including causing the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. Furthermore, the Chinese government
has recently exerted more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and other capital markets activities and foreign investment
in China-based companies. Any such actions, once taken by the Chinese government, could significantly limit or completely hinder our
ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

Recently,
the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance
notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity
reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. We do not believe that we, our PRC Subsidiaries or Shuya are directly
subject to these regulatory actions or statements; however, because these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain
how soon legislative or administrative rule making bodies in China will respond to them, or what existing or new laws or regulations
will be modified or promulgated, if any, or the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on the daily business
operations or ability to accept foreign investments of our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya. On December 24, 2021, nine government agencies
jointly issued the Opinions on Promoting the Healthy and Sustainable Development of Platform Economy, which provides that, among others,
monopolistic agreements, abuse of dominant market position and illegal concentration of business operators in the field of platform economy
will be strictly investigated and punished in accordance with the relevant laws. Neither our PRC Subsidiaries nor Shuya hold a dominant
market position in their product markets and they have not entered into any monopolistic agreement. Neither have they received any inquiry
from the relevant governmental authorities. The Cyberspace Administration of China CAC ), together with 12 other Chinese
regulatory authorities, released the final version of the Revised Measures for Cybersecurity Review, or the Revised Cybersecurity Measures,
in December 2021, which took effect on February 15, 2022. Pursuant to the Revised Cybersecurity Measures, critical information infrastructure
operators procuring network products and services and online platform operators carrying out data processing activities, which affect
or may affect national security, shall conduct a cybersecurity review pursuant to the provisions therein. In addition, online platform
operators possessing personal information of more than one million users seeking to be listed on foreign stock markets must apply for
a cybersecurity review. On November 14, 2021, the CAC published the Draft Regulations on the Network Data Security Administration (Draft
for Comments) (the Security Administration Draft ), which provides that data processing operators engaging in data processing
activities that affect or may affect national security must be subject to cybersecurity review by the relevant Cyberspace Administration
of the PRC. We do not believe that our PRC Subsidiaries or Shuya are online platform operators within the meaning of the
Revised Cybersecurity Measures, and neither our PRC Subsidiaries nor Shuya currently possess over one million Chinese users personal
information and do not anticipate that they will be collecting over one million Chinese users personal information in the foreseeable
future. In addition, neither our PRC Subsidiaries nor Shuya will be subject to Security Administration Draft if the Security Administration
Draft is enacted as proposed, since they currently do not collect data that affects or may affect national security and we do not anticipate
that our PRC Subsidiaries or Shuya will be collecting data that affects or may affect national security in the foreseeable future.

On
February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of the Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic
Companies, or the Trial Measures, and the relevant five guidelines, which became effective on March 31, 2023. The Trial Measures comprehensively
reformed the existing regulatory regime for overseas offering and listing of PRC domestic companies securities and will regulate
both direct and indirect overseas offering and listing of PRC domestic companies securities by adopting a filing-based regulatory
regime. Pursuant to the Trial Measures, PRC domestic companies that seek to offer and list securities in overseas markets, either in
direct or indirect means, are required to fulfill the filing procedure with the CSRC and report relevant information. The Trial Measures
provides that if the issuer meets both of the following criteria, the overseas securities offering and listing conducted by such issuer
will be deemed as indirect overseas offering by PRC domestic companies: (i) 50 or more of any of the issuer s operating revenue,
total profit, total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal year
is accounted for by domestic companies; and (ii) the principal parts of the issuer s business activities are conducted in mainland
China, or its principal place(s) of business are located in mainland China, or the majority of senior management staff in charge of its
business operations and management are PRC citizens or have their usual place(s) of residence located in mainland China. If we ever are
required by the CSRC to submit and complete the filing procedures for our future offerings of our securities, we cannot assure you that
we will be able to complete such filings in a timely manner, or even at all, which could significantly limit or completely hinder our
ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become
worthless. Any failure by us to comply with such filing requirements under the Trial Measures may result in rectification, warnings,
and a fine between RMB 1 million and RMB 10 million on our PRC Subsidiaries or Shuya, which could adversely and materially affect our
business operations and financial outlook and could cause the value of our common stock to significantly decline or, in extreme cases,
become worthless. 

As
of the date of this report, these new laws and guidelines have not impacted the ability of our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya to conduct
business and accept foreign investments; however, if (i) we inadvertently conclude that permissions or approvals are not required from
applicable PRC authorities or (ii) applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change, and we are required to obtain such permissions
or approvals in the future, our ability to conduct our business in China may be materially impacted, the interest of the investors may
be materially and adversely affected and our common stock may significantly decrease in value. 

In
addition, we face risks associated with the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or HFCAA. Trading in our securities on U.S. markets,
including Nasdaq, may be prohibited under the HFCAA if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, determines that it is
unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditor for two consecutive years. Pursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a Determination
Report on December 16, 2021, which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms
headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong because of positions taken by the authorities in those jurisdictions. In addition, the
PCAOB s report identified the specific registered public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations. On August
26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol Agreement with the CSRC and the Ministry of Finance (the MOF of the
PRC governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based in China or Hong Kong. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced in
the 2022 Determination its determination that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate accounting firms
headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, and the PCAOB Board voted to vacate previous determinations to the contrary. Should the
PCAOB again encounter impediments to inspections and investigations in mainland China or Hong Kong as a result of positions taken by
any authority in either jurisdiction, including by the CSRC or the MOF, the PCAOB will make determinations under the HFCAA as and when
appropriate. Both our current auditor, TAAD LLP, and our former auditor, Fruci Associates II, PLLC, are headquartered in the United
States and, as PCAOB-registered public accounting firms, they are required to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its
compliance with the laws of the U.S. and professional standards. TAAD LLP and Fruci Associates II, PLLC have been subject to PCAOB
inspections and are not among the PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in the PRC or Hong Kong that are subject to
PCAOB s determination of having been unable to inspect or investigate completely. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is later
determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, if there is any regulatory change or step taken
by PRC regulators that does not permit our auditor to provide audit documentations located in China or Hong Kong to the PCAOB for inspection
or investigation, or the PCAOB expands the scope of the Determination so that we are subject to the HFCAA, as the same may be amended,
you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Any audit reports not issued by auditors that are completely inspected or investigated
by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our
auditors audits and their quality control procedures, could result in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and disclosures
are adequate and accurate, which could result in limitation or restriction to our access to the U.S. capital markets, and trading of
our securities, including trading on the national exchange and trading on over-the-counter markets, may be prohibited under
the HFCAA and our securities may be delisted by an exchange. 

Cash
may be transferred within our organization in the following manners: (i) Clean Energy Technologies Inc. may transfer funds to the PRC
Subsidiaries and Shuya by way of capital contributions or loans, through intermediate holding subsidiaries or otherwise, as investments
or lendings, (ii) the PRC Subsidiaries may make dividends or other distributions to Clean Energy Technologies Inc. through intermediate
holding companies or otherwise, and (iii) Shuya may make dividends or other distributions to Clean Energy Technologies Inc., which indirectly
owns a 49 equity interest in Shuya, through intermediate holding companies or otherwise. Our abilities to use cash held in PRC or in
a PRC entity to fund operations or for other purposes outside of the PRC are subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by the PRC
government. Current PRC regulations only permit a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, or WFOE, to pay dividends to its offshore parent company
out of their retained earnings, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, the
majority of the revenues of our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya are collected in RMB. Thus, foreign exchange shortages and foreign exchange
control may also limit their ability to pay dividends or make other payments or otherwise meet our obligations denominated in foreign
currencies. Furthermore, we may lose our ability to fund operations or for other uses outside of Hong Kong using cash in Hong Kong or
a Hong Kong entity if, in the future, the scope of the current restrictions and limitations applicable to PRC entities were to expand
to include Hong Kong or entities based in Hong Kong. Therefore, our ability to transfer cash between PRC entities and entities outside
of PRC may be restricted. As of the date of this report, (i) we have transferred 2,671,700 in total to our PRC Subsidiaries, and (ii)
JHJ, our wholly-owned subsidiary in the PRC, has transferred 701,836 in total to Shuya as a capital contribution for the formation of
Shuya. No other cash flows or transfers of other assets have occurred between us, our PRC Subsidiaries, and Shuya . As of the date
of this report, neither any of our PRC Subsidiaries nor Shuya has declared any dividends or made any other distributions to the Company,
and no such dividends or distributions are anticipated in the near future.

Going
Concern 

The financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The Company had a total stockholder s equity of and a working capital deficit of as of September
30, 2024. The company also had an accumulated deficit of as of September 30, 2024. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about
the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach
profitable operations and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate
positive cash flow from operations.

When
performing the two-step quantitative impairment test, the Company s methodology includes the use of an income approach which discounts
future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects the Company s cost of capital, otherwise known as the discounted
cash flow method DCF ). These estimated fair values are based on estimates of future cash flows of the businesses. Factors
affecting these future cash flows include the continued market acceptance of the products and services offered by the businesses, the
development of new products and services by the businesses and the underlying cost of development, the future cost structure of the businesses,
and future technological changes. The Company also incorporates market multiples for comparable companies in determining the fair value
of our reporting units. Any such impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified. 

impairment of long-lived assets for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023. 

An
entity transfers control of a good or service over time and satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one
of the following criteria is met: 

a.
The customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity s performance as the entity performs (as described in FASB
ASC 606-10-55-5 through 55-6). 

 b.
The entity s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is
created or enhanced (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-7). 

 c.
The entity s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see FASB ASC 606-10-25-28), and the entity
has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-25-29). 

Performance
Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time 

FASB
ASC 606-10-25-30 

If
a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. To determine the point
in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity should
consider the guidance on control in FASB ASC 606-10-25-23 through 25-26. In addition, it should consider indicators of the transfer of
control, which include, but are not limited to, the following: 

a.
The entity has a present right to payment for the asset 

 b.
The customer has legal title to the asset 

 c.
The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset 

 d.
The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset 

 e.
The customer has accepted the asset 

The
core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration
it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. In addition, a) the company also does not have
an alternative use for the asset if the customer were to cancel the contract, and b) has a fully enforceable right to receive payment
for work performed (i.e., customers are required to pay as various milestones and/or timeframes are met) 

The
following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our HRS and Cety Europe Divisions: 

Identify
 the contract with the customer 

Identify
 the performance obligations in the contract 

Determine
 the transaction price 

Allocate
 the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

Recognize
 revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation 

The
following steps are applied to our legacy engineering and manufacturing division: 

We
 generate a quotation 

We
 receive Purchase orders from our customers. 

We
 build the product to their specification 

We
 invoice at the time of shipment 

The
 terms are typically Net 30 days 

The
following step is applied to our CETY HK business unit: 

CETY
 HK is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract / promise to provide the specified good or service. 

A
principal obtains control over any one of the following (ASC 606-10-55-37A): 

a. 
 A
 good or another asset from the other party which the entity then transfers to the customer. Note that momentary control before transfer
 to the customer may not qualify. 

b. 
 A
 right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service
 to the customer on the entity s behalf. 

c. 
 A
 good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or service
 to the customer. 

If
the entity obtains control over one of the above before the good or service is transferred to a customer, the entity could be considered
a principal. 

Additionally,
the above five steps are applied to achieve core principle for our CETY Renewables Division: 

Because
the CETY Renewables division is presently engaged in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) of biomass power facilities,
CETY Renewables has developed a process of executing EPC Agreements with customers for this work. In contracting these engagements, CETY
Renewables recognizes revenue according to accounting standards in accordance with ASC 606. 

In
recognizing this revenue, CETY Renewables first identifies the relevant contract with its customer according to 606-10-25-1. 

The
 entities, together known as the Parties, approved the contract in writing, through signatures and commitment to the performance of
 permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning. 

CETY s
 work product includes permits, engineering designs, equipment, and full balance of plant specific to permitting, design, procurement,
 construction, and commissioning. 

CETY
 and customer agree to a total EPC contract price. 

The
 contract has commercial substance. The risk associated with this EPC Agreement is that payment of the EPC contract price. 

Per
 the EPC Agreement, CETY expects to collect substantially all of the consideration for its goods and services. 

Secondly,
CETY identifies the performance obligations of the Parties in performance of the EPC Agreement in accordance with 606-10-25-14. At contract
inception, CETY assesses the goods and services necessary to deliver the facility in accordance with its agreement with clients. The
agreement specifically laid out all deliverables necessary to achieve the permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning. 

CETY
also looks at 606-10-25-14(A). A bundle of goods or services is also present, in that CETY is delivering all work products associated
with permitting, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a commercially operable biomass power plant. A biomass power
plant is a distinct bundle of goods or services, so the individual goods or services on their own do not lend themselves to a fully integrated
or functional system. 

CETY
in accordance with 606-10-32-1, CETY reviews measurement of the performance obligations. There is no exclusion of any amount of the Contract
Price due to constraints associated with 606-10-31-11 through 606-10-32-13. 

In
review of 606-10-32-2A, CETY did not exclude measurement from the measurement of the transaction price any taxes assessed by a government
authority as no such taxes will be due. 

In
reviewing 606-10-32-3, CETY evaluated the nature, timing, and amount of consideration promised, and whether it impacts the estimate of
the transaction price. 

Finally,
in identifying a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time, in accordance with 606-10-25-32,
CETY applies the methodology of 606-10-25-36. CETY adopted and implemented the input method for revenue recognition in accordance with
ASC 606-10-25-33. The company adopts the input method for implementation. CETY recognizes revenue for performance obligations on the
basis of the entity s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation per 606-10-55-20. 

For
CETY, the contracts with clients for the construction of biomass power plants are the basis for revenue recognition. In each separate
EPC Agreement, the performance obligations include permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the plant. All
of these work products satisfy Section 606-10-25-27(b) as these work products create or enhance an asset under customer s control.
Upon delivery of the work product, the customer takes control of the work products and has full right and ability to direct the use of
and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the assets. We recognize revenue over time, using timeline and milestone methods
to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. 

During
the complexity and duration of the biomass power plant construction projects, CETY will recognize revenue over time, consistent with
the criteria for over-time recognition under ASC 606. This approach reflects the continuous transfer of documents, permits, and the equipment
over to the customer, which is characteristic of long-term construction contracts. 

We
have a list of appropriate measures of progress: This is based on milestones achieved, among other measures. 

Given
the long-term nature of the projects, CETY regularly reviews and, if necessary, updates its estimates of progress towards completion,
transaction price, and the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations. 

Also,
from time to time our contracts state that the customer is not obligated to pay a final payment until the units are commissioned, i.e.
a final payment of . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had and of deferred revenue, which is expected
to be recognized in the fourth quarter of year 2024. 

Also
from time to time we require upfront deposits from our customers based on the contract. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31,
2023, we had outstanding customer deposits of 
and 
respectively.

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash, prepaid expenses, inventory, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and convertible
notes payable. The estimated fair value of cash, prepaid expenses, investments, accounts payable, accrued expenses and convertible notes
payable approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments. 

million million) with
latest contribution due date in February 2066 into Sichuan Hongzuo Shuya Energy Limited Shuya ), JHK owns of Shuya.
In August 2022, JHJ purchased ownership of Sichuan Shunengwei Energy Technology Limited SSET for , who owns 
of Shuya; Shunengwei is a holding company and did not have any operations nor made any capital contribution into Shuya as of the ownership
purchase date by JHJ; right after the ownership purchase of SSET, JHJ ultimately owns of Shuya. 

Shuya
was set up as the operating entity for pipeline natural gas (PNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) trading business, while the other
two shareholders of Shuaya have large supply relationships. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has determined that Shuya was not a VIE and has evaluated its consolidation analysis under
the voting interest model. Because the Company does not own greater than 50 of the outstanding voting shares, either directly or indirectly,
it has accounted for its investment in Shuya under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investor JHJ recognizes its share of the profits and losses of the investee Shuya in the periods when these profits and losses are
also reflected in the accounts of the investee. Any profit or loss recognized by the investing entity appears in its income statement.
Also, any recognized profit increases the investment recorded by the investing entity, while a recognized loss decreases the investment. 

JHJ
made a investment of RMB million million) into Shuya during the 12 months ended December 31, 2022 recorded in accordance
with ASC 323. Shuya had a net loss of approximately during the year ending December 31, 2022, of which approximately was
allocated to the company, reducing the investment by that amount. 

However,
effective January 1, 2023, JHJ, SSET and Chengdu Xiangyueheng Enterprise Management Co., Ltd Xiangyueheng), who is the shareholder
of Shuya, entered a Three-Parties Consistent Action Agreement, wherein these three shareholders (or three parties) will guarantee that
the voting rights will be expressed in the same way at the shareholders meeting of Shuya to consolidate the controlling position
of the three parties in Shuya. The three parties agree that within the validity period of this agreement, before the party intends to
propose the motions to the shareholders or the board of directors on the major matters related to the voting rights of the shareholders
or the board of directors, the three parties internally will discuss, negotiate and coordinate the motion topics for consistency; in
the event of disagreement, the opinions of JHJ shall prevail. 

As
a result of Consistent Action Agreement, the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity VIE of JHJ because 1) the equity investors at risk, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and 2) Shuya
is structured with disproportionate voting rights, and substantially all of the activities are conducted on behalf of an investor with
disproportionately few voting rights. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate
that VIE, if the reporting entity has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly affect the VIE s economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits,
that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company concluded JHJ is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly,
the Company consolidates Shuya effective on January 1, 2023. 

The
change of control interest was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification,
referred to as ASC, 805, Business Combinations. The management determined that the Company was the acquiror for financial accounting
purposes. In identifying the Company as the accounting acquiror, the companies considered the structure of the transaction and other
actions contemplated by the Three-Parties Consistent Action Agreement, relative outstanding share ownership and market values, the composition
of the combined company s board of directors, the relative size of Shuya, and the designation of certain senior management positions
of the combined company. 

In
accordance with ASC 805, the Company recorded the acquisition based on the fair value of the consideration transferred and then allocated
the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as of the Acquisition
Date. The excess of the value of consideration transferred over the aggregate fair value of those net assets was recorded as goodwill.
Any identified definite lived intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives and any identified intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives and goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. All intangible assets
and goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of
future revenues and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The valuation of purchase considerations was based
on preliminary estimates that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. 

As
the Consistent Action Agreement did not quantify any considerations to gain the control, the deemed consideration paid is the fair value
of non-controlling interest as of January 1, 2023. The following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration paid and the
fair value of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed on January 1, 2023, the acquisition date.

Under
ASC-805-10-50-2, initial consolidation of an investee previously reported using fair value or the equity method should be accounted for
prospectively as of the date the entity obtained a controlling financial interest. Therefore, the Company should provide pro forma information
as if the consolidation had occurred as of the beginning of each of the current and prior comparative reporting period per 

On
January 1, 2024, and effective on the same date, JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted
Action Agreement (the Termination Agreement ), pursuant to which the parties released each other from any and all obligations
under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company analyzed
whether Shuya should be consolidated under ASC 810 and determined Shuya is no longer required to be consolidated on January 1, 2024 after
the execution of the Termination Agreement. Accordingly, the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements
on or after January 1, 2024.

re-evaluate the assumptions used to value our share-based awards on a quarterly basis and, if changes warrant different assumptions,
the share-based compensation expense could vary significantly from the amount expensed in the past. We may be required to adjust any
remaining share-based compensation expense, based on any additions, cancellations or adjustments to the share-based awards. The expense
is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service
period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the
requisite service. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we had and in share-based expense, respectively.
As of September 30, 2024 we had no further non-vested expense to be recognized.

Income
taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to ASC 740-10-25 Income Taxes Recognition. Under
this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis
of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred
tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the more likely than not standard required by ASC 740-10-25-5. 

Deferred
income tax amounts reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes. 

As
of December 31, 2023, we had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately and a deferred tax asset of 
using the statutory rate of . The deferred tax asset may be recognized in future periods, not to exceed 20 years. However, due to
the uncertainty of future events we have booked a valuation allowance of ). FASB ASC 740 prescribes recognition threshold
and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure and transition. On September 30, 2024 the Company did not take any tax positions that would require disclosure under FASB
ASC 740.

The

a Variable Interest Entity VIE ). The Joint Venture qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient
equity to operate without financial support from both parties. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE
when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling
financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates
a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 49/51 and the
agreement provides for a Management Committee of 3 members. Two of the three members are from Synergy Bioproducts Corporation, and one
is from CETY. Both parties do not have substantial capital at risk and CETY does not have voting interest. However, SBC has controlling
interest and more board votes therefore SBC is the beneficiary of the VIE and as a result we record it as an equity investment. Accordingly,
the Company has elected to account for the joint venture as an equity method investment in accordance with ASC 323 Investments 
Equity Method and Joint Ventures. This decision is a result of the company s evaluation of its involvement with potential variable
interest entities and their respective risk and reward scenarios, which collectively affirm that the conditions necessitating the application
of the variable interest model are not present.

Overview 

General 

The
Company s business and operating results are directly affected by changes in overall customer demand, operational costs and performance
and leverage of our fixed cost and selling, general and administrative SG A infrastructure. 

Product
sales fluctuate in response to several factors including many that are beyond the Company s control, such as general economic conditions,
interest rates, government regulations, consumer spending, labor availability, and our customers production rates and inventory
levels. Product sales consist of demand from customers in many different markets with different levels of cyclicality and seasonality. 

Operating
performance is dependent on the Company s ability to manage changes in input costs for items such as raw materials, labor, and
overhead operating costs. Performance is also affected by manufacturing efficiencies, including items such as on time delivery, quality,
scrap, and productivity. Market factors of supply and demand can impact operating costs.

Summary
of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Same Period in 2023 

Going
Concern 

The
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets
and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a negative working capital of 778,464 as of
September 30, 2024, The company also had an accumulated deficit of 26,643,673 as of September 30, 2024 and used 2,788,608 in net
cash from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach
profitable operations and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to
generate positive cash flow from operations. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total revenue was 1,944,333 compared to 5,278,203 for the same period in 2023. Our revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the same period in 2023 due to deconsolidation of the China operations. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profit was 641,575 compared to 992,943 for the same period in 2023. The decrease
in gross profit margin was due to lower revenue from China operations. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating expense was 3,193,447 compared to 2,463,090 for the same period in 2023. The
increase in expenses was due to higher salaries expenses, professional fees for legal accounting, for stock compensation for loan inducements. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 3,550,669 compared to net loss of 2,460,489 for the same period in 2023
due to increase in salaries fir the CETY Renewable engineering Team, professional fees for legal, accounting, IR, and stock
compensation. 

For
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, stockholder s equity was 3,583,444, compared to 5,869,198 as of September 30, 2023. This decrease
in stockholder s equity can be attributed to loss of revenue from China operations and lower profits, 

CETY
has successfully repositioned itself and created 4 different business segments to create a larger, more stable, and more diversified
revenue stream that could scale up. The 4 segments are Clean Energy HRS (Heat Recovery), Waste-to-Energy (Pyrolysis Plant), Engineering
and manufacturing services, and CETY HK (NG trading and acquisitions). Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly
contributed by NG trading and waste to energy project. CETY expects larger revenue contribution from Waste-to-Energy, Heat Recovery, and EPC next year which are higher gross margin segments. Our pilot Waste-to-Energy plant in Vermont which integrates all of CETY s
technologies and expertise into a single solution, is progressing steadily with delays related to permitting. There is a growing market for Heat
Recovery in the U.S. and Europe, and CETY HK has begun cross-selling Heat Recovery products in China. CETY is also gearing up for the
EPC segment to implement holistic self-generation solutions globally. 

45 

Management
believes this 4-segment strategy has created many operational synergies and cross-selling opportunities across different markets. The
growth in the year ended in 2023 was a result of this strategy. CETY believes that it will continue to deliver growth on all segments
due to our belief that there is an optimistic industry macro backdrop. The main macro factor benefiting us is the global commitment
to push renewable energy to the forefront from governments across the world. This is evidenced by the Paris Agreement and COP26. The
Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress in August 2022 had specific provisions that can take advantage of CETY s products and
solutions. Another catalyst that will potentially help our Company, is a continuously improving global supply chain. The European energy
crisis has given rise to the opportunity for CETY to sell more of its products and solutions as customers are in search of self-generation
capabilities in renewable energy. 

CETY
expects to and will continue to execute its corporate strategy to build sustained and profitable growth by providing end to end fully
integrated solutions and technologies, expand our global sales and marketing, production, research development, as well as search
for synergistic acquisition opportunities.

Results
of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
Sales 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total revenue was 1,944,333 compared to 5,278,203 for the same period in 2023. The decrease
in revenue was primarily due to deconsolidation of our China subsidiary. 

Segment
breakdown 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue from Engineering and Manufacturing was 0 compared to 59,877 for the
same period in 2023. Our engineering team has been
working on the Vermont project, additionally, some of our engineering revenue is rolled up into our
waste heat to power. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue from HRS was 158,830 compared to 399,136 for the same period in 2023. We
have a large pipeline of opportunities in this segment and are working diligently to complete the engineering and design, enabling us
to execute contractual agreements and close these opportunities. The sales cycle for these types of opportunities is long due to cost
factors and the integration of the technology. We are also working with financial institutions to assist in financing the projects as
we increasingly move towards Independent Power Producer models. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue from our waste to energy segment was 231,679 compared to 779,720 for the
same period in 2023. We have a large 12M contract with Vermont Renewable Gas in this segment and are currently finalizing the certificate of public good permitting to start the construction. We anticipate exponentially higher revenue driven from this segment. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue from our natural gas (NG) business amounted to 1,185,178, down from
 10,462,385 for the corresponding period in 2023. This decrease can be attributed to the deconsolidation of Shuya s revenue,
overall substantial lower revenue from China operations due to slow down in economy and our strategic decision to prioritize
non-Chinese markets over expansion into the ASEAN region. 

Gross
Profit 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profits totaled 641,575, marking higher margins compared to 992,943 recorded
for the corresponding period in 2023. This lower gross profit can be attributed to higher revenue and margins from non-Chinese NG
business. 

46 

Segment
breakdown 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profit from Engineering and Manufacturing amounted to 0, compared to 16,528
for the same period in 2023. This segment is a recent addition to CETY s portfolio, currently serving as a support for our ongoing
internal projects. Nevertheless, it is anticipated to expand notably as CETY shifts its focus towards providing comprehensive end-to-end
integrated solutions. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profit from HRS was 96,961 compared to 148,706 for the corresponding period in
2023. This increase in margins primarily stemmed from increased service activities, which did not include equipment
sales. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profit from waste to energy was 549,947, compared to 738,243 for the
corresponding period in 2023. Our waste to energy segment will be driving higher margins than our other segments. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profit from our wholly owned subsidiary, JHJ, was 0, a decrease from 524,152
recorded for the corresponding period in 2023. It s worth noting that our NG business typically operates on slim margins. Looking
ahead, we intend to leverage our presence in China to foster synergistic partnerships and facilitate technology transfers, particularly
in the growing EV charging sector. Additionally, we aim to explore cross-selling opportunities for our waste heat recovery and waste-to-energy
products within the Chinese market. 

Selling,
General and Administrative (SG A) Expenses 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our SG A expenses totaled 3,193,447, an increase from 2,463,090 for the same period
in 2023. This increase can be attributed to higher expenses from higher salaries from our Newley formed CETY Renewables,
professional fees legal accounting, and stock compensation for loan inducement. 

Salaries
Expense 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Salaries expense totaled 1,481,316, marking an increase from 957,759 recorded during
the same period in 2023. This increase in expenses can be attributed to the inclusion of key personnel such as our CFO, director of
operations, director of technology, and the recruitment of four additional engineers for CETY Renewables, and increased in work
force in our NG operations. Our strategy involves fortifying our team from the ground up to establish a robust foundation for
scalable growth, reinforced by cutting-edge technology and streamlined systems. We hold strong conviction in the capabilities of our
assembled team, envisioning their collective efforts leading us to a position of leadership within the clean energy
sector. 

Travel
Expense 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our travel expense was 135,964 compared to 326,905 for the same period in 2023. The
decrease was due to less business travels in our China subsidiaries. 

Professional
fees legal and accounting 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Professional Fees expense totaled 484,990, marking an increase from 259,476 in the
corresponding period of 2023. This rise in accounting fees can be attributed directly to engaging a new audit firm, which incurred
higher costs. 

Facility
Lease and Maintenance Expense 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our facility lease and maintenance expenses totaled 230,798, marking a significant
decrease from the 253,041 incurred during the same period in 2023. This decrease in cost can be attributed to relocating our Heat
Recovery Solutions and headquarters to a lower cost facility. 

Consulting 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our consulting expense was 195,640 compared to 244,540 for the same period
in 2023. The decrease was due to less market awareness and IR activities. 

Depreciation
and Amortization Expense 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our depreciation and amortization expense was 8,907 compared to 9,436 for the same
period in 2023. 

47 

Change
in Derivative Liability 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had 0 derivative liability compared to a gain of 326,539 for the same period in 2023.
The gain in derivative liability was from a favorable derivative calculation from several convertible notes in the three months ended
March 31, 2023. 

Interest
and Finance Fees 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest and finance fees amounted to 902,002, as opposed to 1,707,690 for the
corresponding period in 2023. The decrease in interest and fees can be attributed to lower amount of borrowing. Despite the decrease
in interest and fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we believe that the cost of capital for CETY remains elevated.
The delay in securing affordable financing for our Vermont project resulted in our reliance on high-cost financing options. We are
working diligently to finalize our financing in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

Net
Loss 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our loss amounted to 3,550,669, representing an increase from the loss of 2,460,489
incurred during the corresponding period in 2023. This increase is attributed to lower revenues and higher SG A
expenses.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. 

48 

We
regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these
policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management s estimates are based on historical experience,
on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and
circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ASC
606 ). 

Performance
Obligations Satisfied Over Time 

FASB
ASC 606-10-25-27 through 25-29, 25-36 through 25-37, 55-5 through 55-10 

An
entity transfers control of a good or service over time and satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one
of the following criteria is met: 

a.
The customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity s performance as the entity performs (as described in FASB
ASC 606-10-55-5 through 55-6). 

 b.
The entity s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is
created or enhanced (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-7). 

 c.
The entity s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see FASB ASC 606-10-25-28), and the entity
has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-25-29). 

The
following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our business: 

Identify
 the contract with the customer 

Identify
 the performance obligations in the contract 

Determine
 the transaction price 

Allocate
 the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

Recognize
 revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation 

Performance
Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time 

FASB
ASC 606-10-25-30 

If
a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. To determine the point
in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity should
consider the guidance on control in FASB ASC 606-10-25-23 through 25-26. In addition, it should consider indicators of the transfer of
control, which include, but are not limited to, the following: 

a.
The entity has a present right to payment for the asset 

 b.
The customer has legal title to the asset 

 c.
The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset 

 d.
The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset 

 e.
The customer has accepted the asset 

49 

The
core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration
it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. In addition a) the company also does not have an
alternative use for the asset if the customer were to cancel the contract, and b) has a fully enforceable right to receive payment for
work performed (i.e., customers are required to pay as various milestones and/or timeframes are met) 

The
following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our HRS and CETY Europe Divisions: 

Identify
 the contract with the customer 

Identify
 the performance obligations in the contract 

Determine
 the transaction price 

Allocate
 the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

Recognize
 revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation 

The
following steps are applied to our legacy engineering and manufacturing division: 

We
 generate a quotation 

We
 receive Purchase orders from our customers. 

We
 build the product to their specification 

We
 invoice at the time of shipment 

The
 terms are typically Net 30 days 

The
following step is applied to our CETY HK business unit: 

CETY
 HK is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract / promise to provide the specified good or service. 

A
principal obtains control over any one of the following (ASC 606-10-55-37A): 

a. 
 A
 good or another asset from the other party which the entity then transfers to the customer. Note that momentary control before transfer
 to the customer may not qualify. 

b. 
 A
 right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service
 to the customer on the entity s behalf. 

c. 
 A
 good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or service
 to the customer. 

If
the entity obtains control over one of the above before the good or service is transferred to a customer, the entity could be considered
a principal. 

During
the project development and engineering phase of our CETY Renewable projects such as VRG, we employ the input method of revenue recognition
to estimate revenue based on projected costs. This approach involves forecasting future costs and revenues to determine the amount of
revenue we recognize in the current period. It s important to understand, however, that these recognized revenue figures are not
final and are subject to adjustments. Changes may occur as we gain more clarity on actual costs compared to our initial projections,
affecting the revenue recognized accordingly. 

50 

The
projected costs of the VRG project is based on estimates and profitability will be impacted depending on actual costs. Using the input
method for revenue recognition, the amount of recorded revenue is also affected depending on the estimated total costs. The purchase
price allocation for Shuya was also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company. The inputs for the valuation of the
Series E preferred shares were also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company. 

Additionally,
the above five steps are applied to achieve core principle for our CETY Renewables Division: 

Because
the CETY Renewables division is presently engaged in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) of biomass power facilities,
CETY Renewables has developed a process of executing EPC Agreements with customers for this work. In contracting these engagements, CETY
Renewables recognizes revenue according to accounting standards in accordance with ASC 606. 

In
recognizing this revenue, CETY Renewables first identifies the relevant contract with its customer according to 606-10-25-1. 

The
 entities, together known as the Parties, approved the contract in writing, through signatures and commitment to the performance of
 permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning. 

CETY s
 work product includes permits, engineering designs, equipment, and full balance of plant specific to permitting, design, procurement,
 construction, and commissioning. 

CETY
 and customer agree to a total EPC Contract price. 

The
 contract has commercial substance. The risk associated with this EPC Agreement is that payment of the EPC contract price. 

Per
 the EPC Agreement, CETY expects to collect substantially all of the consideration for its goods and services. 

Secondly,
CETY identifies the performance obligations of the Parties in performance of the EPC Agreement in accordance with 606-10-25-14. At contract
inception, CETY assesses the goods and services necessary to deliver the facility in accordance with the its agreement with its clients.
The agreement specifically laid out all deliverables necessary to achieve the permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning. 

CETY
also looks at 606-10-25-14(A). A bundle of goods or services is also present, in that CETY is delivering all work products associated
with permitting, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a commercially operable biomass power plant. A biomass power
plant is a distinct bundle of goods or services, so the individual goods or services on their own do not lend themselves to a fully integrated
or functional system. 

CETY
in accordance with 606-10-32-1, CETY reviews measurement of the performance obligations. There are no exclusion of any amount of the
Contract Price due to constraints associated with 606-10-31-11 through 606-10-32-13. 

In
review of 606-10-32-2A, CETY did not exclude measurement from the measurement of the transaction price any taxes assessed by a government
authority as no such taxes will be due. 

In
reviewing 606-10-32-3, CETY evaluated the nature, timing, and amount of consideration promised, and whether it impacts the estimate of
the transaction price. 

Finally,
in identifying a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time, in accordance with 606-10-25-32,
CETY applies the methodology of 606-10-25-36. CETY adopted and implemented the input method for revenue recognition in accordance with
ASC 606-10-25-33. The company adopts the input method for implementation. CETY recognizes revenue for performance obligations on the
basis of the entity s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation per 606-10-55-20. 

51 

For
CETY, the contracts with clients for the construction of biomass power plants are the basis for revenue recognition. In each separate
EPC Agreement, the performance obligations include permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the plant. All
of these work products satisfy Section 606-10-25-27(b) as these work products create or enhance an asset under customer s control.
Upon delivery of the work product, the customer takes control of the work products and has full right and ability to direct the use of
and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the assets. We recognize revenue over time, using timeline and milestone methods
to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. 

During
the complexity and duration of the biomass power plant construction projects, CETY will recognize revenue over time, consistent with
the criteria for over-time recognition under ASC 606. This approach reflects the continuous transfer of documents, permits, and the equipment
over to the customer, which is characteristic of long-term construction contracts. 

We
have a list of appropriate measures of progress: This is based on milestones achieved, among other measures. 

Given
the long-term nature of the projects, CETY regularly reviews and, if necessary, updates its estimates of progress towards completion,
transaction price, and the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations. 

Also,
from time to time our contracts state that the customer is not obligated to pay a final payment until the units are commissioned, i.e.
a final payment of 10 . As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 33,000 and 33,000 of deferred revenue, which is expected
to be recognized in the fourth quarter of year 2024. 

Also
from time to time we require upfront deposits from our customers based on the contract. As of September 30,2024, and December 31, 2023, we
had outstanding customer deposits of 41,462 and 210,310 respectively. 

Change
from fair value or equity method to consolidation 

Chengdu
Xiangyueheng Enterprise Management Co., Ltd (the Xiangyueheng ), which owns a 10 equity interest in Shuya, entered a three-party
Concerted Action Agreement (the CAA ), wherein the parties agreed to vote in unison at the shareholders meeting of
Shuya to consolidate the controlling position of the three parties in Shuya. The three parties agreed that during the term of the CAA,
before any of the three parties intends to propose motions to the shareholders meetings or the board of directors, or exercise
their voting rights on any matter that shall be presented to and resolved through the shareholders meeting in accordance with
the laws, regulations, Articles of Association of Shuya or any relevant shareholders agreements, the three parties will discuss,
negotiate, and coordinate the motion topics for consistency; in the event of disagreement, the opinions of JHJ shall prevail. 

As
a result of the CAA, the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (the VIE of JHJ
because 1) the equity investors at risk, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and 2) Shuya is structured
with disproportionate voting rights, and substantially all the activities are conducted on behalf of an investor with disproportionately
few voting rights. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if
the reporting entity has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly
affect the VIE s economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially
be significant to the VIE. The Company concluded JHJ is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, the Company consolidates
Shuya into its consolidated financial statements effective on January 1, 2023. 

On
January 1, 2024, and effective on the same date, JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted
Action Agreement (the Termination Agreement ), pursuant to which the parties released each other from any and all obligations
under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50 of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company analyzed
whether Shuya should be consolidated under ASC 810 and determined Shuya is no longer required to be consolidated on January 1, 2024 after
the execution of the Termination Agreement. Accordingly, the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements
on or after January 1, 2024.

Series
E Valuation 

Additionally,
the inputs for the valuation of the Series E preferred shares were also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company
and fair value measurements, furthermore, the purchase price allocation was based on estimates of fair market values. 

Future
Financing 

We
will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares to continue to fund our business operations. Issuance of additional shares
will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities
or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and exploration activities. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material to stockholders. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB or other standard
setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently
issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
upon adoption. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information
under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the
participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange
Act ). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weaknesses resulting from the Board of Directors
not currently having any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii)
of Regulation S-K, and controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our
financial statements. Please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on April 17, 2024, for a complete discussion
relating to the foregoing evaluation of Disclosures and Procedures. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management has also evaluated our internal control over financial reporting, and there have been no significant changes during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to
the date of our last evaluation.
