Each reportable segment also represents a reporting unit. There were no events or changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred during the third quarter of 2024 . The Company will continue to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level. If the operating results of the Company s reporting units deteriorate in the future, it may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in goodwill impairment charges.

 and for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 , respectively, and for both the third quarter and year-to-date 2023. For the third quarter of 2024, the Company s effective tax rate was driven by the result of ongoing business activities rather than adjustments for discrete items. For year-to-date 2024, the Company s effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the recognition of a tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation awards year-to-date and the settlement of an uncertain tax position for less than the reserve in the first quarter, partially offset by additional uncertain tax positions in the second quarter. These factors, along with the impact of state taxes and the mix of income and losses across U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, caused the Company s effective tax rates for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 to differ from the statutory rate of . For the third quarter and year-to-date 2023, the Company s effective tax rates were primarily impacted by the recognition of a tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation awards. Changes in pretax income projections and the mix of income across jurisdictions could impact the effective tax rates in future quarters. The Company continues to have a U.S. valuation allowance for certain U.S. federal credits and state tax attributes, which relates to deferred tax assets that require certain types of income or for income to be earned in certain jurisdictions in order to be realized. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets in the U.S. and remaining foreign jurisdictions in future periods. Changes in pretax income projections could impact this evaluation in future periods. The Company files a U.S. federal income tax return and other income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state and local income tax examinations for years prior to 2021 and 2014, respectively. The acquired OfficeMax U.S. consolidated group is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examination, and with few exceptions, is no longer subject to U.S. state and local income tax examinations for years prior to 2013. Generally, the Company is subject to routine examination for years 2013 and forward in its international tax jurisdictions. It is anticipated that million of tax positions will be resolved within the next 12 months. Additionally, the Company anticipates that it is reasonably possible that new issues will be raised or resolved by tax authorities that may require changes to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits; however, an estimate of such changes cannot be reasonably made at this time.

As provided by the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement, available amounts that can be borrowed at any given time are based on percentages of certain outstanding accounts receivable, credit card receivables, inventory, and the cash value of company-owned life insurance policies. Year-to-date 2024, the Company elected to draw down million from its credit facilities under the Third and Fourth Amended Credit Agreements for working capital management. Of this amount, million was repaid year-to-date 2024 , resulting in million of revolving loans outstanding under the New Facility at September 28, 2024.

The Company has a frozen defined benefit pension plan in the UK. In July 2023, in accordance with applicable UK pension regulations, Trustees of the UK pension plan entered into an agreement with an insurer for the bulk annuity purchase of the plan, covering of the plan s members. This agreement, or buy-in, resulted in an exchange of plan assets for an annuity that covers the plan s future projected benefit obligations. The Company anticipates the buyout of the plan and transfer of future benefit obligations of plan participants to be completed with existing plan funds in 2025. Accordingly, the Company does not expect the transaction to result in material cash inflows or outflows. At the completion of the buy-out, the Company will remove the assets and liabilities of the UK pension plan from its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and a final non-cash plan settlement loss will be included in net periodic pension cost. The UK pension plan is in a net asset position and included in Other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 28, 2024 . There was net funded amount as of December 30, 2023. Year-to-date 2024 , cash contributions of million were made to the UK pension plan.

 million and million, respectively. Of these asset impairment charges, million and million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, related to the impairment of operating lease right-of-use ROU assets associated with the Company s retail store locations, with the remainder relating to impairment of fixed assets in year-to-date 2024. In the third quarter and year-to-date 2023 , the Company recognized asset impairment charges of million and million, respectively. Of these asset impairment charges, million and million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2023, respectively, was related to the impairment of operating lease ROU assets associated with the Company s retail store locations, with the remainder relating to impairment of fixed assets and other assets. All impairment charges discussed in the sections below are presented in Asset impairments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company regularly reviews retail store assets for impairment indicators at the individual store level, as this represents the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indicators of impairment are present, a recoverability analysis is performed which considers the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the retail store s remaining life and uses input from retail operations and accounting and finance personnel. These inputs include management s best estimates of retail store-level sales, gross margins, direct expenses, exercise of future lease renewal options when reasonably certain to be exercised, and resulting cash flows that can naturally include judgments about how current initiatives will impact future performance. The assumptions used within the recoverability analysis for the retail stores were updated to consider current quarter retail store operational results and formal plans for future retail store closures as part of the Company s restructuring programs, including the probability of closure at the retail store level. While it is generally understood that closures will approximate the store s lease termination date, it is possible that changes in store performance or other conditions could result in future changes in assumptions utilized. These assumptions reflected declining sales over the forecast period, and gross margin and operating cost assumptions that are consistent with recent actual results and consider plans for future initiatives. If the undiscounted cash flows of a retail store cannot support the carrying amount of its assets, the assets are impaired if necessary and written down to estimated fair value. The fair value of retail store assets is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis which uses Level 2 unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as independent real estate valuation opinions. Specifically, the analysis uses assumptions of potential rental rates for each retail store location which are based on market data for comparable locations. These estimated cash flows used in the third quarter of 2024 impairment calculation were discounted at a weighted average discount rate of . The Company will continue to evaluate initiatives to improve performance and lower operating costs. There are uncertainties regarding the impact of supply chain and macroeconomic conditions on the future results of operations, including the forecast period used in the recoverability analysis. To the extent that forward-looking sales and operating assumptions are not achieved and are subsequently reduced, additional impairment charges may result. However, at the end of the third quarter of 2024, the impairment recognized reflects the Company s best estimate of future performance.

 million as of September 28, 2024 , consisting of million related to the Varis Division and million in land . OTHER FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, trade accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. 

Financial liabilities: 

Long-term debt: 

New Facilities loans under the Third Amended Credit Agreement, due 

New Facility loan under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement, due 

Revenue bonds, due in varying amounts periodically through 

American Foreign Power Company, Inc. debentures, due 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments: Company-owned life insurance : In connection with the 2013 OfficeMax merger, the Company acquired company-owned life insurance policies on certain former employees. The fair value of the company-owned life insurance policies is derived using determinable net cash surrender value, which is the cash surrender value less any outstanding loans (Level 2 measure). Death benefits received on company-owned life insurance policies, which are tax-free at payout, typically exceed their cash surrender values. 

 Long-term debt : Long-term debt, for which there were no transactions on the measurement date, was valued based on quoted market prices near the measurement date when available or by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument using rates based on the most recently observable trade or using rates currently offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities (Level 2 measure). The carrying amount of the New Facility loan under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement approximates fair value because the interest rates vary with market interest rates. Refer to Note 7 for additional information about the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement.

after the sale. Under the terms of the related stock purchase agreement, the Company will fund up to million of expenses that may be incurred by Varis following the transaction date until December 31, 2025, and has no further obligations to contribute capital to Varis. The terms of sale did not result in a materially different impact than previously estimated on the Company s financial statements. The Company will deconsolidate its Varis Division effective October 18, 2024 by removing the associated assets and liabilities held for sale on its balance sheet. The Company will account for its retained minority interest of in Varis as an equity method investment going forward. The Company incurred an million non-cash loss from classification to held for sale related to the Varis Division year-to-date 2024, which was measured at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell and is included in the valuation allowance of the current assets held for sale. Of this amount, million was incurred in the second quarter of 2024, the period in which the Varis Division was classified as held for sale, and the remaining million was incurred in the third quarter of 2024. Also, restructuring expenses incurred by the Varis Division, which were previously presented as Corporate expenses, are included in the measurement and presentation of discontinued operations for all periods presented.

 OVERVIEW 
 THE COMPANY 
 We are a leading provider of products, services and technology solutions through an integrated business-to-business B2B distribution platform and omni-channel presence, which includes supply chain and distribution operations, dedicated sales professionals, online presence, and a network of Office Depot and OfficeMax retail stores. Through our operating companies ODP Business Solutions, LLC; Office Depot, LLC; and Veyer, LLC, we empower every business, professional, and consumer to achieve more every day. 
 As of September 28, 2024, our operations are organized into three reportable segments (or Divisions ), as described below. Our Varis Division, which is our tech-enabled B2B indirect procurement marketplace, has been held for sale and is being presented as discontinued operations beginning in the second quarter of 2024. The Varis Division was subsequently sold on October 18, 2024. Refer to the Recent Developments section below. 
 ODP Business Solutions Division Our leading B2B distribution solutions provider serving small, medium, and enterprise level companies, including those in the public and education sectors. This segment operates in the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada. The ODP Business Solutions Division sells nationally branded, as well as our private branded, office supply and adjacency products and services to customers, who are served through a dedicated sales force, catalogs, telesales, and electronically through our Internet websites. Adjacency products and services include cleaning, janitorial and breakroom supplies, office furniture, technology products, and copy and print services. This segment also includes our Federation entities, which are over 20 regional office supply distribution businesses acquired by us as part of our transformation to expand our reach and distribution network into geographic areas that were previously underserved, and which continue to operate under their own brand names. The acquisition of these businesses has allowed for an effective and accretive means to expand our distribution reach, target new business customers, and grow our offerings beyond traditional office supplies. 
 Office Depot Division Our leading provider of retail consumer and small business products and services distributed through a fully integrated omni-channel platform of 885 Office Depot and OfficeMax retail locations in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and an eCommerce presence (www.officedepot.com). Our Office Depot Division sells office supplies, technology products and solutions, business machines and related supplies, cleaning, breakroom and facilities products, personal protective equipment, and office furniture as well as offering business services including copying, printing, digital imaging, mailing, shipping, and technology support services. In addition, the print needs for retail and business customers are facilitated through our regional print production centers. 
 22 

Veyer Division Our supply chain, distribution, procurement and global sourcing operation, which specializes in B2B and consumer business service delivery, with core competencies in distribution, fulfillment, transportation, global sourcing, and purchasing. The Veyer Division s customers include our Office Depot Division and ODP Business Solutions Division, as well as third-party customers. The Veyer Division also includes the Company s global sourcing operations in Asia. 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 Acquisitions 
 Since 2017, we have been acquiring profitable regional office supply distribution businesses to expand our reach and distribution network into geographic areas that were previously underserved. During the third quarter of 2024, we acquired a small independent regional office supply distribution business in Canada. There have not been any other acquisitions year-to-date 2024. Our strategy has been to acquire businesses with purchase prices ranging generally from 5 million to 15 million, which were individually insignificant to us. The business acquired was consistent with acquisitions of similar sized businesses in the past and the acquisition was primarily funded with cash on hand. The operating results of this small office supply business is combined with our operating results subsequent to its purchase date, and is included in our ODP Business Solutions Division segment. Refer to Note 2. Acquisitions in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Disposition of our Varis Division 
 On April 24, 2024, our Board of Directors approved management s commitment to a plan to sell our Varis Division through a single disposal group. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, the Varis Division disposal group has met the accounting criteria to be classified as held for sale and therefore is presented as such. The disposition of our Varis Division represents a strategic shift that will have a major impact on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows of the Varis Division have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented beginning in the second quarter of 2024. Subsequently, on October 18, 2024, we sold our Varis Division to an affiliate of Arising Ventures, a third-party, while retaining a minority interest of 19.9 after the sale. Under the terms of the related stock purchase agreement, we will fund up to 4 million of expenses that may be incurred by Varis following the transaction date until December 31, 2025, and we have no further obligations to contribute capital to Varis. The terms of sale did not result in a materially different impact than previously estimated on our financial statements. We will account for our retained minority interest of 19.9 in Varis as an equity method investment going forward. Refer to Note 12. Discontinued Operations in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 RECENT GLOBAL EVENTS 
 We are closely monitoring the unfolding events due to the conflict in the Middle East, and its regional and global ramifications. We do not have operations in the Middle East, and our supply chain has not been impacted as of the date of this report. Other impacts due to this rapidly evolving situation are currently unknown and the broader economic impacts could potentially subject our business to materially adverse consequences should the situation escalate beyond its current scope.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY 
 The following summarizes the more significant factors impacting our operating results for the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 28, 2024 (also referred to as the third quarter of 2024 and year-to-date 2024, respectively) and September 30, 2023 (also referred to as the third quarter of 2023 and year-to-date 2023, respectively). 
 Our consolidated sales were lower by 227 million, or 11 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales in our ODP Business Solutions Division decreased 82 million, or 8 , as compared to the same period in the prior year. Our ODP Business Solutions Division experienced decreased sales across a majority of its product categories, primarily in furniture, cleaning and breakroom, and supplies. This was driven by lower demand from business-to-business customers, due to reduced spending, and fewer customers. Sales in our Office Depot Division decreased 148 million, or 15 , as compared to the same period in the prior year, mainly as a result of planned store closures, lower demand, and lower average order values at our retail stores and eCommerce platform. The sales decline was across the majority of Office Depot Division s product categories and was impacted by reduced spending of our customers during the competitive back-to-school season. The contribution of our Veyer Division to consolidated sales was not material. 
 Our consolidated sales were lower by 653 million, or 11 , year-to-date 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales in our ODP Business Solutions Division decreased 248 million, or 8 , and sales in our Office Depot Division decreased 411 million, or 14 , as compared to the same period in the prior year. The drivers of the sales decline year-to-date 2024 for both our ODP Business Solutions Division and Office Depot Division were consistent with those described above for the third quarter of 2024. The contribution of our Veyer Division to consolidated sales was not material.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IMPACTING TOTAL COMPANY RESULTS AND LIQUIDITY 
 Total gross profit decreased 108 million, or 23 in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Our Office Depot Division, ODP Business Solutions Division, and Veyer Division had 63 million, 40 million, and 5 million lower gross profit, respectively. Total gross profit decreased 252 million, or 18 , year-to-date 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Our Office Depot Division, ODP Business Solutions Division, and Veyer Division had 158 million, 80 million, and 14 million lower gross profit, respectively. The decreases in gross profit in both the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 were mainly due to the flow through impact of lower sales and decrease in gross margin. 

Total gross margin for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 was 20 and 21 , respectively. Total gross margin for both the third quarter and year-to-date 2023 was 24 and 23 , respectively. The decrease in gross margin is mainly the result of lower product margin and deleveraging of supply chain and occupancy costs. Our supply chain and occupancy costs have increased year-to-date 2024 as a percentage of sales, including transportation, facility and store rents, and utilities. 

Total selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 37 million and 99 million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. This decrease in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by decreases of 20 million in our Office Depot Division, 12 million in our ODP Business Solutions Division, and 4 million in our Veyer Division. This decrease year-to-date 2024 was driven by decreases of 62 million in our Office Depot Division, 27 million in our ODP Business Solutions Division, and 6 million in our Veyer Division. The remaining decrease for both periods is attributable to lower corporate expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales was 18 and flat in both the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, as compared to the same prior year periods. 

We recorded 7 million and 21 million of asset impairment charges in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, primarily related to the impairment of operating lease ROU assets associated with our retail store locations, with the remainder relating to impairment of fixed assets. Refer to Note 10. Fair Value Measurements in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Our merger and restructuring expenses, net were 2 million and 47 million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively. The expenses in the period related to restructuring activities, primarily 2 million and 44 million of restructuring costs associated with Project Core in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively. Refer to Note 3. Merger and Restructuring Activity in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Our effective tax rates were 28 and 27 for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, and 25 for both the third quarter and year-to-date 2023. For the third quarter of 2024, our effective tax rate was driven by the result of ongoing business activities rather than adjustments for discrete items. For year-to-date 2024, our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the recognition of a tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation awards year-to-date and the settlement of an uncertain tax position for less than the reserve in the first quarter, partially offset by additional uncertain tax positions in the second quarter. Refer to Note 5. Income Taxes in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 2.04 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.09 in the third quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 2.65 year-to-date 2024 compared to 5.18 year-to-date 2023. The decrease in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 compared to the same prior year periods is due to lower net income, partially offset by the impact of lower weighted average shares. Refer to Note 6. Earnings (Loss) Per Share in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations was (0.31) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to (0.30) in the third quarter of 2023. Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations was (2.64) year-to-date 2024 compared to (0.80) year-to-date 2023. 

Net diluted earnings per share was 1.73 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.79 in the third quarter of 2023. Net diluted earnings per share was 0.01 year-to-date 2024 compared to 4.38 year-to-date 2023. 

We repurchased 3 million shares of our common stock in the third quarter of 2024 for total consideration of 102 million. Year-to-date 2024, we repurchased 6 million shares of our common stock for a total consideration of 257 million. As of September 28, 2024, 768 million remains available for stock repurchases under the current stock repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of third quarter of 2024 and through October 30, 2024, we bought back 1 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 33 million. 

At September 28, 2024, we had 192 million in cash and cash equivalents, including 11 million that is presented in Current assets held for sale related to the Varis Division, and 536 million of available credit under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 7. Debt in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), for a total liquidity of approximately 728 million. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was 125 million year-to-date 2024 compared to cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations of 289 million in the comparable prior year period. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further information on cash flows.

Sales in our ODP Business Solutions Division decreased 84 million and 252 million, or 8 in both the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. During both the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, our ODP Business Solutions Division experienced decreased sales across a majority of its product categories, primarily in furniture, cleaning and breakroom, and supplies, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. This was driven by lower demand from business-to-business customers, due to reduced spending and fewer customers. We expect sales in our ODP Business Solutions Division to continue to be adversely impacted in the near term due to macroeconomic factors that continue to weigh on the U.S. economy, which can materially impact spending by our business-to-business customers and the demand for our products and services. Sales include internal sales of 2 million and 7 million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, which relate to ODP Business Solutions Division customers transactions held at Office Depot Division retail store locations. 
 Our ODP Business Solutions Division sales could be adversely impacted in the near term due to numerous factors, among others, a weaker U.S. economy and higher unemployment and inflation that materially impact spending, the demand for our products and services and the availability of supply. The changes in work environments as a result of the general macroeconomic environment, 
 25 

including ongoing remote work trends, have been material to the results of the ODP Business Solutions Division in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024. A prolonged or permanent shift to hybrid or continued remote work arrangements, as well as the substance and pace of macroeconomic recovery, could continue to have a material impact to the future results of the ODP Business Solutions Division. 
 Our ODP Business Solutions Division operating income was 28 million in the third quarter of 2024, which decreased 50 as compared to 56 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating income as a percentage of sales decreased 250 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The reduction in operating income was mainly due to the flow through impact of lower sales, as well as a 290 basis point lower gross margin rate primarily due to lower product margin rate and deleveraging in supply chain costs, which resulted in 40 million lower gross profit. The decrease in gross profit was partially offset by 12 million lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was 30 basis points lower compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, mainly due to lower employee-related costs as a result of Project Core. 
 Our ODP Business Solutions Division operating income was 87 million year-to-date 2024, which decreased 38 as compared to 140 million year-to-date 2023. Operating income as a percentage of sales decreased 150 basis points year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The reduction in operating income was mainly due to the flow through impact of lower sales, as well as a 150 basis point lower gross margin rate primarily due to deleveraging in supply chain costs, which resulted in 80 million lower gross profit. The decrease in gross profit was partially offset by 27 million lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was flat compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.

Sales in our Office Depot Division decreased 149 million and 414 million, or 15 and 14 , in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The largest drivers of our product sales decline for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 were planned store closures, lower demand, and lower average order values in our stores. Our eCommerce platform also experienced lower demand. The sales decline in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 was across the majority of our product categories. The demand for these categories was mainly impacted by reduced spending of our customers due to a competitive back-to-school season and macroeconomic factors affecting the U.S. economy. In addition, certain interruptions experienced due to inclement weather further impacted our store traffic during the back-to-school and back-to-business seasons, and our results for the quarter and year-to-date 2024. We believe sales in our Office Depot Division may continue to be adversely impacted in the near term and potentially longer related to numerous factors, among others, a weaker U.S. economy and higher unemployment that materially impact consumer spending and the demand for our products and services and increasing competitive pressures. 
 Sales include internal sales of 9 million and 24 million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, which relate to print services provided to the ODP Business Solutions Division as well as internal service fees for providing buy online, pick up in store BOPIS transactions to ODP Business Solutions Division customers. 
 Sales generated through our eCommerce platform include online sales fulfilled through warehouses, BOPIS transactions, online orders shipped from store, and same day delivery orders fulfilled with retail store inventory. These sales represented 34 and 33 of Office Depot Division s total sales in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, as compared to 29 of total sales in both the comparable prior periods. 
 Comparable store sales decreased 10 and 9 in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, reflecting lower store traffic and average order value, partially offset by higher conversion rate. The average order value was impacted by lower sales in our supplies, workspace and technology product categories. Our comparable store sales relate to stores that have been open for at least one year. Stores are removed from the comparable sales calculation one month prior to closing, as sales during that period are mostly related to clearance activity. Stores are also removed from the comparable sales calculation during periods of store remodeling, store closures due to hurricanes or natural disasters, or if significantly downsized. Our measure of comparable store sales has been applied consistently across periods but may differ from measures used by other companies. 
 Our Office Depot Division operating income was 23 million in the third quarter of 2024, which decreased 65 as compared to 66 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating income as a percentage of sales decreased 380 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The reduction in operating income was mainly due to the flow through impact of lower 
 26 

sales, as well as a 260 basis point lower gross margin rate primarily due to deleveraging in supply chain and occupancy costs, which resulted in 63 million lower gross profit. The decrease in gross profit was partially offset by 20 million lower selling, general and administrative expenses, which was driven by store closures as part of the Maximize B2B Restructuring Plan, and other initiatives to reduce costs as our retail footprint is reduced. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 130 basis points higher due to deleveraging from lower sales. 
 Our Office Depot Division operating income was 91 million year-to-date 2024, which decreased 51 as compared to 186 million year-to-date 2023. Operating income as a percentage of sales decreased 270 basis points year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The reduction in operating income was mainly due to the flow through impact of lower sales as well as a 180 basis point lower gross margin rate primarily due to deleveraging in supply chain and occupancy costs, which resulted in 158 million lower gross profit. The decrease in gross profit was partially offset by 62 million lower selling, general and administrative costs, resulting from the initiatives discussed above. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 90 basis points higher compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, mainly due to deleveraging from lower sales. 
 As of September 28, 2024, our Office Depot Division operated 885 retail stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands compared to 938 stores at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Charges associated with store closures as part of a restructuring plan are reported as appropriate in Asset impairments and Merger and restructuring expenses, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, as part of our periodic recoverability assessment of owned retail store and distribution center assets and operating lease ROU assets, we recognize impairment charges in the Asset impairments line item of our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. These charges are reflected in Corporate reporting and are not included in the determination of Division operating income. Refer to the Corporate section below for additional information of expenses incurred to date.

Internal sales represent sales of product and supply chain services provided to our Office Depot Division and ODP Business Solutions Division, which are then sold to third-party customers through those divisions. Internal sales of product are made at a price that includes a service fee to the cost of product we source from third-party vendors, net of the impact of vendor income, and certain other adjustments. Internal sales of services represent supply chain and logistics support services, which include warehousing, shipping and handling, returns and others. These internal sales of services are also provided to the Office Depot Division and the ODP Business Solutions Division, at a service fee over cost. Internal sales are eliminated upon consolidation. 
 Our Veyer Division aims to be the lowest cost provider to the Office Depot Division and the ODP Business Solutions Division, with the purpose of achieving the most favorable outcome for our consolidated results. As a result, Veyer Division s internal sales and profitability related to these internal sales could be impacted by product cost fluctuations and activities that we may undertake to drive efficiencies in the Veyer Division, including rebates we may receive from third-party vendors, as well as decisions made independently by the Office Depot Division and ODP Business Solutions Division for alternative sourcing options to meet customer needs. 
 In the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, 558 million and 629 million of internal sales are to the Office Depot Division, and 631 million and 691 million are to the ODP Business Solutions Division, respectively. The decrease in internal sales to the Office Depot Division is related to the decline in customer demand at our retail stores and eCommerce platform, which is discussed further in the Office Depot Division section above. The decrease in internal sales to the ODP Business Solutions Division is related to reduced demand experienced by ODP Business Solutions Division during the third quarter of 2024, which is discussed further in the ODP Business Solutions Division section above. Year-to-date 2024 and year-to-date 2023, 1.7 billion and 1.9 billion of internal sales are to the Office Depot Division, respectively, and 1.9 billion and 2.1 billion are to the ODP Business Solutions Division, respectively. The drivers of the change in internal sales to the Office Depot Division and the ODP Business Solutions Division year-to-date 2024 are consistent with those described above. 
 External sales represent supply chain services provided to third parties, as well as product sales by our Asia sourcing operation to third parties. The 3 million and 6 million increase in external sales in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year were driven by supply chain services and product sales to third parties. 
 Our Veyer Division operating income was 9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 10 million in the third quarter of 2023, which was driven by the flow through impact of lower internal sales. Our Veyer Division operating income was 23 million year-to-date 2024 compared to 31 million year-to-date 2023. The decrease in both periods was mainly due to the flow through impact of 
 27 

lower internal sales, partially offset by favorable third-party profit. The gross margin rate was relatively flat in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Future performance of our Veyer Division is dependent upon market conditions in the transportation and logistics industry, including fluctuations in labor and fuel costs, and its ability to pass any cost increases through to its customers. 
 CORPORATE 
 The line items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations included as Corporate activities are Asset impairments and Merger and restructuring expenses, net. These activities are managed at the Corporate level and, accordingly, are not included in the determination of Division income for management reporting or external disclosures. In addition to these charges and credits, certain selling, general and administrative expenses are not allocated to the Divisions and are managed at the Corporate level. Those expenses are addressed in the section Unallocated Expenses below. 
 Asset impairments 
 We recognized asset impairment charges of 7 million and 21 million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024. Of these asset impairment charges, 7 million and 19 million related to the impairment of operating lease ROU assets associated with our retail store locations, with the remainder relating to impairment of fixed assets. We recognized asset impairment charges of 3 million and 13 million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2023. Of these asset impairment charges, 2 million and 8 million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2023, respectively, was related to the impairment of operating lease ROU assets associated with our retail store locations, with the remainder relating to impairment of fixed assets and other assets. 
 We regularly review retail store assets for impairment indicators at the individual store level, as this represents the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indicators of impairment are present, a recoverability analysis is performed which considers the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the retail store s remaining life and uses inputs from retail operations and accounting and finance personnel. These inputs include our best estimates of retail store-level sales, gross margins, direct expenses, exercise of future lease renewal options when reasonably certain to be exercised, and resulting cash flows, which, by their nature, include judgments about how current initiatives will impact future performance. In the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, the assumptions used within the recoverability analysis for the retail stores were updated to consider current quarter retail store operational results and formal plans for future retail store closures as part of our restructuring programs, including the probability of closure at the retail store level. While it is generally expected that closures will approximate the store s lease termination date, it is possible that changes in store performance or other conditions could result in future changes in assumptions utilized. In addition, the assumptions used reflected declining sales over the forecast period, and gross margin and operating cost assumptions that are consistent with recent actual results and consider plans for future initiatives. If the undiscounted cash flows of a retail store cannot support the carrying amount of its assets, the assets are impaired and written down to estimated fair value. 
 We test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of the first day of fiscal December or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. There were no events or changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred during the third quarter of 2024. We will continue to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment. If the operating results of our reporting units deteriorate in the future, it may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in goodwill impairment charges. Further, while we are currently in a strong liquidity and capital position, a significant deterioration may have a material impact on our liquidity and capital in future periods. 
 Merger and restructuring expenses, net 
 We have taken actions to optimize our asset base and drive operational efficiencies. These actions include acquiring profitable businesses, closing underperforming retail stores and non-strategic distribution facilities, consolidating functional activities, eliminating redundant positions, and disposing of non-strategic businesses and assets. The expenses and any income recognized directly associated with these actions are included in Merger and restructuring expenses, net on a separate line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in order to identify these activities apart from the expenses incurred to sell to and service customers. These expenses are not included in the determination of Division operating income. 
 28 

In March 2024, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan to redesign our company-wide low-cost business model approach and create further efficiencies in our business to lower costs Project Core ). This was driven by a need to significantly reduce costs due to macroeconomic and other factors impacting our sales, as well as insights gained following the first year of operations of realignment of our operating segments into four divisions. The scope of Project Core was approved in two phases, in March 2024 and April 2024, and includes cost improvement actions across the entire enterprise, including our Varis Division, which is presented as discontinued operations beginning in the second quarter of 2024. It aims to optimize our organizational structure to support future growth of the business. Project Core is expected to be completed in 2025, with the majority of actions expected to be taken by the end of 2024. Total restructuring costs related to Project Core are estimated to be up to 57 million, of which 35 million are estimated to be termination benefits, which mainly consists of severance, and 22 million are estimated to be costs to facilitate the program, which mainly consists of third-party professional fees and other incremental employee-related costs to implement actions. All costs of Project Core are expected to be cash expenditures. 
 Merger and restructuring expenses, net were 2 million and 47 million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, compared to 1 million and 2 million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2023, respectively. Of the expenses in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, 2 million and 44 million, respectively, relate to Project Core. Also related to Project Core and included within discontinued operations year-to-date 2024 are 8 million of severance expenses in our Varis Division. Refer to Note 3 Merger and Restructuring Activity in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional analysis of these Corporate charges. 
 Legal matter monetization 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized 70 million of income in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations related to legal matter monetization where we are engaged in legal proceedings as a plaintiff. This income is included within Receivables, net in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2024. We subsequently received the proceeds in October 2024. 
 Unallocated Expenses 
 We allocate to our Divisions functional support expenses that are considered to be directly or closely related to segment activity. These allocated expenses are included in the measurement of Division operating income. Other companies may charge more or less for functional support expenses to their segments, and our results, therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The unallocated expenses primarily consist of the buildings used for our corporate headquarters and personnel not directly supporting the Divisions, including certain executive, finance, legal, audit and similar functions. Unallocated expenses were 19 million and 60 million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, compared to 20 million and 63 million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2023, respectively. The decrease in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 was primarily due to lower corporate payroll and incentive expenses.

We recorded 1 million of interest expense year-to-date 2024, and 1 million and 4 million of interest expense in the third quarter and year-to-date 2023, respectively, related to the Third Amended Credit Agreement. In May 2024, we entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which provided for an 800 million asset-based revolving credit facility, maturing in May 2029. This agreement replaced our then existing amended and restated credit agreement, the Third Amended Credit Agreement, that was due to mature in April 2025. We recognized less than 1 million of loss from modification of debt related to this transaction in the second quarter of 2024, which represented the write-off certain unamortized debt issuance costs as of the closing date of the transaction. We recorded 3 million and 4 million of interest expense in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, related to the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement. We also recorded interest expense related to our finance lease obligations and revenue bonds in all periods presented. 
 Other income, net includes the pension credit related to the frozen OfficeMax pension and other benefit plans, as well as the pension credit related to the pension plan in the United Kingdom that has been retained by us in connection with the sale of the European Business. 
 29 

Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rates were 28 and 27 for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, and 25 for both the third quarter and year-to-date 2023. For the third quarter of 2024, our effective tax rate was driven by the result of ongoing business activities rather than adjustments for discrete items. For year-to-date 2024, our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the recognition of a tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation awards year-to-date and the settlement of an uncertain tax position for less than the reserve in the first quarter, partially offset by additional uncertain tax positions in the second quarter. These factors, along with the impact of state taxes and the mix of income and losses across U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, caused our effective tax rates for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 to differ from the statutory rate of 21 . For the third quarter and year-to-date 2023, our effective tax rates were primarily impacted by the recognition of a tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation award. Changes in pretax income projections and the mix of income across jurisdictions could impact the effective tax rates in future quarters. 
 We continue to have a U.S. valuation allowance for certain U.S. federal credits and state tax attributes, which relates to deferred tax assets that require certain types of income or for income to be earned in certain jurisdictions in order to be realized. We will continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and remaining foreign jurisdictions in future periods. Changes in pretax income projections could impact this evaluation in future periods. 
 We file a U.S. federal income tax return and other income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal and state and local income tax examinations for years prior to 2021 and 2014, respectively. The acquired OfficeMax U.S. consolidated group is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examination, and with few exceptions, is no longer subject to U.S. state and local income tax examinations for years prior to 2013. Generally, we are subject to routine examination for years 2013 and forward in our international tax jurisdictions. 
 It is anticipated that 1 million of tax positions will be resolved within the next 12 months. Additionally, we anticipate that it is reasonably possible that new issues will be raised or resolved by tax authorities that may require changes to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits; however, an estimate of such changes cannot be reasonably made at this time. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reached agreement among various countries to implement a minimum 15 tax rate on certain multinational enterprises, commonly referred to as Pillar Two. Many countries continue to announce changes in their tax laws and regulations based on the Pillar Two proposals. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of these proposed and enacted legislative changes as new guidance becomes available. We do not expect these legislative changes to have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, tax liabilities or cash tax. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 Refer to Note 12. Discontinued Operations in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Varis Division which is accounted for as discontinued operations. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 LIQUIDITY 
 At September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we had 192 million and 392 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively, of which 11 million and 10 million at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, is presented in Current assets held for sale related to the Varis Division. In addition, at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we had 536 million and 696 million of available credit under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement, respectively, for a total liquidity of approximately 728 million and 1.1 billion at the end of each respective period. Despite the weaker global economic conditions and the uncertainties related to the current macroeconomic environment, we currently believe that as a result of our strong financial position, including our cash and cash equivalents on hand, availability of funds under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement, and future year cash flows generated from operations, we will be able to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt repayments, common stock repurchases, dividends (if any), merger integration and restructuring expenses, and future acquisitions consistent with our strategic growth initiatives for at least the next twelve months from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. From time to time, we may prepay outstanding debt and/or restructure or refinance debt obligations. 
 Financing 
 On May 9, 2024, as disclosed in Note 7. Debt, we entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which provides for an 800 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the New Facility ). The New Facility matures in May 2029. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement replaced our then existing amended and restated credit agreement, the Third Amended Credit Agreement, that was due to mature in April 2025. The Company retired 53 million of outstanding FILO Term Loan Facility loans under the Third Amended Credit Agreement prior to its amendment, resulting in no remaining FILO Term Loan Facility loans. 
 30 

Year-to-date 2024, we elected to draw down 520 million from the credit facilities under the Third and Fourth Amended Credit Agreements for working capital management. Of this amount, 397 million was repaid year-to-date 2024, resulting in 123 million of revolving loans outstanding under the New Facility at September 28, 2024. Also, at September 28, 2024, we had 41 million of outstanding standby letters of credit and 536 million of available credit under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants at September 28, 2024. 
 Acquisitions and dispositions 
 In addition to the business acquisition disclosed herein, we have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets in connection with our strategic transformation. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, our securities or the incurrence of additional indebtedness. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We estimate capital expenditures in 2024 to be up to approximately 95 million, which includes investments to support our business priorities. These expenditures will be funded through available cash on hand and operating cash flows. 
 Capital Return Programs Share Repurchases and Dividends 
 In February 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program of up to 1 billion of our common stock, available through March 31, 2027, which replaced the then existing 1 billion stock repurchase program. Year-to-date 2024, we repurchased 6 million shares of our common stock for total consideration of 257 million. As of September 28, 2024, 768 million remains available for stock repurchases under the current stock repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2024 and through October 30, 2024, we repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 33 million. Considering the ongoing macroeconomic environment and our operating results in year-to-date 2024, we expect to substantially moderate the pace of stock repurchases in the near-term. 
 The new authorization may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The stock repurchase authorization permits us to repurchase stock from time-to-time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, 10b5-1 trading plans, accelerated stock repurchase transactions and/or other derivative transactions. The exact number and timing of stock repurchases will depend on market conditions and other factors and will be funded through available cash balances. Our Fourth Amended Credit Agreement permits restricted payments, such as common stock repurchases, but may be limited if we do not meet the required minimum liquidity or fixed charge coverage ratio requirements. The authorized amount under the stock repurchase program excludes fees, commissions, taxes or other expenses. 
 We did not declare any cash dividends in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024. We do not anticipate declaring cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our Fourth Amended Credit Agreement permits restricted payments, such as dividends, but may be limited if we do not meet the required minimum liquidity or fixed charge coverage ratio requirements. 
 We will continue to evaluate our capital return programs as appropriate. Decisions regarding future share repurchases and dividends are within the discretion of our Board of Directors, and depend on a number of factors, including, general business and economic conditions, which includes the impact of COVID-19 on such conditions, and other factors which are discussed in this discussion and analysis and Risk Factors within Other Key Information in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Operating Activities 
 Year-to-date 2024, cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was 125 million, compared to 289 million during the corresponding period in 2023. This decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily driven by 103 million less net income after adjusting for non-cash charges, 26 million less usage of deferred tax assets, and 35 million less cash flows from working capital. Working capital is influenced by a number of factors, including period end sales, the flow of goods, credit terms, timing of promotions, vendor production planning, new product introductions and working capital management. Year-to-date 2024, the primary driver for lower cash flows from working capital was 45 million less cash flows from our receivables and 45 million less cash flows from our inventories, partially offset by a 59 million increase from trade payables and other liabilities. The changes in our payables and other liabilities and in other current and noncurrent assets are reflective of the timing of payments. The change in inventories is mainly attributable to purchase volume. 
 For our accounting policy on cash management, refer to Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was 78 million year-to-date 2024, compared to cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of 43 million year-to-date 2023. The cash outflow year-to-date 2024 was driven by 72 million in capital expenditures associated with improvements in our service platform, distribution network, and eCommerce capabilities, and 11 million outflow related to business acquisition, partially offset by 1 million of proceeds from disposition of assets and 4 million proceeds from settlement of company owned life insurance contracts. The cash inflow year-to-date 2023 was driven by 105 million of proceeds from disposition of assets, of which 100 million related to the sale of our corporate headquarters. These inflows were partially offset by 56 million in capital expenditures associated with improvements in our service platform, distribution network, and eCommerce capabilities, as well as 9 million outflow related to business acquisition. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was 214 million year-to-date 2024, compared to 306 million year-to-date 2023. The cash outflow year-to-date 2024 primarily consisted of 397 million related to the repayment of the New Facility, 254 million in repurchases of common stock, including commissions, 53 million related to the retirement of our FILO Term Loan Facility loans, 15 million share purchases for taxes, net of proceeds, for employee share-based transactions, and 8 million of net payments on long- and short-term borrowings activity related to our debt. These outflows were partially offset by 520 million draw down on the New Facility. The cash outflow year-to-date 2023 primarily consisted of 264 million in repurchases of common stock, including commissions, 26 million share purchases for taxes, net of proceeds, for employee share-based transactions, and 12 million of net payments on long- and short-term borrowings activity related to our debt. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 Cash used in operating, investing and financing activities of discontinued operations is summarized as follows:

 (15) 

Cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was 23 million year-to-date 2024, compared to 27 million year-to-date 2023. The change in operating cash flows of discontinued operations in the comparative period was primarily driven by less cash outflows from working capital in discontinued operations year-to-date 2024. 
 Cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was 7 million year-to-date 2024, compared to 15 million year-to-date 2023. The change in investing cash flows of discontinued operations in the comparative period reflects the reduction in capital expenditures in discontinued operations related to the Varis Division, partially offset by 5 million of proceeds received from the purchaser of our CompuCom Division year-to-date 2023 to settle the cash, debt and working capital adjustments related to sale of this division.
