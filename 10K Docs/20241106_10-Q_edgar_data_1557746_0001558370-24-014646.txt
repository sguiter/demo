 ACLARIS THERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS million and an accumulated deficit of million. Since inception, the Company has incurred net losses and negative cash flows from its operations. There can be no assurance that profitable operations will ever be achieved, and, if achieved, will be sustained on a continuing basis. In addition, development activities, including clinical and preclinical testing of the Company s drug candidates, will require significant additional financing. The future viability of the Company is dependent on its ability to successfully develop its drug candidates and to generate revenue from identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize its development assets or to raise additional capital to finance its operations. The Company will require additional capital to develop its drug candidates and to support its discovery efforts. Additional funds may not be available on a timely basis, on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, and such funds, if raised, may not be sufficient to enable the Company to continue to implement its long-term business strategy. The Company's ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potentially worsening global economic conditions caused by a variety of factors including geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional capital or generate revenue from transactions with potential third-party partners for the development and/or commercialization of its drug candidates, it may need to substantially curtail planned operations. The Company s failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on its financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategies. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 205-40, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that its condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. As of the report date, the Company does not believe that substantial doubt exists about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are sufficient to fund its operating and capital expenditure requirements for a period greater than 12 months from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.

Overview We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel drug candidates for immuno-inflammatory diseases. Our proprietary KINect drug discovery platform combined with our preclinical development capabilities allows us to identify and advance potential drug candidates that we may develop independently or in collaboration with third parties. In addition to identifying and developing our novel drug candidates, we are pursuing strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our novel drug candidates. We also provide contract research services to third parties enabled by our early-stage research and development expertise. In January 2024, we announced that we are undertaking a strategic review of our business. ATI-2138, an Investigational Oral Covalent ITK/JAK3 Inhibitor ATI-2138 is an investigational oral covalent inhibitor of interleukin-2-inducible T cell kinase, or ITK, and Janus kinase, or JAK, 3 for the potential treatment of T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. The ITK/JAK3 compound interrupts T cell signaling through the combined inhibition of ITK/JAK3 pathways in lymphocytes. In September 2023, we announced positive results from our two-week Phase 1 placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple ascending dose, or MAD, trial of ATI-2138 (ATI-2138-PKPD-102). ATI-2138-PKPD-102 was designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and pharmacodynamics of ATI-2138 in healthy volunteers. The trial enrolled 60 healthy volunteers across 6 dosing cohorts ranging from 10 to 80 mg of total daily doses, with eight volunteers receiving ATI-2138 and two volunteers receiving placebo in each arm. Data from the trial demonstrated that ATI-2138 was generally well tolerated at all doses tested and had dose proportional PK. Additionally, ATI-2138 demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of both ITK and JAK3 exploratory pharmacodynamic biomarkers, with near maximal inhibition achieved at the 30 mg total daily dose. No serious adverse events were reported. In September 2024, we announced that we dosed the first patient in our Phase 2a open-label trial to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of ATI-2138 administered over 12 weeks in approximately 15 patients in the United States with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The primary endpoints are safety related parameters. Secondary endpoints include Eczema Area and Severity Index, or EASI, response (EASI-50, EASI-74, EASI-

 90), Validated Investigator Global Assessment (vIGA) response, body surface area (BSA) response and other pertinent efficacy related measures . We expect to announce top-line data in the first half of 2025. Lepzacitinib, an Investigational Topical Soft JAK 1/3 Inhibitor Lepzacitinib, also referred to as ATI-1777, is an investigational topical soft JAK 1/3 inhibitor for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis and other dermatologic conditions. Soft JAK inhibitors are designed to be topically applied and active in the skin, but rapidly metabolized and inactivated when they enter the bloodstream, which may result in low systemic exposure. Lepzacitinib has been adopted as the nonproprietary name for ATI-1777. In January 2024, we announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2b multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group trial of lepzacitinib in patients with mild to severe atopic dermatitis (ATI-1777-AD-202). ATI-1777-AD-202 was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK of multiple concentrations (0.5 , 1 and 2 of twice daily, or BID, treatment with lepzacitinib and a single concentration (2 of once daily, or QD, treatment with lepzacitinib. The trial randomized 250 patients with mild, moderate or severe atopic dermatitis, including adults and children as young as 12 years old, across 30 clinical trial sites in the United States. The trial met the primary efficacy endpoint, the percent change from baseline in the EASI score at week 4, with statistical significance for patients treated with lepzacitinib 2 BID compared to patients treated with vehicle (69.7 versus 58.7 in the pooled vehicle group, p=0.035). In addition, a PK analysis showed minimal levels of exposure to lepzacitinib. The mean steady state trough drug levels at week 4 were 0.319 ng/mL, representing 0.7 of IC50 for JAK 1/3 inhibition in whole blood. In total, 97 of lepzacitinib plasma samples from dosed patients had concentrations below 1/10th of the IC50, and six samples (from five lepzacitinib treated patients) of 570 samples analyzed had concentrations above 1/4 of the IC50. No meaningful safety findings were observed and lepzacitinib was well tolerated. We are currently seeking a global development and commercialization partner for this program (excluding Greater China). In 2022, we granted Pediatrix Therapeutics, Inc. exclusive rights to develop and commercialize lepzacitinib in Greater China. Zunsemetinib, an Investigational Oral MK2 Inhibitor Zunsemetinib, or ATI-450, is an investigational oral, novel, small molecule selective MK2 inhibitor for the potential treatment of metastatic breast cancer, or MBC, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or PDAC. We plan to support Washington University in St. Louis in its investigator-initiated Phase 1b/2 trials of zunsemetinib in patients with MBC and PDAC . We expect these trials to be primarily funded by grants awarded to Washington University. Discovery Programs and KINect Drug Discovery Platform We conduct small molecule drug discovery and preclinical development research through KINect, our proprietary drug discovery platform. Our KINect platform enables us to identify potential drug candidates through a unique combination of our proprietary chemical library of kinase inhibitors, our novel approaches to inhibitor modalities, our expertise in structure-based drug design, and our custom kinase assays. Our focus has been on difficult to drug kinase targets that exhibit some level of clinical, genetic and/or pharmacological disease validation. Our approach involves the following mechanisms: (1) reversible and irreversible covalent inhibitors, (2) molecular glue/complex targeted inhibitors and (3) targeted protein degraders. These novel approaches are currently being utilized to prosecute additional validated, difficult to drug kinase targets with the goal of demonstrating potential platform utility. We are actively progressing several discovery programs focused on delivering the next wave of drug candidates from our KINect platform. Our discovery efforts center on targeting kinases that play pivotal roles in various inflammatory, autoimmune, and oncology pathways. For example, we are progressing to development candidate selection a second generation ITK selective inhibitor for autoimmune indications. We intend to evaluate both internal and external development options, including strategic partnerships, for these assets.

 Discontinued Programs We were previously developing zunsemetinib as a potential treatment for various immuno-inflammatory diseases, including hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Following the results of the Phase 2 trials for these programs, we discontinued further development of our MK2 inhibitor programs in immuno-inflammatory diseases in 2023. Financial Overview Since our inception, we have incurred significant net losses. Our net loss was 35.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 88.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 806.3 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates from discovery through preclinical and clinical development. In addition, our drug candidates, even if they are approved by regulatory agencies for marketing, may not achieve commercial success. We may also not be successful in pursuing strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates. Furthermore, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with operating as a public company, including legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations. We have historically financed our operations primarily with sales of equity securities and incurring indebtedness in the form of loans from commercial lenders. In the near term, we expect to finance our operations through these and other capital sources, including potential partnerships with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development of one or more of our drug candidates. Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions on Our Business Unfavorable conditions in the economy both in the United States and abroad may negatively affect the growth of our business and our results of operations. For example, macroeconomic events, including inflationary pressure and geopolitical conflicts, have led to economic uncertainty globally. The effect of macroeconomic conditions may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. If, however, economic uncertainty increases or the global economy worsens, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. Acquisition and License Agreements Royalty Purchase Agreement with OCM IP Healthcare Portfolio LP In July 2024, we entered into a royalty purchase agreement with OCM IP Healthcare Portfolio LP, an investment vehicle for Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, or OMERS. Under the royalty purchase agreement, we sold to OMERS a portion of the future royalty payments and the remaining anniversary milestones associated with our existing license to Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, relating to OLUMIANT (baricitinib) for the treatment of alopecia areata (see License Agreement with Eli Lilly and Company ). Under the terms of the royalty purchase agreement, we received an upfront payment of 26.5 million and are eligible to receive up to an additional 5.0 million based on the achievement of certain sales milestones for OLUMIANT in 2024. In exchange, OMERS acquired a portion of the royalty payable by Lilly to us for worldwide net sales of OLUMIANT for the treatment of alopecia areata from April 1, 2024 through the remainder of the royalty term under our license agreement with Lilly, and 100 of the remaining anniversary milestone payments payable by Lilly to us under the license agreement. The royalty payments and milestones we sold to OMERS represent our entire financial interest in the Lilly license agreement after taking into account our other contractual third-party obligations. We recognized 0.9 million of non-cash royalty income during each of the three and nine months ended

 September 30, 2024. License Agreement with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. In December 2023, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., or Sun Pharma. Under the license agreement, we granted Sun Pharma exclusive rights under certain patents that we exclusively license from a third party. The patents relate to the use of deuruxolitinib, Sun Pharma s JAK inhibitor, or other isotopic forms of ruxolitinib, to treat alopecia areata or androgenetic alopecia. Under the license agreement, Sun Pharma has paid us an upfront payment, and has agreed to pay us regulatory and commercial milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones set forth in the agreement, and a mid single-digit tiered royalty calculated as a percentage of Sun Pharma s net sales. We have separate contractual obligations under which we have agreed to pay to third parties a portion of the consideration we may receive under the license agreement. Upon execution of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of 15.0 million from Sun Pharma, a portion of which was payable to third parties. We recognized 3.0 million of licensing revenue during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. License Agreement with Pediatrix Therapeutics, Inc. In November 2022, we entered into a license agreement with Pediatrix Therapeutics, Inc., or Pediatrix, under which we granted Pediatrix the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize lepzacitinib in Greater China. Pediatrix has paid us an upfront payment, and has agreed to pay us development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones set forth in the agreement, and a tiered royalty ranging from a low-to-high single digit percentage of net sales of lepzacitinib by Pediatrix in Greater China. A portion of the consideration received from Pediatrix is payable to the former Confluence equity holders as described below under the caption Agreement and Plan of Merger with Confluence. License Agreement with Eli Lilly and Company In August 2022, we entered into a non-exclusive patent license agreement with Lilly. Under the license agreement, we granted Lilly non-exclusive rights under certain patents and patent applications that we exclusively license from a third party. The patents and patent applications relate to the use of baricitinib, Lilly s JAK inhibitor, to treat alopecia areata. Under the license agreement, Lilly has paid us an upfront payment and regulatory and certain commercial milestone payments, and agreed to pay us anniversary payments and other commercial milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones as set forth in the agreement, and a low single-digit royalty calculated as a percentage of Lilly s net sales of baricitinib for the treatment of alopecia areata. We have separate contractual obligations under which we have agreed to pay to third parties an amount equal to any regulatory and commercial milestone payments we receive under the Lilly license agreement, as well as a portion of the upfront consideration and a portion of the royalties we may receive under the license agreement. We recognized 0.7 million and 8.3 million of licensing revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 4.6 million and 10.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Asset Purchase Agreement with EPI Health In October 2019, we sold RHOFADE (oxymetazoline hydrochloride) cream, 1 , or RHOFADE, to EPI Health, LLC, or EPI Health, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. In July 2023, EPI Health filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Through the bankruptcy process, EPI Health and its parent company, Novan, Inc., sold the RHOFADE assets to a third party, which excluded our asset purchase agreement with EPI Health and the outstanding amounts due. The sale was approved by the bankruptcy court in September 2023. As a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, all amounts that are due and outstanding by EPI Health have been fully reserved.

 Agreement and Plan of Merger with Confluence In 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Confluence Agreement, with Confluence Life Sciences, Inc. (now known as Aclaris Life Sciences, Inc.), or Confluence, Aclaris Life Sciences, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, or Merger Sub, and Fortis Advisors LLC, as representative of the equity holders of Confluence. Pursuant to the terms of the Confluence Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Confluence, with Confluence surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary. Under the Confluence Agreement, we have agreed to pay the former Confluence equity holders aggregate remaining contingent consideration of up to 75.0 million based upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones set forth in the Confluence Agreement. In addition, we have agreed to pay the former Confluence equity holders future royalty payments calculated as a low single-digit percentage of annual net sales, subject to specified reductions, limitations and other adjustments, until the date that all of the patent rights for that product have expired, as determined on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis or, in specified circumstances, ten years from the first commercial sale of such product. In addition to the payments described above, if we sell, license or transfer any of the intellectual property acquired from Confluence pursuant to the Confluence Agreement to a third party, we will be obligated to pay the former Confluence equity holders a portion of any consideration received from such sale, license, or transfer in specified circumstances. Restructuring In December 2023, our Board of Directors approved a reduction of our workforce by approximately 46 , which was substantially completed as of June 30, 2024. This action was taken in order to streamline operations, reduce costs and preserve capital. As a result, we terminated certain employees, or terminated employees, and gave notice to additional employees, or noticed employees, who were asked to provide transition services through termination dates ranging between one to thirteen months from the date notice was given. The terminated employees were entitled to receive cash severance payments and other benefits. The noticed employees are entitled to receive cash severance payments and other benefits, which are contingent upon providing additional services to us. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized severance expense of 26 thousand and 2.6 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made cash severance payments of 5.2 million to impacted employees. Components of Our Results of Operations Revenue Contract Research We earn revenue from the provision of laboratory services. Contract research revenue is generally evidenced by contracts with clients which are on an agreed upon fixed-price, fee-for-service basis and are generally billed on a monthly basis in arrears for services rendered. Licensing Licensing revenue primarily consists of upfront consideration, royalties and milestone payments earned pursuant to license and acquisition agreements with third parties, as described above.

Table of Contents 
 Cost and Expenses Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists of the costs incurred in connection with the provision of contract research services. Cost of revenue primarily includes: employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation; outsourced professional scientific services; depreciation of laboratory equipment; facility-related costs; and laboratory materials and supplies used to support the services provided. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our drug candidates. These expenses primarily include: expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as clinical trial sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies, and investigator-initiated trials; manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients and preclinical and clinical trial materials, including domestic technology transfer expenses; quality assurance and quality control costs; outsourced professional scientific development services; medical affairs expenses related to our drug candidates; employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation; expenses relating to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies; and laboratory materials and supplies used to support our research activities. Research and development activities are central to our business model. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in the near term as we continue the development of our drug candidates and pursue our discovery programs. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Our direct research and development expenses primarily consist of external costs including fees paid to CROs, consultants, clinical trial sites, regulatory agencies and third parties that manufacture our preclinical and clinical trial materials and are tracked on a program-by-program basis. We do not allocate personnel costs or other indirect expenses to specific research and development programs. The successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. We cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of, or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from any of our drug candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including: the number of clinical sites included in the trials; the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects; the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials; the number of doses subjects receive; the duration of subject follow-up; and the results of our clinical trials. Our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the preparation of regulatory filings for our drug candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials or other development activities. We may elect 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 to discontinue, delay, or modify the development, including clinical trials, of some drug candidates or focus on others. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, administrative, finance and legal functions. General and administrative expenses also include facility-related costs, patent filing and prosecution costs, professional fees for legal, auditing and tax services, investor relations costs, business development costs, insurance costs, and travel expenses. Licensing Licensing expenses consist of third-party contractual obligations incurred under license and acquisition agreements with third parties, as described above. Revaluation of Contingent Consideration Revaluation of contingent consideration consists of changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability between reporting dates, as described below. Other Income Interest Income Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Non-cash Royalty Income In July 2024, we entered into the royalty purchase agreement with OMERS pursuant to which we sold a portion of our royalties due to us under the license agreement with Lilly and received upfront proceeds of 26.5 million. We evaluated the royalty purchase agreement under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 470 Debt and concluded that the upfront payment should be accounted for as deferred income as the criteria for debt classification were not met. We apply the units-of-revenue method of recognizing income in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and such amounts are included in non-cash royalty income. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 0.9 million of non-cash royalty income. Critical Accounting Estimates This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies and use of estimates as disclosed in the footnotes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024.

 Contingent Consideration We record a contingent consideration liability related to future potential payments resulting from the acquisition of Confluence based upon significant unobservable inputs including the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as estimated future sales levels and the discount rates applied to calculate the present value of the potential payments. Significant judgement is involved in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions. These assumptions are considered Level 3 inputs. Revaluation of our contingent consideration liability can result from changes to one or more of these assumptions. These assumptions are highly dependent on the outcome and timing of the development of certain of our drug candidates. We evaluate the fair value estimate of our contingent consideration liability on a quarterly basis with changes, if any, recorded as income or expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Any such changes could have a material impact on our financial results. The fair value of contingent consideration is estimated using a probability-weighted expected payment model for regulatory milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for commercial milestone and royalty payments and then applying a risk-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the potential payments. Significant assumptions used in our estimates include the probability of achieving regulatory milestones and commencing commercialization, which are based on an asset s current stage of development and a review of existing clinical data. Probability of success assumptions ranged between 17 and 40 at September 30, 2024. Additionally, estimated future sales levels and the risk-adjusted discount rate applied to the potential payments are also significant assumptions used in calculating the fair value. The discount rate ranged between 6.6 and 7.9 depending on the year of each potential payment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a charge to the contingent consideration liability of 3.8 million, which was primarily due to changes in estimated sales levels, changes to the probability of success for certain drug candidates, and the passage of time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we removed estimated sales from zunsemetinib for moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa following our decision to cease pursuing that indication. As a result of this, as well as due to higher discount rates resulting from higher risk-free rates and changes in credit spreads being applied to potential payments relative to prior periods, we recorded an overall decrease in contingent consideration of 0.6 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the probability of success, as well as the passage of time.

Contract research revenue was 1.9 million and 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was comprised of fees earned from the provision of laboratory services. The decrease was driven by lower overall hours billed and a lower average billing rate. Licensing Licensing revenue was 3.7 million and 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by the achievement of higher milestones under license agreements during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. The royalty sale to OMERS in July 2024 also contributed to the decrease in licensing revenue. Licensing revenue was 7.6 million and 11.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by the achievement of higher milestones under license agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The royalty sale to OMERS in July 2024 also contributed to the decrease in licensing revenue.

 Costs and Expenses Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue was 0.7 million and 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and in each case, related to providing laboratory services. Changes in cost of revenue generally correlate to changes in contract research revenue. Cost of revenue was 2.1 million and 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and in each case, related to providing laboratory services. Changes in cost of revenue generally correlate to changes in contract research revenue. Cost of revenue decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period due to lower variable costs resulting from a decrease in hours billed, which was offset by an increase in termination benefits, as a result of our restructuring that was announced in December 2023. Research and Development The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by drug candidate or, for unallocated expenses, by type:

Drug candidate manufacturing costs also decreased accordingly. Lepzacitinib The decrease in expenses for lepzacitinib during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2023 was primarily due to lower costs associated with preclinical development activities and costs associated with a Phase 2b clinical trial in subjects with atopic dermatitis, which was initiated in May 2022 and was completed in January 2024. ATI-2138 The decrease in expenses for ATI-2138 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in clinical development expenses associated with a Phase 1 MAD trial which was completed in September 2023, as well as a decrease in preclinical development activities. This decrease was partially offset by clinical development expenses associated with a Phase 2a trial which initiated in August 2024.

 Personnel and stock-based compensation The decrease in personnel and stock-based compensation expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to lower headcount and higher forfeiture credits, partially offset by an increase in termination benefits, as a result of our restructuring that was announced in December 2023. General and Administrative The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Personnel 1,189 1,893 (704) 5,041 5,766 (725) Professional and legal fees 1,854 1,042 812 3,881 4,207 (326) Facility and support services 480 738 (258) 1,676 2,213 (537) Other general and administrative 482 596 (114) 1,554 1,709 (155) Stock-based compensation 1,648 2,529 (881) 5,097 8,989 (3,892) Bad debt 293 (293) 1,314 (1,314) Total general and administrative expenses 5,653 7,091 (1,438) 17,249 24,198 (6,949) Personnel and stock-based compensation The decrease in personnel and stock-based compensation expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to lower headcount and higher forfeiture credits, partially offset by an increase in termination benefits, as a result of our restructuring that was announced in December 2023. Professional and legal fees Professional and legal fees, including accounting, investor relations and corporate communication costs, increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to business development expenses incurred in connection with the royalty purchase agreement with OMERS. Professional and legal fees decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by a decrease in accounting related expenses, which were partially offset by an increase in business development expenses. Facility and support services Facility and support services, including general office expenses, information technology costs and other expenses, decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of a decrease in rent expense and information technology expenses. Bad Debt Bad debt expenses were related to our determination that amounts due to us as of September 30, 2023 pursuant to the asset purchase agreement with EPI Health are uncertain as a result of the bankruptcy filing by EPI Health in July 2023. There was no bad debt expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Licensing The decrease in licensing expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the achievement of higher milestones under

 license agreements during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. Revaluation of Contingent Consideration The revaluation of contingent consideration loss decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 mainly due to adjustments to assumptions for certain clinical programs during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The revaluation of contingent consideration loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to changes in estimated sales levels and changes to the probability of success for certain drug candidates, compared to the gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which was primarily due to changes in discount rates, including risk-free rates and credit spreads, on potential future payments. The gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was partially offset by adjustments to other assumptions for certain clinical programs. Other Income Interest Income Interest income decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to lower interest income on investment portfolio balances. Non-cash Royalty Income Non-cash royalty income was 0.9 million for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Since our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Prior to our acquisition of Confluence, we did not generate any revenue. We have financed our operations over the last several years primarily through sales of our equity securities and incurring indebtedness in the form of loans from commercial lenders. We may engage in additional debt and equity financing transactions in order to raise funds. We may receive royalties and milestone payments under third-party licensing and acquisition agreements. In addition, to the extent we are able to consummate transactions with potential third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates, we may receive upfront payments, milestone payments or royalties from such arrangements that would increase our liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 173.4 million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view towards liquidity and capital preservation. We currently have no ongoing material financing commitments, such as lines of credit or guarantees, that are expected to affect our liquidity, other than our contingent obligations under the Confluence Agreement, which is summarized above under Overview Acquisition and License Agreements, and our lease obligations.

 Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were 47.7 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 39.9 million as of December 31, 2023. We also had 125.7 million in short- and long-term marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 compared to 142.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The sources and uses of cash that contributed to the change in cash and cash equivalents were: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents beginning balance 39,878 45,277 Net cash used in operating activities (11,137) (71,564) Net cash provided by investing activities 18,954 38,670 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (44) 26,657 Cash and cash equivalents ending balance 47,651 39,040 Operating Activities Cash flow related to operating activities was the result of: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Net loss (35,513) (86,990) Non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities 12,460 19,311 Change in accounts payable and accrued expenses (16,730) 5,270 Change in deferred income 24,947 Change in accounts receivable (45) 138 Change in prepaid expenses and other assets 3,744 (9,293) Net cash used in operating activities (11,137) (71,564) Net cash used in operating activities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of lower net losses after adjusting for non-cash items, lower prepayments on vendor contracts and proceeds from the royalty sale to OMERS. This change was partially offset by an increase in cash used for accounts payable and accrued expenses, which was due to the timing of payments to vendors as well as third parties in connection with amounts earned under licensing agreements. Investing Activities Cash flow related to investing activities was the result of: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Purchases of property and equipment (121) (868) Purchases of marketable securities (49,555) (135,675) Proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities 68,630 175,213 Net cash provided by investing activities 18,954 38,670 The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from lower sales and maturities of marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by lower purchases of marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

 32 

Table of Contents 
 Financing Activities Cash flow related to financing activities was the result of: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Proceeds from issuance of common stock under the at-the-market sales agreement, net of issuance costs 26,714 Payments of employee withholding taxes related to restricted stock unit award vesting (76) (102) Proceeds from exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of stock 32 45 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (44) 26,657 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 44 thousand compared to net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 26.7 million. The change was primarily due to proceeds in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from sales under our at-the-market sales agreement. Funding Requirements We anticipate we will incur net losses in the near term as we continue to discover and develop drug candidates. We may not be able to generate revenue from these programs if, among other things, our clinical trials are not successful, the FDA does not approve our drug candidates currently in clinical trials when we expect, or at all, or we are not able to identify and consummate transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates. Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, research and development expenses, laboratory and related supplies, legal and other regulatory expenses, and administrative and overhead costs. Our future funding requirements will be heavily determined by the resources needed to support the development of our drug candidates, without taking into account any potential business development activities resulting from our ongoing strategic review of our business. As a publicly traded company, we incur and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other similar expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, requires public companies to implement specified corporate governance practices that could increase our compliance costs. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are sufficient to fund our operating and capital expenditure requirements for a period greater than 12 months from the date of issuance of our condensed consolidated financial statements that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q based on our current operating assumptions. We will require additional capital to develop our drug candidates and to support our discovery efforts. Additional funds may not be available on a timely basis, on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, and such funds, if raised, may not be sufficient to enable us to continue to implement our long-term business strategy. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potentially worsening global economic conditions caused by a variety of factors including geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital or generate revenue from transactions with potential third-party partners for the development and/or commercialization of our drug candidates, we may need to substantially curtail our planned operations. We may raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities. In such an event, our stockholders ownership will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of a holder of our common stock.

 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research and development of pharmaceutical drugs, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our funding requirements in the near term will depend on many factors, including: the number and development requirements of the drug candidates that we may pursue; the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and conducting preclinical and clinical trials for our drug candidates; the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our drug candidates; the extent to which we in-license or acquire additional drug candidates and technologies; the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; our ability to identify and consummate transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates; and our ability to earn revenue as a result of licenses to, or partnerships or other arrangements with, third parties. Leases We occupy space for our headquarters in Wayne, Pennsylvania under a lease agreement which has a term through February 2029. We also occupy office and laboratory space in St. Louis, Missouri under a sublease agreement which has a term through May 2029. Our aggregate remaining lease payment obligation for these two spaces was 3.4 million as of September 30, 2024. Agreement and Plan of Merger Confluence Under the Confluence Agreement, we have agreed to pay the former Confluence equity holders aggregate remaining contingent consideration of up to 75.0 million based upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones set forth in the Confluence Agreement. In addition, we have agreed to pay the former Confluence equity holders future royalty payments calculated as a low single-digit percentage of annual net sales, subject to specified reductions, limitations and other adjustments, until the date that all of the patent rights for that product have expired, as determined on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis or, in specified circumstances, ten years from the first commercial sale of such product. In addition to the payments described above, if we sell, license or transfer any of the intellectual property acquired from Confluence pursuant to the Confluence Agreement to a third party, we will be obligated to pay the former Confluence equity holders a portion of any consideration received from such sale, license, or transfer in specified circumstances. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of our contingent consideration liability was 10.0 million. R D Obligations We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, contract manufacturing organizations and other service providers for clinical trials, preclinical studies and testing, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination upon notice, and therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material. Segment Information We have two reportable segments, therapeutics and contract research. The therapeutics segment is focused on identifying and developing innovative therapies to address significant unmet needs for immuno-inflammatory diseases and earns revenue through licensing our intellectual property. The contract research segment earns revenue from the provision of laboratory services.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of money market funds, asset-backed debt securities, corporate debt securities, foreign government agency debt securities, U.S. government debt securities and U.S. government agency debt securities. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. Our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. However, due to the short-term nature and low-risk profile of our investment portfolio, we do not expect that an immediate 10 change in market interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our investment portfolio. We have the ability to hold our marketable securities until maturity, and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in exchange rates. Our primary exposure to currency risk is foreign government agency debt securities. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency risk. Due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and other financial instruments, we do not believe an immediate 10 change in currency rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. Inflation Risk Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor. Although inflation in the United States in recent months has remained higher than in previous years, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as set forth in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any other pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. Our risk factors have not changed materially from those described in Part I, Item 1A.
