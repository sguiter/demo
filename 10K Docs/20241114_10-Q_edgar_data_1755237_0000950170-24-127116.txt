CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements in this report, other than statements of historical facts, including statements about future events, financing plans, financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs, plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. Use of the words may, might, will, would, could, should, believes, estimates, projects, potential, expects, plans, seeks, intends, aimed, evaluates, pursues, anticipates, continues, designs, impacts, affects, forecasts, target, outlook, initiative, objective, designed, priorities, goal or the negative of those words or other similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements that represent our current judgment about possible future events, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 
 Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, by their nature, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include regional, national, or global political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory conditions and the following: 
 our plans with respect to the development and licensing of our current product candidates and potential future product candidates we may acquire or license and associated timing thereof, including the design and results of pre-clinical and clinical studies; 

there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern; 

our ability to enter into collaboration or license agreements of our current product candidates and potential future product candidates; 

the timing, investment and associated activities involved in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, launching and commercializing our current and potential future product candidates; 

the risks in our investment in Tisento tied to Tisento developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, launching and commercializing its product candidates; 

the uncertainty as to any liquidity or monetizable value of our equity interest in Tisento, which faces all the risks of an early-stage pharmaceutical development company; 

our relationships with third parties, collaborators and our employees; our ability to execute our strategic priorities; 

our ability to finance our operations and business initiatives; 

maintaining our Nasdaq listing; 

our ability to access capital, capabilities, and transactions necessary to advance the development of our current product candidates and potential future product candidates; 

whether any development, regulatory, and commercialization milestones or royalty payments provided for in the agreement with Akebia will be achieved; 

the impact on our business of workforce and expense reduction initiatives; 

the safety profile and related adverse events of our current and potential future product candidates; 

the efficacy and perceived therapeutic benefits of any potential future product candidates we may acquire or license, their potential indications and their market potential; 

U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory requirements, including any post-approval development and regulatory requirements, and the ability of our potential future product candidates to meet such requirements; 

3 

our ability to obtain reimbursement from the U.S. government and third-party payors for potential future product candidates if and when commercialized; 

our ability to attract and retain employees needed to execute our business plans and strategies and our ability to manage the impact of any loss of key employees; 

our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our current and potential future product candidates and the strength thereof; 

the risk that third parties may allege we infringe their intellectual property rights; 

our future financial performance, revenues, expense levels, payments, cash flows, profitability, tax obligations, capital raising and liquidity sources, and concentration of voting control, as well as the timing and drivers thereof, and internal control over financial reporting; 

trends and challenges in the markets for any potential product candidates; 

a determination that we constitute an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and if we are required to register thereunder, which could have a material adverse effect on us; 

our ability to compete with other companies that are or may be developing or selling products that are competitive with any potential future product candidates; 

the impact of any pandemic or natural disaster to disrupt our business, including our development activities; and 

the impact of government regulation in the life sciences industry, particularly with respect to healthcare reform. 

See the Risk Factors section in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 5, 2024 for a further description of these and other factors. We caution you that the risks, uncertainties, and other factors referenced above may not contain all of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results, benefits, or developments that we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our business in the way expected. There can be no assurance that (i) we have correctly measured or identified all of the factors affecting our business or the extent of these factors likely impact, (ii) the available information with respect to these factors on which such analysis is based is complete or accurate, (iii) such analysis is correct or (iv) our strategy, which is based in part on this analysis, will be successful. All forward-looking statements in this report apply only as of the date of this report or as of the date they were made and, except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

 million in total potential future development, regulatory, and commercialization milestone payments. Cyclerion is also eligible to receive tiered, sales-based royalties ranging from single-digit to high-teen percentages and subject to reduction upon expiration of patent rights or the launch of a generic product. Olinciguat is a Phase 2 orally administered, once-daily, vascular sGC stimulator that Cyclerion intends to out-license to an entity with strong cardiovascular and/or cardiopulmonary capabilities. Zagociguat is a clinical-stage CNS-penetrant sGC stimulator that has shown rapid improvement in cerebral blood flow, functional brain connectivity, brain response to visual stimulus, cognitive performance, and biomarkers associated mitochondrial function and inflammation in clinical studies. CY3018 is a CNS-targeted sGC stimulator that preferentially localizes to the brain and has a pharmacology profile that suggests its potential for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases and disorders. On July 28, 2023, the Company sold zagociguat and CY3018 to Tisento Therapeutics, Inc. Tisento ), a newly formed private company focused on their development, in exchange for million in cash consideration, million as reimbursement for certain operating expenses related to zagociguat and CY3018 for the period between signing and closing of the transaction, and of all of Tisento s parent s outstanding equity securities. See Asset Purchase Agreement and Note 4 below. Cyclerion is actively evaluating other activities aimed at enhancing shareholder value, which may potentially include collaborations, licenses, mergers, acquisitions and/or other targeted investments. The Company has shifted its strategy to identify, non-sGC stimulator assets within the CNS therapeutic area to build a new portfolio. If the Company identifies and acquires or licenses suitable new assets, the Company will seek to develop the new assets and retain contract research, development and manufacturing organizations for these specific purposes. Additionally, Cyclerion plans to seek to raise funds for further research and development activities associated with any new assets. The Company s goal is to find the best combination of capital, capabilities, and transactions that will enable the advancement of current and any future assets the Company may acquire for patients in a way that maximizes shareholder value. Cyclerion GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary, was incorporated in Zug, Switzerland on May 3, 2019. The functional currency is the Swiss franc. The liquidation process for Cyclerion GmbH has been concluded and the subsidiary was de-registered in May 2024.

employees. Stock Purchase Agreement In March 2023, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with the Company's former Chief Executive Officer (the Former CEO pursuant to which he invested million in cash for shares of common stock and shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company at a price of per share (after giving effect to the 1-for-20 reverse stock split the Company implemented on May 15, 2023). Such Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of the Company's common stock on a one-to-one basis. The closing of the equity investment took place on May 19, 2023, and (to comply with Nasdaq listing requirements) the Company's shareholders approved such convertibility on July 19, 2023. Asset Purchase Agreement On May 11, 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement with an investor group that included the Former CEO, JW Celtics Investment Corp and JW Cycle Inc. which subsequently changed their names to Tisento Therapeutics Holdings Inc. Tisento Parent and Tisento. Upon the closing on July 28, 2023, of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company sold to Tisento specified assets relating to the Company s zagociguat and CY3018 programs (the "Transferred Assets") and Tisento assumed certain liabilities relating thereto, including, but not limited to (i) liabilities, costs and expenses arising after the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement relating to the employment of certain Cyclerion employees and the conduct of certain preclinical and clinical trial activities prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, and (ii) liabilities relating to such assets to the extent relating to the period after the closing of the transaction. In consideration for such sale and assumption, at such closing the Company received proceeds of 8.0 million as cash consideration, 2.4 million as reimbursement for certain operating expenses related to such assets for the period between signing and closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement, and shares of common stock of Tisento Parent comprising 10 of the then issued and outstanding equity securities of Tisento Parent immediately following such closing, subject to certain protections against dilution. Reverse Stock Split On May 15, 2023, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to the Company's Restated Articles of Organization with the Secretary of Commonwealth of Massachusetts to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The reverse stock split was reflected on the Nasdaq Capital Market beginning with the opening of trading on May 16, 2023. All share amounts and per share amounts disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented. At-the-Market Offering On July 24, 2020, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the Shelf ). On September 3, 2020, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with Jefferies LLC Jefferies with respect to an at-the-market offering (the ATM Offering under the Shelf. Under the ATM Offering, the Company could offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to million through Jefferies as its sales agent. The Company agreed to pay Jefferies cash commissions of percent of the gross proceeds of sales of common stock which could be sold under the Sales Agreement. Prior to January 1, 2022, the Company sold shares of its common stock for net proceeds of million under the ATM Offering, since entering into the Sales Agreement. shares of common stock have been issued or sold under the ATM Offering from January 1, 2022 to July 31, 2023. The Shelf expired in July 31, 2023. Due to the current market value of the Company's publicly traded common stock held by non-affiliates, the Company's ability to raise future funding though a shelf offering will be limited.

Going Concern At each reporting period, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 205-40, Going Concern, the Company evaluates whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company s evaluation entails analyzing prospective operating budgets and forecasts for expectations of the Company s cash needs and comparing those needs to the current cash and cash equivalent balances. The Company is required to make certain additional disclosures if it concludes substantial doubt exists and it is not alleviated by the Company s plans or when its plans alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management s plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. In performing its analysis, management excluded certain elements of its operating plan that cannot be considered probable. Under ASC 205-40, the future receipt of potential funding from future partnerships, license payments, equity or debt issuances, certain cost reduction measures and the achievement of potential milestone payments from Akebia cannot be considered probable at this time because these plans are not entirely within the Company s control and/or have not been approved by the Board of Directors as of the date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 , will be sufficient to fund operations through mid-2025, however the Company will need to obtain additional funding to sustain operations as it expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company's expectation to generate negative operating cash flows in the future and the need for additional funding to support its planned operations, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include reduced spending, and the pursuit of additional capital. Management has concluded the likelihood that its plan to successfully obtain sufficient funding, or adequately reduce expenditures, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the

If the Optionee exercises the Option during the Option Period, the Parties shall promptly commence negotiations of the definitive license agreement. The terms of the license agreement will be negotiated in good faith within a period not to exceed 90 days after the date of exercise of the Option. If the parties cannot reach agreement, all rights revert to the Company. In addition, the Optionee has agreed to reimburse the Company for certain patent expenses incurred during the Option period. The Company recognized revenue of million related to the Option fee payment and expense reimbursement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Akebia License Agreement On June 3, 2021, the Company and Akebia entered into a License Agreement (the Akebia License Agreement relating to the exclusive worldwide license by the Company to Akebia of the Company's rights to the development, manufacture, medical affairs and commercialization of pharmaceutical products containing the pharmaceutical compound known as praliciguat and other related products and forms thereof enumerated in the 

 20 

million up-front payment to the Company upon signing of the License Agreement and the Company is eligible to receive additional milestone cash payments of up to million in total potential future development, regulatory, and commercialization milestone payments for praliciguat. In addition to these cash milestone payments, if Akebia commercializes the licensed technology, Akebia will pay the Company tiered royalty payments on net sales in certain major markets at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the high-teens, subject to certain reductions and offsets. Pursuant to the Akebia License Agreement, the Company determined the Akebia License Agreement represents a service arrangement under the scope of ASC 606. Given the reversion of the rights under the Akebia License Agreement represents a penalty in substance for a termination by Akebia, the contract term would be the stated term of the License Agreement. The Company determined that the grant of license to its patents and trademarks, know how transfer, the assignment of regulatory submissions and trademarks and additional knowledge transfer assistance obligations represent a single promise and performance obligation to be transferred to Akebia over time due to the nature of the promises in the contract. The provision of development materials on hand was identified as a separate performance obligation. However, it is immaterial in the context of the contract as the development materials are low value and do not have an alternative use to the Company. The consideration related to sales-based milestone payments, including royalties, will be recognized when the related sales occur as these amounts have been determined to relate predominantly to the license. The Company will re-evaluate the probability of achievement of the milestones and any related constraints each reporting period. Akebia Supply Agreement On August 3, 2021, the Company and Akebia entered into a Supply Agreement (the Supply Agreement relating to the manufacturing by the Company of the Initial Supply of the Drug Product and placebo ("Initial Supply") for Akebia's use pursuant to the Akebia License Agreement. Akebia will pay the Company for the manufacturing costs at mutually agreed upon rates. The Company determined the Supply Agreement has stand-alone value under the scope of ASC 606 and should not be combined with the Akebia License Agreement. Given that the Supply Agreement can be terminated at any time without cause with 30 days notice, the Company deemed the Supply Agreement to be a month-to-month contract. The manufacturing of the Initial Supply by the Company represents a single performance obligation and consideration related to the manufacturing costs will be recognized over time as costs are incurred. There was revenue recognized as part of the Supply Agreement in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 .

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Forward-Looking Information 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the audited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those referenced or set forth under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 
 Overview 
 We operate in one reportable business segment human therapeutics. 
 At inception, Cyclerion was a biopharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of serious diseases with novel soluble guanylate cyclase sGC stimulators in both the central nervous system CNS and the periphery. The nitric oxide NO sGC cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP signaling pathway is a fundamental mechanism that precisely controls key aspects of physiology throughout the body. The NO-sGC-cGMP pathway regulates diverse and critical biological functions in both the CNS and the periphery and has been successfully targeted with several drugs. Prior to the sale of two assets to Tisento (see below), Cyclerion s portfolio included novel sGC stimulators that modulate signaling networks in both the CNS and the periphery. 
 On July 28, 2023, we sold two of our CNS assets (zagociguat and CY3018, or the Transferred Assets to Tisento in exchange for 8.0 million in cash consideration, 2.4 million as reimbursement for certain operating expenses related to zagociguat and CY3018 for the period between signing and closing of the transaction, and 10 of all of Tisento's Parent's outstanding equity securities. The Cyclerion assets that were retained are olinciguat and praliciguat which are not CNS focused and are either currently out-licensed (praliciguat) or management is seeking to out-license (olinciguat). 
 We have shifted our strategy to identify non-sGC stimulator assets, mainly within the CNS therapeutic area, to build a new portfolio. If the Company identifies suitable new assets, the Company will seek to develop the new assets and retain contract research and development and seek to outsource to manufacturing organizations for these specific purposes, as well as seek to raise funds for further research and development activities. The Company s goal is to find the best combination of capital, capabilities, and transactions that will enable the advancement of current and any future assets the Company may acquire for patients in a way that maximizes shareholder value. 
 Financial Overview 
 Research and Development Expense. Research and development expenses are incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. These expenses consist primarily of the following costs: compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, research and development related facilities, third-party contracts relating to manufacturing, nonclinical studies and clinical trial activities. All research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred. 
 Praliciguat is an orally administered, once-daily systemic sGC stimulator. On June 3, 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Akebia relating to the exclusive worldwide license to Akebia of our rights to the development, manufacture, medical affairs and commercialization of pharmaceutical products containing praliciguat and other related products and forms thereof enumerated in such agreement. Cyclerion is eligible to receive up to 585 million in total potential future development, regulatory, and commercialization milestone payments. Cyclerion is also eligible to receive tiered, sales-based royalties ranging from single-digit to high-teen percentages and subject to reduction upon expiration of patent rights or the launch of a generic product. 
 22 

Olinciguat is a Phase 2 orally administered, once-daily, vascular sGC stimulator that Cyclerion intends to out-license to an entity with strong cardiovascular and/or cardiopulmonary capabilities. On July 22, 2024, we entered into an Option to License Agreement (the Option Agreement with a third party (the Optionee ), pursuant to which the Optionee has an option (the Option to enter into an exclusive license to olinciguat for human therapeutics, subject to certain carveouts. Under the terms of the Option Agreement, the Optionee paid the Company an Option fee of 150,000 in August 2024. The Optionee may exercise the Option on or before February 22, 2025, which may be extended for an additional two-month period for an additional fee of 25,000. If the Optionee exercises the Option during the Option Period, the Parties shall promptly commence negotiations of the definitive license agreement. The terms of the license agreement will be negotiated in good faith within a period not to exceed 90 days after the date of exercise of the Option. If the parties cannot reach agreement, all rights revert to the Company. In addition, the Optionee has agreed to reimburse the Company for certain patent expenses incurred during the Option period. 
 Zagociguat and CY3018 are orally administered CNS-penetrant sGC stimulators. On July 28, 2023, Tisento purchased zagociguat and CY3018 in exchange for 8.0 million in cash consideration, 2.4 million as reimbursement for certain operating expenses related to zagociguat and CY3018 for the period between signing and closing of the transaction, and 10 of all of Tisento Parent's outstanding equity securities at the time of closing. 
 Cyclerion continues to evaluate other activities aimed at enhancing shareholder value, which may potentially include collaborations, licenses, mergers, acquisitions, and/or other targeted investments. 
 The following table summarizes our research and development expenses, employee and facility related costs allocated to research and development expense, and discovery and pre-clinical phase programs, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The product pipeline expenses relate primarily to external costs associated with nonclinical studies and clinical trial costs.

Securing regulatory approvals for new drugs is a lengthy and costly process. Any failure by us or our partners to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product candidate development efforts and our business overall. 
 Given the inherent uncertainties of pharmaceutical product development, we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty how our programs will evolve, and therefore the amount of time or money that would be required to obtain regulatory approval to market them. As a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals, we are currently unable to estimate precisely when, if ever, our discovery and development candidates will be approved. 
 The successful development of any current or potential future product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks. Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We are unable to determine the duration and costs to complete current or future nonclinical and clinical stages of any current or potential future product candidates, including as licensed to third parties, or when, or to what extent, we may generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any current or potential future product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the data from the studies of each product candidate, the competitive landscape and ongoing assessments of such product candidate s commercial potential. 
 23 

General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses for personnel in our administrative, finance, legal, information technology, business development, and human resource functions. Other costs include the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, general and administrative related facility costs, insurance costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services. We record all general and administrative expenses as incurred. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the amounts of expenses during the reported periods. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known. 
 We believe that our application of accounting policies requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management and is the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 All research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. We defer and capitalize nonrefundable advance payments we make for research and development activities until the related goods are received or the related services are performed. A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates may be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. 
 Results of Operations 
 The revenue and expenses reflected in the consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of revenue and expenses that will be incurred by us in the future. The following discussion summarizes the key factors we believe are necessary for an understanding of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue 
 Revenue from option agreement. On July 22, 2024, we entered into the Option Agreement with the Optionee, which the Optionee has the Option to enter into an exclusive license to olinciguat for human therapeutics, subject to certain carveouts. We recognized revenue of 0.2 million related to the Option fee payment and expense reimbursement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Expenses 
 Research and development expense. We had further reductions of workforce in 2023 in connection with the sale of the Transferred Assets to Tisento and change to the Company s strategy. The decrease in research and development expense of approximately 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by decreases of approximately 0.3 million in employee-related expenses primarily due to the workforce reduction in 2023 and a decrease of approximated of 0.2 million in other miscellaneous expenses including professional consulting expense, research study costs and outside service fees. 
 The decrease in research and development expense of approximately 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by decreases of approximately 0.5 million in employee-related expenses primarily due to the workforce reduction in 2023, approximately 0.2 million in information technology services, approximately 0.1 million in research study costs, approximately 0.1 million in outside service fee, approximately 0.2 million in lab equipment and service and approximately 0.1 million in lab space rent. 
 General and administrative expense. The decrease in general and administrative expenses of approximately 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by decreases of approximately 0.2 million in employee-related expenses primarily due to the workforce reduction in 2023, approximately 0.1 million in board member fees, approximately 0.1 million in outside service fee, approximately 0.4 million in legal services and approximately 0.1 million in audit service. 
 The decrease in general and administrative expenses of approximately 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by 
 25 

decreases of approximately 0.3 million in employee-related expenses primarily due to the workforce reduction in 2023, approximately 1.4 million in legal services, approximately 0.2 million in audit and tax services, approximately 0.2 million in outside services, 0.3 million in insurance expenses and approximately 0.3 million in information technology services, offset by an increase of approximately of 0.4 million in professional consulting. 
 Impairment loss. The impairment loss consists of an impairment loss of operating lease of approximately 3.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was no impairment loss recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest income. Interest income decreased by 0.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to the decrease of our money market fund balance. 
 Gain from settlement of account payable. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reached a settlement agreement with a vendor for a disputed account payable and recorded a gain of 0.4 million on settlement of account payable. 
 Gain from discontinued operations. The decrease in gain from discontinued operations of approximately 13.5 million and 7.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, was driven by the sale of Transferred Assets in July 2023. After the sale of Transferred Assets, no discontinued operation was recognized in the income statements. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 On July 24, 2020, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the Shelf with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC in relation to the registration of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units of any combination thereof for an aggregate initial offering price not to exceed 150.0 million. On September 3, 2020, we entered into the Sales Agreement with Jefferies with respect to the ATM Offering under the Shelf. The Shelf expired in July 2023. We did not sell any shares of our common stock under the Shelf from January 1, 2022 to July 2023. 
 On May 19, 2023, we sold 225,000 shares of our common stock, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, and 351,037 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, to our former CEO, for total gross proceeds of approximately 5 million. There were no material fees or commissions related to the transaction. Such Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of our common stock on a one-to-one basis. Our shareholders approved such convertibility on July 19, 2023. 
 On July 28, 2023, we closed the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement receiving proceeds of 8.0 million as cash consideration, approximately 2.4 million as reimbursement for certain operating expenses related to zagociguat and CY3018 programs for the period between signing and closing of the transaction, and 10 of all of Tisento Parent s outstanding equity securities. 
 Our ability to continue to fund our operations and meet capital needs in the next twelve months will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets and other sources of capital, as further described below. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be primarily to fund our operations, working capital needs, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. 
 On September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2.9 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents include amounts held in U.S. government money market funds. We invest cash in excess of immediate requirements in accordance with our investment policy, which requires all investments held by us to be at least AAA rated or equivalent, with a remaining final maturity when purchased of less than twelve months, so as to primarily achieve liquidity and capital preservation. 
 Going Concern 
 We evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these consolidated financial 
 26 

statements are issued. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of our plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management s plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. In performing our analysis, management excluded certain elements of our operating plan that cannot be considered probable. Under ASC 205-40, the future receipt of potential funding from future partnerships, equity or debt issuances, and the potential milestones from the Akebia agreement cannot be considered probable at this time because these plans are not entirely within our control and/or have not been approved by the Board of Directors as of the date of these consolidated financial statements. 
 We have incurred recurring losses since our inception, including a net loss of 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 268.0 million. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to fund operations into mid-2025, however we will need to obtain additional funding to sustain operations as we expect to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above. 
 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 On May 15, 2023, we filed Articles of Amendment to our Restated Articles of Organization with the Secretary of Commonwealth of Massachusetts to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The reverse stock split was reflected on the Nasdaq Capital Market beginning with the opening of trading on May 16, 2023. All share amounts and per share amounts disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following is a summary of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of our 3.6 million net loss from operations. The net loss was offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 0.5 million. The net loss was also adjusted by gain from settlement of accounts payable of 0.4 million, an increase in prepaid expense of 0.2 million, a decrease in accounts payable of 0.5 million and a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 0.5 million. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 19.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of our 3.6 million net loss from operations. The net loss was offset by impairment loss of 3.3 
 27 

million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 1.0 million, a decrease in account receivable of 0.1 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses of 0.1 million, a decrease in other current assets of 0.1 million, a decrease in operating lease assets of 0.1 million and a decrease in other assets of 0.2 million. The net loss was also adjusted by gain on disposal of discontinued operations of 15.8 million, a decrease in account payable of 2.2 million, a decrease in accrued research and development costs of 1.9 million and a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 1.2 million. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 There was no investing activity incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 10.4 million was due to cash proceeds received from the disposal of discontinued operations of approximately 10.4 million. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 There was no financing activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 5.0 million was due to cash received from the May 2023 stock purchase agreement of 5 million. 
 Funding Requirements 
 We expect our expenses to fluctuate as we continue to maintain out-license opportunities and seek to broaden our portfolio through in-licensing of assets. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to fund operations into mid-2025, however we will need to obtain additional funding to sustain operations as we expect to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. Failure to obtain necessary capital when needed may delay development of any current or potential future product candidates, or other operations. Additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all to continue as a going concern and advance our current and any potential future product candidates. Failure to obtain capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations. Raising additional capital may dilute our existing shareholders, restrict our operations or cause us to relinquish valuable rights. 
 Because of the many risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our expenses will fluctuate, and our future funding requirements will depend on, and could increase or decrease significantly as a result of many factors, including the: 
 scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 

costs of future activities, including medical affairs, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 

cost and timing of necessary actions to support our strategic objectives; 

costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; and 

timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or milestone payments related to or royalties on, our current or future product candidates, if any. 

A change in any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any current or potential future product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing of the development of that product candidate. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances 
 28 

or licensing arrangements with third parties, of which there can be no assurance. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, outstanding equity ownership may be materially diluted, and the terms of securities sold in such transactions could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. In addition, debt financing would result in increased fixed payment obligations. 
 If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, as to which raise there can be no assurances, we may have to relinquish rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise funds, we may need to cease operations. 
 Contractual Commitments and Obligations 
 Tax-related Obligations 
 We exclude assets, liabilities or obligations pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual commitments and obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. As of September 30, 2024, we had no uncertain tax positions. 
 Separation Benefits 
 As part of the separation benefit of the former Chief Financial Officer, we paid 0.1 million in May 2024 and August 2024, as the former Chief Financial Officer had not secured full-time employment prior to the six-month anniversary and nine-month anniversary of November 15, 2023. We have no further separation benefits obligation as of September 30, 2024. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. We enter into guarantees in the ordinary course of business related to the guarantee of our own performance. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing 
 29 

similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, as opposed to absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of the end of the period covered by this report. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not a party to any material legal proceedings at this time. From time to time we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Not applicable as we are a smaller reporting company . You should carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results set forth under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
