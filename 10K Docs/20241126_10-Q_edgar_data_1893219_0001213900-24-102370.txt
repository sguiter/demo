in its operating bank accounts and a working capital deficit of . 

In connection with the Company s assessment
of going concern considerations in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ASC Topic 205-40 Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, management has determined
the future viability of the Company is largely dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to finance its operations. The Company
expects to seek additional funding through equity and debt financings, collaboration agreements and research grants. Although the Company
has been successful in raising capital in the past, there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such additional financing
on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce
or eliminate its research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect
its business prospects. 

Accordingly, based on the considerations discussed above, management
has concluded there is substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date
the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may require initiating steps
to slow cash burn, extending the cash runway until financing can be secured. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments with respect to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their classification that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

The
impact of current conflicts around the globe, including Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, and related sanctions,
on the world economy is not determinable as of the date of these financial statements, and the specific impact on the Company s
financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. 

Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 

On
August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides
for, among other things, a new U.S. federal excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations
and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax
is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax
is generally of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating
the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair
market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department
of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent
the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. 

Any
redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or
otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection
with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value
of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with a Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business
Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination
(or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination)
and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by
the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing
could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and impact the Company s ability to complete
a Business Combination. 

During the second quarter, the IRS issued final regulations with respect
to the timing and payment of the excise tax. Pursuant to those regulations, the Company would need to file a return and remit payment
for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 on or before October 31, 2024. The Company
has filed the excise tax return and has engaged the IRS in determining a payment plan for the balance.

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated
in Delaware on May 20, 2021 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization,
or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We may pursue a Business Combination target in any industry or sector, but
given the experience of our management team, we expect to focus on acquiring a business combination target within the financial services
industry and related sectors, including potentially the mobility sector. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from
the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of
cash, stock and debt.

in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 13,850,000. 

Transaction costs amounted to 17,204,107
consisting of 5,760,000 of underwriting discount (net of 240,000 reimbursed by the underwriters), 10,500,000 of deferred underwriting
fees, and 944,107 of other offering costs. We have agreed to pay a deferred underwriting fee to the underwriters upon the consummation
of a Business Combination in an amount equal to, in the aggregate, 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering or an aggregate
of 10,500,000. 

The Company and the underwriters have
agreed the underwriters will be entitled to 600,000 shares of common stock in deferred underwriting fees contingent on completion of the
Merger. 

The promissory note issued in connection
with unsecured loans from our Sponsor to finance our liquidity needs through the consummation of our Initial Public Offering was non-interest
bearing and the aggregate amount of 149,539 outstanding under the promissory note as of January 19, 2022 was fully repaid on February 22,
2022. 

Following the Initial Public Offering,
the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, a total of 306,000,000 was placed in the
Trust Account. We incurred 17,204,107 in Initial Public Offering related costs, including 5,760,000 of underwriting fees and 944,107
of other costs. On April 18, 2023, the company held the Meeting and as a result 26,564,308 shares of the Company s Series A
common stock were redeemed at approximately 10.41 per share. On December 13, 2023, stockholders holding a total of 2,768,301 public
shares of Series A common stock exercised and did not reverse, their right to redeem their public shares in connection with the vote upon
the Charter Amendment Proposal. As a result of the foregoing, those holders will receive a payment of approximately 10.68 per share redeemed. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash
held in the Trust Account of 7,721,206 29,728,990 was redeemed and withdrawn in January 2024). Interest income on the balance in the
Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through September 30, 2024, we have withdrawn an amount of 308,332,719 which consists
of 306,200,450 attributable to redemptions and 2,132,269 attributable to withdrawals to pay tax obligations. 

To mitigate the risk
of us being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A)
of the Investment Company Act), the Company instructed the Trustee in December 29, 2023 to liquidate the U.S. government securities
or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash (which may include demand
deposit accounts) until the earlier of consummation of a Business Combination or liquidation. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash
of 13,597. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business
due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure,
negotiate and complete a Business Combination. 

In order to fund working capital deficiencies
or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor has committed to provide us 1,750,000 to fund our
expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target business and other working capital requirements. In addition, our Sponsor, or
certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us additional funds as may be required.
If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we
may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account
would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business
Combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. 

27 

On October 14, 2023 and November 14,
2023, the Company issued the Extension Promissory Notes to the Sponsor. The 80,000 of cash proceeds was deposited into the Company s
trust account in order to extend the amount of time that the Company has available to complete a Business Combination. Upon the closing
of a Business Combination by the Company, the Sponsor may elect to either receive repayment under the Extension Promissory Notes or to
convert all or a portion of the amount loaned under the Extension Promissory Notes into Series A common stock of the Company at a price
equal to 10.20 per share. In the event that the Company does not complete a Business Combination, the amounts loaned under the Extension
Promissory Notes will be repaid to the Sponsor only from funds held outside the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated, or otherwise
forgiven. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owed 160,000 due under the Extension Promissory Notes with
no further borrowings available. 

On December 18, 2023, the Company
amended the Extension Promissory Notes to remove the Sponsors right to convert the note into Series A common stock at a price equal to
 10.20 per share. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, the Sponsor advanced the Company 2,270,051 and 1,655,000, respectively, and is reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheets. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 775,992. Net loss of 1,722,675 was affected by interest earned on cash and marketable
securities held in the Trust Account of 258,756. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 1,205,439 of cash for operating
activities. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2023, cash used in operating activities was 1,506,562. Net income of 2,828,701 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities
held in the Trust Account of 5,279,395. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 944,132 of cash for operating activities. 

Going Concern 

In connection with the Company s assessment
of going concern considerations in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ASC Topic 205-40 Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, management has determined
the future viability of the Company is largely dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to finance its operations. The Company
expects to seek additional funding through equity and debt financings, collaboration agreements and research grants. Although the Company
has been successful in raising capital in the past, there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such additional financing
on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce
or eliminate its research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect
its business prospects. 

Accordingly, based on the considerations discussed above, management
has concluded there is substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date
the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may require initiating steps
to slow cash burn, extending the cash runway until financing can be secured. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments with respect to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their classification that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

28 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets or liabilities,
which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established
for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements,
established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term debt,
capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than the following: 

The underwriters were entitled to a
cash underwriting discount of 0.20 per Unit, or 6,000,000 in the aggregate, paid on the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition,
the underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 0.35 per Unit, or 10,500,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable
to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to
the terms of the underwriting agreement. The Company and the underwriters have agreed the underwriters will be entitled to 600,000 shares
of common stock in deferred underwriting fees contingent on completion of the Merger. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements
and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. We have
identified the following critical accounting policies: 

Common Stock Subject to Possible
Redemption 

We account for our common stock subject
to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Common
stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common
stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption
upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock
is classified as a component of stockholders equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to
be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption
is presented at redemption value as temporary equity outside of the stockholders equity section of our balance sheets. 

Warrants 

We account for warrants as either equity-classified
or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance
in ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial
instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements
for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to our own ordinary shares, among other conditions
for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance
and as of each subsequent reporting period date while the warrants are outstanding. Based on our assessment of the guidance, our warrants
meet the criteria for equity classification and are recorded within stockholders deficit. 

Net (Loss) Income Per Common
Share 

Net (loss) income per common stock
is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Accretion associated
with the redeemable shares of Series A common stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. 

29 

Recent Accounting Standards 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which will require the
Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling
items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by
federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 will become
effective for Annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is still reviewing the impact of ASU 2023-09. 

Management does not believe that any
other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial
statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not required for smaller reporting
companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024,
as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the Company not filing timely tax returns and utilizing cash withdrawn
from the trust account for tax obligations for operating purposes. 

We do not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.
Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances
of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 

There was no change in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter of 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

30 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

None 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

We have identified ineffective
disclosure controls and procedures that, if unsuccessfully remediated, could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results
on a timely and accurate basis and to consummate an initial business combination. 

Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the Company
not filing timely tax returns and utilizing cash withdrawn from the Trust Account for tax obligations for operating purposes. Failure
to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results
on a timely and accurate basis and to consummate an initial business combination. We may also identify material weaknesses or other deficiencies
in our disclosure controls and procedures in the future. Any material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our control systems may affect
our ability to comply with SEC reporting requirements and listing standards or cause our financial statements to contain material misstatements
which could negatively affect market price and trading liquidity of our common stock. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

On October 25, 2021, we issued
7,187,500 shares of our Series B common stock, to our Sponsor for 25,000 in cash, at a purchase price of approximately 0.035 per
share (or 0.0033 per share, after giving effect to a 1.044-for-1 stock split on January 13, 2022), in connection with our formation.
Such shares were issued in connection with our organization pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act. On January 13, 2022, we effectuated a 1.044-for-1 stock split, resulting in an aggregate of 7,503,750 Founder
Shares outstanding and held by our Initial Stockholders. On January 18, 2022, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment
option and the remaining unexercised portion of over-allotment option were forfeited, an aggregate of 3,750 Founder Shares were forfeited,
resulting in an aggregate of 7,500,000 Founder Shares outstanding held by our Initial Stockholders. 

On January 13, 2022, we consummated
the Initial Public Offering of 30,000,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one share of Series A common stock and one-half of a redeemable
warrant, each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Series A common stock for 11.50 per share. The Units
were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of 300,000,000. Cantor Fitzgerald Co. acted
as sole book-running manager. The securities sold in the Initial Public Offering were registered under the Securities Act on a Registration
Statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-261459), which was declared effective by the SEC on January 13, 2022. 

Simultaneously with the closing of
our Initial Public Offering, we consummated a Private Placement of 13,850,000 private placement warrants, at a price of 1.00 per Private
Placement Warrant, to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 13,850,000. Such securities were issued pursuant to the exemption from
registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

Following the closing of our Initial
Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, an aggregate amount of 306,000,000 10.20 per unit) was placed in a
Trust Account. 

Transaction costs amounted to 17,204,107,
consisting of 5,760,000 in underwriting discount (net of 240,000 reimbursed by the underwriters), 10,500,000 in deferred underwriting
discount and 944,107 of other offering costs. In addition, 1,819,051 of cash is held outside of the Trust Account and is available for
the payment of offering costs and for working capital purposes as of the Initial Public Offering date. 

For a description of the use of the
proceeds generated in our Initial Public Offering, see Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q.
