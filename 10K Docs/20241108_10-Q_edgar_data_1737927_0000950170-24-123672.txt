In addition, the exercise or conversion price and/or the number of common shares issuable under any of the Company s outstanding convertible securities, were proportionately adjusted in connection with the Share Consolidation. All issued and outstanding common shares, per share amounts, and outstanding equity instruments and awards exercisable into common shares, as well as the exchange ratios for the Fixed Shares (as defined below) and the Floating Shares (as defined below) in connection with the Acreage Amended Arrangement (as defined below) and the Floating Share Arrangement (as defined below), respectively, contained in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements of the Company and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation for all prior periods presented.

of the total issued and outstanding Canopy USA Class B Shares following such issuance. Accordingly, as a result of the Reorganization Amendments, in no circumstances will the Company, at the time of such conversions, own more than of the Canopy USA Class B Shares. In connection with the Reorganization Amendments, on May 19, 2023, Canopy USA and Huneeus 2017 Irrevocable Trust (the Trust entered into a share purchase agreement (the Trust SPA ), which sets out the terms of the Trust s investment in Canopy USA in the aggregate amount of up to US million (the Trust Transaction ). Agustin Huneeus, Jr. is the trustee of the Trust and is an affiliate of a shareholder of Jetty. Pursuant to the terms of the Trust SPA, the Trust will, subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the Trust SPA be issued common shares of Canopy USA (the Canopy USA Common Shares in two tranches with an aggregate value of up to US million along with warrants of Canopy USA to acquire additional Canopy USA Common Shares. In addition, subject to the terms of the Trust SPA, the Trust has also been granted options to acquire additional Voting Shares (as defined in the A R LLC Agreement) with a value of up to an additional US million and one such additional option includes the issuance of additional warrants of Canopy USA. On April 26, 2024, Canopy USA completed the first tranche closing of the Trust Transaction in accordance with the Trust SPA. As of November 7, 2024, the Trust holds an aggregate Canopy USA Common Shares and warrants to acquire up to Voting Shares expiring on . In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of the A R Protection Agreement (as defined below) and the terms of the option agreements to acquire Wana (as defined below) and Jetty (as defined below), as applicable, Canopy Growth may be required to issue additional common shares in satisfaction of certain deferred and/or option exercise payments to the shareholders of Wana and Jetty. Canopy Growth will receive additional Non-Voting Shares from Canopy USA as consideration for any Company common shares issued in the future to the shareholders of Wana and Jetty. On November 3, 2023, the Company received a letter from the staff of the SEC (the Staff in which the Staff indicated that, despite the Reorganization Amendments, it would object to the deconsolidation of the financial results of Canopy USA from the Company's financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP once Canopy USA acquires Wana, Jetty or the Fixed Shares of Acreage Holdings, Inc. Acreage ). The Company subsequently had discussions with the Office of Chief Accountant of the SEC (the OCA and determined to make certain additional amendments to the structure of Canopy USA (the Additional Reorganization Amendments to facilitate the deconsolidation of Canopy USA from the financial results of Canopy Growth in accordance with U.S. GAAP upon Canopy USA s acquisition of Wana, Jetty or Acreage. In connection with the Additional Reorganization Amendments, Canopy USA and its members entered into a second amended and restated limited liability company agreement (the Second A R LLC Agreement ). In accordance with the Second A R LLC Agreement, the terms of the Non-Voting Shares have been amended such that the Non-Voting Shares are only convertible into Canopy USA Class B Shares following the date that the NASDAQ Stock Market or The New York Stock Exchange permit the listing of companies that consolidate the financial statements of companies that cultivate, distribute or possess marijuana (as defined in 21 U.S.C 802) in the United States (the Stock Exchange Permissibility Date ). Based on the Company s discussions with the OCA, upon effectuating the Additional Reorganization Amendments, the Company believes that the Staff would not object to the deconsolidation of the financial results of Canopy USA from the Company s financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Part 1 - Business Overview 
 We are a world-leading cannabis company which produces, distributes, and sells a diverse range of cannabis and cannabis related products. Cannabis products are principally sold for adult-use and medical purposes under a portfolio of distinct brands. Our core operations are in Canada, Europe and Australia and we hold a significant non-controlling, non-voting interest in an entity that participates in the sale of cannabis and hemp derived products in the United States. 
 Using a consumer-driven approach, our portfolio delivers diverse products that offer experiences for occasions our consumers seek. Our mainstream and premium branded product portfolio includes multiple cannabis formats, such as high-quality dried flower, oils, softgel capsules, infused beverages, edibles and topical formats, as well as vaporizer devices, in addition to cannabis accessories, designed to meet the needs of consumers worldwide. 
 Our cannabis cultivation operations are focused in two facilities, our greenhouse facility in Kincardine, Ontario and the DOJA facility in Kelowna, British Columbia. We believe that the cultivation capacity in the Kincardine facility and the DOJA facility, as well as externally sourced cannabis flower supply can meet the current demand for our premium dried flower. The receipt of our European Union Good Manufacturing Practices EU GMP certification at the Kincardine facility enables us to continue exporting certified medical cannabis to medical markets in Europe as well as other medical cannabis markets around the world. 
 Our licensed operational capacity in Canada includes advanced manufacturing capability for oil and softgel encapsulation, pre-rolled joints PRJ (infused and non-infused), and hash production, which is primarily completed at our Smiths Falls, Ontario facility. Through our in-house manufacturing capabilities of adult-use cannabis products, we can process and package bulk cannabis flower, PRJ and vape products, whether internally or externally sourced, into high quality cannabis products.

 Canadian Federal Budget Proposals 
 For capital gains realized on or after June 25, 2024, proposals originally released on June 10, 2024 with revised proposals released on August 12, 2024 and September 23, 2024, (collectively the Capital Gains Proposals ), would generally increase the capital gains inclusion rate from one-half to two-thirds for corporations and trusts, and from one-half to two-thirds for individuals on the portion of capital gains realized, including capital gains realized indirectly through a trust or partnership, in a taxation year (or in each case the portion of the year beginning on June 25, 2024, in the case of the 2024 taxation year) that exceed 250,000. The Capital Gains Proposals also include transitional rules that effectively adjust the capital gains inclusion rate for taxation years beginning on or before June 24, 2024 and ending on or after June 25, 2024 to generally include only one-half of net capital gains realized (or deemed to be realized) on or before June 24, 2024. The Capital Gains Proposals further propose to adjust the value of capital losses realized in previous years so that two-thirds of capital losses realized prior to June 25, 2024 will be deductible against capital gains included in income at the two-thirds inclusion rate such that a capital loss will offset an equivalent capital gain regardless of the inclusion rate (additional adjustments would be required where the capital gains have been subjected to an effective inclusion rate of one-half rather than the basic inclusion rate of two-thirds). Revised alternative minimum tax rules were enacted on June 20, 2024, which may increase a shareholder s liability for such tax.

BioSteel Canada and commenced proceedings (the "CCAA Proceedings") under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (the "CCAA") in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) (the "CCAA Court") and sought and obtained recognition of that proceeding under Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.

Net revenue was 63.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, a decrease of 6.6 million as compared to 69.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Canada cannabis 
 Net revenue from our Canada cannabis segment was 37.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 40.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Canadian adult-use cannabis net revenue was 18.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 24.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales volumes, which were partially affected by supply constraints for certain products as a result of financial difficulties with our contract manufacturers and lower sales velocity due to continued increase in price competition. 
 Canadian medical cannabis net revenue was 18.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 16.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the average size of medical orders placed by our customers due largely to an increase in the percentage of insured customers, and a larger assortment of cannabis product choices offered to our customers. 
 International markets cannabis 
 International markets cannabis revenue was 10.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 9.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to the increased shipments of flower products in Europe, driven by Poland and Germany, which was offset by a decline in our Australian medical business. 
 Storz Bickel 
 Revenue from Storz Bickel was 15.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 12.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to strong growth in Germany and the U.S., sales of our Mighty vaporizer and contribution from Venty, our new portable vaporizer that was launched in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 This Works 
 Revenue from This Works was nil in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 7.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year decrease is due to the completion of the divestiture of This Works on December 18, 2023.

Cost of goods sold was 41.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 46.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Our gross margin was 21.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, or 35 of net revenue, as compared to a gross margin of 23.4 million and gross margin percentage of 34 of net revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to improvement in our international markets cannabis segment, primarily due to an increase in sales mix to higher-margin Poland as well as a lower overall cost structure. 
 We report gross margin and gross margin percentage in four segments: (i) Canada cannabis; (ii) international markets cannabis; (iii) Storz Bickel; and (iv) This Works.

Canada cannabis 
 Gross margin for our Canada cannabis segment was 12.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, or 32 of net revenue, as compared to 14.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, or 36 of net revenue. The year-over-year decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to lower adult-use sales, partially offset by increased sales in higher-margin medical 
 43 

business, the realized benefit of our cost savings program and strategic changes to our business that were initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and a year-over-year decrease in write-downs of excess inventory. 
 International markets cannabis 
 Gross margin for our international markets cannabis segment was 4.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, or 47 of net revenue, as compared to 2.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, or 30 of net revenue. The year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to the shift in sales mix to higher-margin Poland, a shift in sales mix within individual markets to higher margin products, and a lower cost structure relating to our overall international cannabis operations. 
 Storz Bickel 
 Gross margin for our Storz Bickel segment was 5.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, or 32 of net revenue, as compared to 3.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, or 33 of net revenue. The year-over-year gross margin percentage remained consistent period over period as rebates provided to clear out remaining stock of a previously planned discontinued product were offset by strong margins realized on other product sales. 
 This Works 
 Gross margin for our This Works segment was nil in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, or 0 of net revenue, as compared to 3.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, or 48 of net revenue. The year-over-year decrease in the gross margin percentage is due to the completion of the divestiture of This Works on December 18, 2023.

Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 41.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 57.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 General and administrative expense was 16.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 20.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to: (i) the divestiture of This Works on December 18, 2023 and (ii) the impact of the restructuring actions and cost savings program initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Sales and marketing expense was 15.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 19.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to: (i) the divestiture of This Works on December 18, 2023 and (ii) the impact of the restructuring actions and cost savings program initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Acquisition, divestiture, and other costs were 3.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 10.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, costs were incurred primarily in relation to: 
 continued legal costs arising from the restatement of our consolidated financial statements in connection with the review of the financial reporting matters related to the BioSteel business unit; 

the Reorganization of Canopy USA; and 

costs relating to the modification of the Credit Agreement (as defined below) that occurred in August 2024. 

Comparatively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, costs were incurred primarily in relation to: 
 costs relating to the modification of the Credit Agreement that occurred in July 2023; 

legal and audit costs arising from the restatement of our consolidated financial statements in connection with the review of the financial reporting matters related to the BioSteel business unit; 

44 

the Reorganization of Canopy USA. 

Depreciation and amortization expense was 6.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 7.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to the previously-noted restructuring actions and cost savings programs, including the closure of certain of our Canadian facilities and other operational changes to implement cultivation-related efficiencies and improvements in the Canadian adult-use cannabis business. 
 Share-based compensation expense 
 Share-based compensation expense was 5.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 2.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to: (i) the first quarter of fiscal 2025 grant of 0.8 million options and 0.7 million restricted share units, and (ii) higher forfeitures in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 due to previously-noted restructuring actions. 
 Loss (gain) on asset impairment and restructuring 
 Loss (gain) on asset impairment and restructuring recorded in operating expenses were 20.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to (29.9) million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Loss on asset impairment and restructuring recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 related primarily to the non-cash impairment of divestiture-related assets, employee restructuring costs, and ongoing holding costs to maintain previously restructured sites. 
 Comparatively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the gain on asset impairment and restructuring was primarily related to a gain on the sale of our production facility at 1 Hershey Drive in Smiths Falls, Ontario. The gain is due to the sale proceeds exceeding the carrying value that was previously impaired at March 31, 2023. This gain was partially offset by various incremental impairment losses and other costs associated with the restructuring of our Canadian cannabis operations that were initiated in the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Other income (expense), net 
 Other income (expense), net was an expense amount of 85.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to an expense amount of 128.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year change of 43.0 million is primarily attributable to: 
 Change of 34.9 million related to non-cash fair value changes on our other financial assets, from an expense amount of 82.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to an expense amount of 47.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The expense amount recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 is primarily attributable to fair value decreases relating to our investments in: 

o the Canopy Elevate I LLC, Canopy Elevate II LLC and Canopy Elevate III LLC (collectively, Elevate loan receivable, in the amount of 41.9 million relating to fair value movements in consideration of the debtor's net assets; and 

o the Acreage Debt (as defined below) loan receivable, in the amount of 5.5 million, primarily attributable to changes in market conditions and assumptions. 

Comparatively, the expense amount in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily attributable to fair value decreases relating to our investments in: 
 o the Wana financial instrument, in the amount of 43.6 million, which was attributable primarily to changes in expectations of the future cash flows to be generated by Wana; 

o the Acreage financial instrument, in the amount of 23.4 million. On a quarterly basis, we determine the fair value of the Acreage financial instrument using a probability-weighted expected return model, incorporating several potential scenarios and outcomes associated with the Acreage Amended Arrangement. The fair value decrease in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 106 in our share price during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, relative to an increase of approximately 191 in Acreage s share price during that same period. As a result, the model at September 30, 2023 reflects both a higher estimated value of the 

45 

Canopy Growth common shares expected to be issued upon Canopy USA's acquisition of Acreage, and a higher estimated value of the Acreage shares expected to be acquired at that time. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the relative share price movements resulted in a decrease in the value of the Acreage financial instrument; 

o the Universal Hemp, LLC Acreage Hempco debenture, in the amount of 19.5 million, which was attributable primarily to changes in expected future cash flows to be received; and 

o the Jetty financial instrument, in the amount of 17.3 million, which was attributable primarily to changes in the expectations of the future cash flows to be generated by Jetty. 

These fair value decreases were partially offset by fair value increases related to our investments in: 
 o the TerrAscend Exchangeable Shares, in the amount of 13.2 million, primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 17 in TerrAscend s share price during the second quarter of fiscal 2024; and 

o the TerrAscend Warrants, in the amount of 7.2 million, primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 17 in TerrAscend s share price during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 

Increase in expense of 13.7 million related to non-cash fair value changes on our equity method investments, from nil in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to an expense amount of 13.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The year-over-year change is driven by the fair value change of our Canopy USA equity method investment in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. 

Decrease in expense of 27.1 million related to non-cash fair value changes on our debt, from 27.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to nil in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The year-over-year change is driven primarily by the fair value change of the CBI Note in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025 there are no debt balances recorded at fair value. 

Change of 10.5 million related to fair value changes on acquisition related contingent consideration and other, from an income amount of 3.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to an expense amount of 6.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The fair value change in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 relates primarily to acquisition consideration from a divestiture-related asset. Comparatively, the fair value change in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, related primarily to the estimated deferred payments associated with our investment in Wana. 

Change of 7.6 million related to charges associated with the settlement of our debt, from an expense amount of 7.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to an income amount of 0.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025 we recognized a gain of 0.3 million, primarily in connection with the partial settlement of the Supreme Debentures. Comparatively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized a charge in the amount of 7.3 million which is primarily due to principal repayments on the Credit Facility. 

Decrease in interest income of 1.0 million, from 3.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to 2.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The year-over-year decrease is attributable to lower cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances. 

Decrease in interest expense of 6.1 million, from 27.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to 21.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction of our debt balances. 

Income tax expense 
 Income tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 0.3 million, compared to income tax expense of 12.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, income tax expense consisted of deferred income tax expense of 0.2 million (compared to an expense of 12.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024) and current income tax expense of 0.1 million (compared to an expense of 0.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024). 
 The decrease of 12.3 million in the deferred income tax expense is primarily a result of the settlements of the Canopy Notes (as defined below) in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and utilization of losses for tax purposes, where the accounting criteria for recognition of an asset has been met. 
 The decrease of 0.2 million in current income tax expense arose primarily as a result of the utilization of group s tax attributes to shelter tax on income for tax purposes. 
 Net Loss from Continuing Operations 
 The net loss from continuing operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 131.6 million, as compared to a net loss of 148.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year decrease in the net loss is primarily attributable to: (i) the year-over-year change in other income (expense), net, of 43.0 million; and (ii) offset by the change from gain to loss on asset impairment and restructuring costs. These variances are described above. 
 46 

Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Measure) 
 Our Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by management that is not defined by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Management calculates Adjusted EBITDA as the reported net income (loss), adjusted to exclude income tax recovery (expense); other income (expense), net; loss on equity method investments; share-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization expense; asset impairment and restructuring costs; restructuring costs recorded in cost of goods sold; and charges related to the flow-through of inventory step-up on business combinations, and further adjusted to remove acquisition, divestiture, and other costs. Asset impairments related to periodic changes to our supply chain processes are not excluded from Adjusted EBITDA given their occurrence through the normal course of core operational activities. Accordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful and useful financial information, as this measure demonstrates the operating performance of businesses. 
 The following table presents Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Net revenue was 129.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 16.7 million as compared to 145.9 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Canada cannabis 
 Net revenue from our Canada cannabis segment was 74.8 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 80.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Canadian adult-use cannabis net revenue was 37.3 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 48.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales volumes, which were partially affected by supply constraints for certain products as a result of financial difficulties with our contract manufacturers and lower sales velocity due to continued increase in price competition. 
 Canadian medical cannabis net revenue was 37.5 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 31.8 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the average size of medical orders placed by our customers due largely to an increase in the percentage of insured customers, and a larger assortment of cannabis product choices offered to our customers. 
 International markets cannabis 
 International markets cannabis revenue was 20.1 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 19.1 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to the increased shipments of flower products in Europe, driven by Poland and Germany, which was offset by a decline in our Australian medical business. 
 Storz Bickel 
 Revenue from Storz Bickel was 34.3 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 30.1 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to strong growth in Germany and the U.S., sales of our Mighty vaporizer and contribution from Venty, our new portable vaporizer that was launched in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 This Works 
 Revenue from This Works was nil in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 13.1 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease is due to the completion of the divestiture of This Works on December 18, 2023.

Cost of goods sold was 84.3 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 108.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross margin was 44.9 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, or 35 of net revenue, as compared to a gross margin of 37.2 million and gross margin percentage of 25 of net revenue in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to: 
 Improvement in our Canada cannabis segment, primarily attributable to: (i) the realized benefit of our cost savings program and strategic changes to our business that were initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023; (ii) a year-over-year decrease in write-downs of excess inventory; and (iii) a shift in channel mix to higher margin medical sales; and 

Improvement in our international markets cannabis segment, primarily due to an increase in sales mix to higher-margin Poland as well as a lower overall cost structure. 

We report gross margin and gross margin percentage in four segments: (i) Canada cannabis; (ii) international markets cannabis; (iii) Storz Bickel; and (iv) This Works.

Canada cannabis 
 Gross margin for our Canada cannabis segment was 24.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, or 32 of net revenue, as compared to 14.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023, or 18 of net revenue. The year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to: (i) the realized benefit of our cost savings program and strategic changes to our business that were initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023; (ii) a year-over-year decrease in write-downs of excess inventory; and (iii) strong Canadian medical cannabis sales. 
 International markets cannabis 
 Gross margin for our international markets cannabis segment was 8.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, or 42 of net revenue, as compared to 6.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023, or 32 of net revenue. The year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to the shift in sales mix to higher-margin Poland as well as a lower cost structure relating to our overall international cannabis operations. 
 Storz Bickel 
 Gross margin for our Storz Bickel segment was 12.5 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, or 36 of net revenue, as compared to 11.6 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023, or 39 of net revenue. The year-over-year decrease in the gross margin percentage is driven primarily by a shift in product mix as additional rebates were provided to clear out remaining stock of a previously planned discontinued product. 
 This Works 
 Gross margin for our This Works segment was nil in the six months ended September 30, 2024, or 0 of net revenue, as compared to 6.3 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023, or 48 of net revenue. The year-over-year decrease in the gross margin percentage is due to the completion of the divestiture of This Works on December 18, 2023.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 89.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 120.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and administrative expense was 35.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 45.6 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to: (i) the divestiture of This Works on December 18, 2023 and (ii) the impact of the restructuring actions and cost savings program initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Sales and marketing expense was 30.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 40.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to: (i) the divestiture of This Works on December 18, 2023 and (ii) the impact of the restructuring actions and cost savings program initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Acquisition, divestiture, and other costs were 11.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 19.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. In the six months ended September 30, 2024, costs were incurred primarily in relation to: 
 the Reorganization of Canopy USA; 

50 

costs associated with the Debt Acquisition of Acreage; 

continued legal costs arising from the restatement of our consolidated financial statements in connection with the review of the financial reporting matters related to the BioSteel business unit; and 

costs relating to the modification of the Credit Agreement that occurred in August 2024. 

Comparatively, in the six months ended September 30, 2023, costs were incurred primarily in relation to: 
 costs relating to the modification of the Credit Agreement that occurred in July 2023; 

legal and audit costs arising from the restatement of our consolidated financial statements in connection with the review of the financial reporting matters related to the BioSteel business unit; 

the Reorganization of Canopy USA. 

Depreciation and amortization expense was 12.1 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 15.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to the previously-noted restructuring actions and cost savings programs, including the closure of certain of our Canadian facilities and other operational changes to implement cultivation-related efficiencies and improvements in the Canadian adult-use cannabis business. 
 Share-based compensation expense 
 Share-based compensation expense was 9.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to: (i) the first quarter of fiscal 2025 grant of 0.8 million options and 0.7 million restricted share units, and (ii) higher forfeitures in the first half of fiscal 2024 due to previously-noted restructuring actions. 
 Loss (gain) on asset impairment and restructuring 
 Loss (gain) on asset impairment and restructuring recorded in operating expenses were 20.9 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to (28.0) million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loss on asset impairment and restructuring recorded in the six months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to the non-cash impairment of divestiture-related assets, employee restructuring costs, and ongoing holding costs to maintain previously restructured sites. These amounts were offset by a gain related to remeasurement of a lease liability upon execution of the surrender agreement. 
 Comparatively, in the six months ended September 30, 2023, the gain on asset impairment and restructuring was primarily related to a gain on the sale of our production facility at 1 Hershey Drive in Smiths Falls, Ontario. The gain is due to the sale proceeds exceeding the carrying value that was previously impaired at March 31, 2023. This gain was partially offset by various incremental impairment losses and other costs associated with the restructuring of our Canadian cannabis operations that were initiated in the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Other income (expense), net 
 Other income (expense), net was an expense amount of 179.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an expense amount of 82.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year change of 97.0 million is primarily attributable to: 
 Change of 29.4 million related to non-cash fair value changes on our other financial assets, from an expense amount of 17.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 to an expense amount of 46.6 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024. The expense amount recognized in the six months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to fair value decreases relating to our investments in: 

o the Elevate loan receivable, in the amount of 34.6 million relating to fair value movements in consideration of the debtor's net assets; and 

o the Acreage Debt loan receivable, in the amount of 6.0 million, primarily attributable to changes in market conditions and assumptions. 

o the Acreage financial instrument, in the amount of 31.8 million. On a quarterly basis, we determine the fair value of the Acreage financial instrument using a probability-weighted expected return model, incorporating several 

51 

potential scenarios and outcomes associated with the Acreage Amended Arrangement. The fair value decrease in the six months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 75 in our share price up to the Deconsolidation Date (as defined below), relative to an increase of approximately 46 in Acreage s share price during that same period. As a result, the model at the Deconsolidation Date reflects both a higher estimated value of the Canopy Growth common shares expected to be issued upon Canopy USA s acquisition of Acreage, and a higher estimated value of the Acreage shares expected to be acquired at that time. In the period up to the Deconsolidation Date, the relative share price movements resulted in a decrease in the value of the Acreage financial instrument; and 

o Indiva Limited Indiva shares, in the amount of 2.8 million due a decrease in their share price as a result of their CCAA proceedings. 

These fair value decreases were partially offset by a fair value increases related to our investments in: 
 o the TerrAscend Exchangeable Shares, in the amount of 17.3 million, which was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 16 in TerrAscend s share price up to April 30, 2024, being the date that Canopy Growth deconsolidated the financial results of Canopy USA (the Deconsolidation Date 

o the TerrAscend Warrants, in the amount of 7.9 million, which was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 16 in TerrAscend s share price up to the Deconsolidation Date; 

o the Elevate loan receivable, in the amount of 7.3 million relating to fair value movements in consideration of the debtor's net assets; and 

o the Acreage debt Option Premium, in the amount of 3.1 million related to closing of the Acreage Debt Acquisition and release of the amount that was previously held in escrow pursuant to the Option Agreement. 

Comparatively, the expense amount in the six months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to fair value decreases relating to our investments in: (i) the Wana financial instrument 49.1 million); (ii) the Jetty financial instrument 17.3 million); and the Acreage Hempco debenture 17.9 million). The fair value decreases were partially offset by fair value increases associated with our investments in: (i) the Acreage financial instrument 21.3 million); (ii) the TerrAscend Exchangeable Shares 33.1 million); and the TerrAscend Warrants 13.2 million). 
 Increase in expense of 89.6 million related to non-cash fair value changes on our equity method investments, from nil in the six months ended September 30, 2023 to an expense amount of 89.6 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024. The year-over-year change is driven by the fair value change of our Canopy USA equity method investment in the six months ended September 30, 2024. 

Decrease in expense of 25.2 million related to non-cash fair value changes on our debt, from 25.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 to nil in the six months ended September 30, 2024. The year-over-year change is driven primarily by the fair value change of the CBI Note in the six months ended September 30, 2023. In the six months ended September 30, 2024 there are no debt balances recorded at fair value. 

Change of 44.0 million related to fair value changes on acquisition related contingent consideration and other, from an income amount of 10.5 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 to an expense amount of 33.5 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024. The fair value change in the six months ended September 30, 2024 relates primarily to various acquisition related contingent consideration. Comparatively, the fair value change in the six months ended September 30, 2023, related primarily to the estimated deferred payments associated with our investment in Wana. 

Change of 35.0 million related to charges associated with the settlement of our debt, from an expense amount of 12.6 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 to an income amount of 22.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024. In the six months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized a gain of 22.4 million, primarily in connection with the exchange of the CBI Note. Comparatively, in the six months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a charge in the amount of 12.6 million which is primarily due to the settlement of our unsecured senior notes and principal repayments on the Credit Facility. 

Decrease in interest income of 6.8 million, from 11.3 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.5 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024. The year-over-year decrease is attributable to lower cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances. 

Decrease in interest expense of 17.2 million, from 59.6 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 to 42.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction of our debt balances. 

Income tax expense 
 Income tax expense in the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.5 million, compared to income tax expense of 14.8 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. In the six months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense consisted of 
 52 

deferred income tax expense of 6.2 million (compared to an expense of 14.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023) and current income tax expense of 0.3 million (compared to an expense of 0.8 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023). 
 The decrease of 7.8 million in the deferred income tax expense is primarily a result of: (i) a decrease due to the settlements of the Canopy Notes in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 relative to the settlements of the CBI Note in fiscal 2025; and (ii) an increase due to the realization of deferred taxes for entities that historically did not meet the deferred tax asset recognition criteria. 
 The decrease of 0.5 million in current income tax expense arose primarily in connection with previously cash taxable legal entities that are no longer taxable and as a result of the utilization of group s tax attributes to shelter tax on income for tax purposes. 
 Net Loss from Continuing Operations 
 The net loss from continuing operations in the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 260.7 million, as compared to a net loss of 158.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase in the net loss is primarily attributable to: (i) the year-over-year change in other income (expense), net, of 97.0 million; (ii) the change from gain to loss on asset impairment and restructuring costs; and (iii) offset by the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and improvement in gross margins. These variances are described above. 
 Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Measure) 
 Our Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by management that is not defined by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Management calculates Adjusted EBITDA as the reported net income (loss), adjusted to exclude income tax recovery (expense); other income (expense), net; loss on equity method investments; share-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization expense; asset impairment and restructuring costs; restructuring costs recorded in cost of goods sold; and charges related to the flow-through of inventory step-up on business combinations, and further adjusted to remove acquisition, divestiture, and other costs. Asset impairments related to periodic changes to our supply chain processes are not excluded from Adjusted EBITDA given their occurrence through the normal course of core operational activities. Accordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful and useful financial information, as this measure demonstrates the operating performance of businesses. 
 The following table presents Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

The Adjusted EBITDA loss in the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.8 million, as compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of 34.8 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease in Adjusted EBITDA loss is primarily attributable to the year-over-year increase in our gross margin and the year-over-year decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 Part 3 Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 In our condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2023, we raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the issuance of those condensed interim consolidated financial statements, due to certain material debt obligations coming due in the short-term, recurring losses from operations and additional required financing to fund our business and operations. 
 As of the filing of the Annual Report, we were able to successfully mitigate the substantial doubt by completing several balance sheet actions as further described in the Annual Report. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we completed additional actions and established our at-the-market equity program (the ATM Program ), issued and sold an aggregate of 16,805,852 common shares for gross proceeds of 138.5 million under the ATM Program, received additional proceeds from the BioSteel Canada asset sale, amended the terms of the Credit Facility thereby extending the maturity date of the Credit Facility, and paid down certain debt balances. We continue to evaluate different strategies and may pursue additional actions that are expected to further increase our 
 53 

liquidity position, including, but not limited to, pursuing additional actions under our cost-savings plan and seeking additional financing from both the public and private markets through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities. 
 We have access to further liquidity through public offerings of equity and debt securities. To facilitate such offerings, in June 2024, we filed (a) a shelf registration statement with the SEC that is effective for a term of three years and expires in June 2027 (the Shelf Registration Statement and (b) a short form base shelf prospectus dated June 5, 2024 that is effective for a 25 month period (the Canadian Shelf Prospectus ). The amount of securities to be issued pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit on the amount of securities we may issue. Pursuant to the Canadian Shelf Prospectus we may sell securities up to an aggregate total offering price of US 500 million (or the equivalent thereof in other currencies). The securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement and the Canadian Shelf Prospectus include: (i) common shares; (ii) exchangeable shares; (iii) debt securities; (iv) subscription receipts; (v) warrants; and (viii) units consisting of one or more of such securities or any combination of these securities. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering. 
 We may also access liquidity through the ATM Program, pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to US 101.1 million of additional common shares as of the date hereof. Refer to Notes 19 and 30 to the Interim Financial Statements. 
 As a result of our plans above and the financial results at September 30, 2024, we conclude that the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern continues to be alleviated. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 228.4 million and short-term investments of 2.8 million. 
 We have recently completed the following debt and equity financings and repayments: 
 On April 18, 2024, we entered into the April 2024 Exchange Agreement with Greenstar, pursuant to which Greenstar completed the Note Exchange, calculated based on a price per Exchangeable Share equal to 8.91. Pursuant to the terms of the April 2024 Exchange Agreement, all accrued but unpaid interest on the CBI Note together with the remaining principal amount of the CBI Note was cancelled and forgiven for no additional consideration by Greenstar. Following the closing of the Note Exchange, there is no outstanding balance owing under the CBI Note and the CBI Note has been cancelled. 

On May 2, 2024, we entered into the Exchange and Subscription Agreement with the May 2024 Investor pursuant to which, among other things, the May 2024 Investor delivered to us approximately 27.5 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Supreme Debentures and Accretion Debentures held by the May 2024 Investor and paid us approximately 68.3 million (US 50.0 million) in exchange for us issuing to the May 2024 Investor (i) the May 2024 Convertible Debenture with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 96.4 million maturing five years from the Closing Date and (ii) 3,350,430 May 2024 Investor Warrants. Each May 2024 Investor Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one Canopy Share at an exercise price equal to 16.18 per Canopy Share for a period of five years from the Closing Date. The May 2024 Convertible Debenture bears interest at a rate of 7.50 per annum, payable in semi-annual payments in cash or, at our option, in Canopy Shares for the first four semi-annual interest payments after the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including the prior approval of the TSX. 

The Exchange and Subscription Agreement granted the May 2024 Investor, during the Agreement ROFR Term, a right of first refusal to subscribe for, and to be issued, as the sole investor in a Proposed Private Placement; provided, however, that the May 2024 Investor shall subscribe for 100 of the Proposed Private Placement on the same terms and conditions contemplated in the Proposed Private Placement. 
 The May 2024 Convertible Debenture is convertible into Canopy Shares at the option of the May 2024 Investor at a conversion price equal to 14.38 per share. The May 2024 Convertible Debenture is subject to a forced conversion feature upon notice from us in the event that the average closing trading price of the Canopy Shares on the TSX exceeds 21.57 for a period of 10 consecutive trading days. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the May 2024 Convertible Debenture, during Debenture ROFR Term, we granted the May 2024 Investor a right of first refusal to subscribe for, and to be issued, as an investor in a Proposed Financing; provided, however, that the May 2024 Investor shall subscribe for 25 of the Proposed Financing on the same terms and conditions contemplated in the Proposed Financing. 
 On June 6, 2024, we established the ATM Program that allows us to sell up to US 250 million of common shares of the Company from treasury to the public from time to time at the Company s discretion. As part of the ATM Program, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 we sold an aggregate of 12,057,788 common shares at an average price of 7.64 per common share, for gross proceeds of 92.2 million and net proceeds, inclusive of commissions and fees, of 90.8 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we paid an aggregate amount of 1.4 million as compensation to the agents involved in the sale of our common shares under the ATM Program. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2024 we sold an aggregate of 16,805,852 common shares at an average price of 8.24 per common share, for gross proceeds of 138.5 million and net proceeds, inclusive of commissions and fees, of 136.4 million. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we paid an aggregate amount of 2.1 million as compensation to the agents involved in the sale of our common shares under the ATM Program. 
 54 

On August 20, 2024, we entered into the August 2024 Supreme Convertible Debt Exchange with the August 2024 Investor pursuant to which, among other things, the August 2024 Investor delivered to the Company approximately 2.7 million of aggregate principal amount of outstanding Supreme Debentures held by the August 2024 Investor in exchange for 291,351 common shares of the Company and 0.03 million in cash for accrued interest. 

In addition to the above, we continue to review and pursue selected external financing sources to ensure adequate financial resources. These potential sources include, but are not limited to: (i) obtaining financing from traditional or non-traditional investment capital organizations; (ii) obtaining funding from the sale of our common shares or other equity or debt instruments; and (iii) obtaining debt financing with lending terms that more closely match our business model and capital needs. We may from time to time seek to retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, and open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

1 Includes net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations of nil and (54,709) for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

2 Includes net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of 13,414 and (17,122) for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

3 Includes cash of our discontinued operations of nil and 9,314 for March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

4 Includes cash of our discontinued operations of nil and 2,599 for September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Operating activities 
 Cash used in operating activities totaled 105.6 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash used of 227.3 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the cash used in operating activities is primarily due to: (i) the year-over-year decrease in our working capital spending, resulting from our previously-noted restructuring actions and cost savings programs, including the closure of certain of our Canadian facilities and other operational changes to implement cultivation-related efficiencies and improvements in the Canadian adult-use cannabis business; and (ii) a reduction in the cash interest paid resulting from a reduction in our debt balances. 
 Investing activities 
 The cash used in investing activities totaled 32.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash provided of 202.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 In the six months ended September 30, 2024, purchases of property, plant and equipment were 6.5 million, primarily related to building improvements and production equipment enhancements made at certain of our Canadian cultivation and production facilities. Comparatively, in the six months ended September 30, 2023, we invested 2.6 million in production equipment enhancements made at certain of our Canadian cultivation and production facilities, and at our Storz Bickel facilities. 
 In the six months ended September 30, 2024, our strategic investments in other financial assets were 95.3 million and related primarily to the cash payment to acquire the outstanding principal, including all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, of Acreage s debt, being an amount up to US 150.0 million (the Acreage Debt ). Comparatively, in the six months ended September 30, 2023, our strategic investments in other financial assets were 0.5 million and related primarily to our investment in Indiva. 
 Net redemptions of short-term investments in the six months ended September 30, 2024 were 30.2 million, as compared to net redemptions of 81.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease in the net redemptions reflects the continued redemption of our short-term investments, largely to fund operations and investing activities as described above. As at September 30, 2024, we had short-term investments remaining of 2.8 million. 
 Net cash flow on sale or deconsolidation of subsidiaries in the six months ended September 30, 2024 was an outflow of 7.0 million and related to the deconsolidation of Canopy USA, refer to Note 3 in the Company s accompanying financial statements for details. Comparatively, there were no sale or deconsolidation of subsidiaries in the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 55 

Additional cash inflows during the six months ended September 30, 2024 include proceeds of 4.9 million from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily in relation to previous restructuring actions. Comparatively, additional cash inflows during the six months ended September 30, 2023 include proceeds of 152.4 million from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily relating to facilities sold in connection with the restructuring actions associated with our Canadian cannabis operations and transition to an asset-light model. 
 Finally, other investing activities resulted in a cash inflow of 28.3 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to cash receipts from various loan repayments. Comparatively, other investing activities in the six months ended September 30, 2023 of 9.7 million primarily related to completing the purchase of the remaining 45 of the common shares of Les Serres Vert Cannabis Inc., in connection with the restructuring actions related to our Canadian cannabis operations initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Financing activities 
 The cash provided by financing activities in the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 194.7 million, as compared to cash used of 407.3 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. In the six months ended September 30, 2024, 138.5 million in gross proceeds were received from the sale of common shares as part of the ATM Program and 8.5 million in gross proceeds were received from the exercise of warrants, these amounts were offset by share issuance costs of 4.7 million. 
 In addition, 68.3 million was received relating to the Exchange and Subscription Agreement, offset by long-term debt repayments of 13.5 million which related primarily to the First Quarter 2025 Paydowns and Second Quarter 2025 Paydowns. 
 Other financing activities resulted in a cash outflow of 7.1 million, which related primarily to: (i) share issuance costs, as noted above and (ii) finance lease payments. 
 Comparatively, in the six months ended September 30, 2023, we made repayments of long-term debt in the amount of 415.2 million, which related to the various paydowns of our Credit Facility and settlement of the 4.25 unsecured senior notes due in 2023 (the Canopy Notes ). Other financing activity cash outflow of 25.9 million related primarily to payments made in connection with terminating the finance lease for the cultivation facility in Mirabel, Quebec. In addition, debt extinguishment and issuance costs, and share issue costs contributed to the cash outflow. The cash outflows were offset by proceeds from the issuance of common shares. 
 Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Measure) 
 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure used by management that is not defined by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Management believes that free cash flow presents meaningful information regarding the amount of cash flow required to maintain and organically expand our business, and that the free cash flow measure provides meaningful information regarding our liquidity requirements.

Free cash flow in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was an outflow of 56.4 million, as compared to an outflow of 67.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease in the free cash outflow primarily reflects the decrease in cash used in operating activities, as described above. 
 Free cash flow in the six months ended September 30, 2024 was an outflow of 112.1 million, as compared to an outflow of 175.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease in the free cash outflow primarily reflects the decrease in cash used in operating activities, as described above. 
 Debt 
 Since our formation, we have financed our cash requirements primarily through the issuance of common shares of Canopy Growth, including the 5.1 billion investment by CBI in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and debt. Total debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was 553.9 million, a decrease from 597.2 million as of March 31, 2024. The total principal amount owing was 574.1 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease from 622.0 million at March 31, 2024. The decreases were primarily due to: (i) the April 2024 Exchange Agreement, which resulted in the settlement of all amounts owing under the CBI Note; (ii) the First Quarter 
 56 

2025 Paydowns resulting in an aggregate principal reduction of 11.2 million; (iii) the Second Quarter 2025 Paydown resulting in an aggregate principal reduction of 1.1 million; and (iv) the August 2024 Supreme Convertible Debt Exchange (as defined below) and offset by the Exchange and Subscription Agreement where a cash payment of approximately US 50 million was received and approximately 27.5 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding Supreme Debentures and Accretion Debentures were settled in exchange for a new senior unsecured convertible debenture with an aggregate principal amount of 96.4 million. 
 Credit Facility 
 On March 18, 2021, the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") providing for a five-year, first lien senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of US 750.0 million (the Credit Facility ). 
 The Company had the ability to obtain up to an additional US 500.0 million of incremental senior secured debt pursuant to the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the balance sheet actions completed in connection with the Reorganization, on October 24, 2022, we entered into agreements with certain of our lenders under the Credit Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase in the aggregate US 187.5 million of the principal amount outstanding under the Credit Facility at a discounted price of US 930 per US 1,000 or US 174.4 million in the aggregate. The first payment, which was oversubscribed, in the amount of approximately 117.5 million (US 87.9 million) was made on November 10, 2022 to reduce the principal indebtedness under the Credit Facility by approximately 126.3 million (US 94.4 million). The second payment of approximately 116.8 million (US 87.2 million) was made on April 17, 2023 to reduce principal indebtedness under the Credit Facility by approximately 125.6 million (US 93.8 million). Additionally, on October 24, 2022, we and certain of our lenders agreed to make certain amendments to the Credit Agreement which, among other things, resulted in: (i) a reduction to the minimum liquidity covenant to no less than US 100.0 million following completion of the second principal repurchase on April 17, 2023; (ii) certain changes to the application of net proceeds from asset sales; (iii) the establishment of a new committed delayed draw term credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of US 100.0 million; and (iv) the elimination of the additional US 500.0 million incremental term loan facility. 
 On July 13, 2023, we entered into an amended Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement ). The Amended Credit Agreement required the Company to prepay or repurchase principal indebtedness under the Credit Facility in an amount equal to the U.S. dollar equivalent of 93,000 at a discounted price of US 930 per US 1,000 (the "July 2023 Paydown"). In addition, pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement we agreed to apply certain net proceeds from asset sales to prepay or repurchase principal indebtedness under the Credit Facility and receive principal reductions at, in certain circumstances, a discounted price of US 950 per US 1,000. The Amended Credit Agreement also includes, among other things, amendments to the minimum liquidity covenant such that the US 100.0 million minimum ceased to apply concurrently with the July 2023 Paydown. The July 2023 Paydown was made on July 21, 2023. 
 On each of August 11, 2023 and September 14, 2023, pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, we repurchased additional outstanding principal amounts under the Credit Facility using certain net proceeds from completed asset sales (the Second Quarter 2024 Paydowns ).

 On August 8, 2024, we entered into an amendment (the Amending Agreement with all of the lenders to the Credit Facility under the Amended Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Amending Agreement, the maturity date of the Credit Facility was extended to December 18, 2026 and a mandatory US 97.5 million prepayment of the Credit Facility at 97.5 of par thereby reducing the outstanding amount of the Credit Facility by US 100 million was required to be made by December 31, 2024. We made the mandatory prepayment on October 16, 2024. In addition, the maturity date of the Credit Facility will be further extended to September 18, 2027 if an optional prepayment on the same terms is made on or before March 31, 2025.

Our obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by our material wholly-owned Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and our material wholly-owned Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries, including material real property. The Amended Credit Agreement, as amended by the Amending Agreement contains representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants. 
 57 

On September 27, 2024, we made the Second Quarter 2025 Paydown. The Second Quarter 2025 Paydown resulted in an aggregate principal reduction of 1.1 million (US 0.9 million) for a cash payment of 1.1 million (US 0.9 million).

 Supreme Cannabis Convertible Debentures and Accretion Debentures 
 On October 19, 2018, Supreme Cannabis Company, Inc. Supreme Cannabis issued 6.0 senior unsecured convertible debentures (the Supreme Debentures for gross proceeds of 100.0 million.

 In addition, on September 9, 2020, Supreme Cannabis issued new senior unsecured non-convertible debentures (the Accretion Debentures ). The principal amount began at nil and accretes at a rate of 11.06 per annum based on the remaining principal amount of the Supreme Debentures of 36.5 million to a maximum of 13.5 million, compounding on a semi-annual basis commencing on September 9, 2020, and ending on September 9, 2023. As of September 9, 2023, the principal amount of the Accretion Debentures was finalized as 10.4 million. The Accretion Debentures are payable in cash, but do not bear cash interest and are not convertible into Supreme Shares (as defined below). The principal amount of the Accretion Debentures will amortize, or be paid, at 1.0 per month over the 24 months prior to maturity. 
 As a result of the arrangement (the Supreme Arrangement we completed with Supreme Cannabis on June 22, 2021 pursuant to which we acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding common shares of Supreme Cannabis (the Supreme Shares ), the Supreme Debentures remain outstanding as securities of Supreme Cannabis, which, upon conversion will entitle the holder thereof to receive, in lieu of the number of Supreme Shares to which such holder was theretofore entitled, the consideration payable under the Supreme Arrangement that such holder would have been entitled to be issued and receive if, immediately prior to the effective time of the Supreme Arrangement, such holder had been the registered holder of the number of Supreme Shares to which such holder was theretofore entitled. 
 In connection with the Supreme Arrangement, we, Supreme Cannabis and Computershare Trust Company of Canada (the Trustee entered into a supplemental indenture whereby we agreed to issue common shares upon conversion of any Supreme Debenture. In addition, we may force conversion of the Supreme Debentures outstanding with 30 days notice if the daily volume weighted average trading price of our common shares is greater than 385.90 for any 10 consecutive trading days. We, Supreme Cannabis and the Trustee entered into a further supplemental indenture whereby we agreed to guarantee the obligations of Supreme Cannabis pursuant to the Supreme Debentures and the Accretion Debentures. 
 Prior to September 9, 2023, the Supreme Debentures were not redeemable. Beginning on and after September 9, 2023, Supreme Cannabis may from time to time, upon providing 60 days prior written notice to the Trustee, redeem the Supreme Debentures outstanding, provided that the Accretion Debentures have already been redeemed in full. 
 Refer to the May 2024 Convertible Debenture details below for details on partial settlement of the Supreme Debentures and Accretion Debentures. 
 On August 20, 2024, we entered into the August 2024 Supreme Convertible Debt Exchange with the August 2024 Investor pursuant to which, among other things, the August 2024 Investor delivered to the Company approximately 2.7 million of aggregate principal amount of outstanding Supreme Debentures held by the August 2024 Investor in exchange for 291,351 common shares of the Company and 0.03 million in cash for accrued interest. 
 May 2024 Convertible Debenture 
 On May 2, 2024, we entered into the Exchange and Subscription Agreement with the May 2024 Investor pursuant to which, among other things, the May 2024 Investor delivered to us approximately 27.5 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Supreme Debentures and Accretion Debentures held by the May 2024 Investor and paid us approximately US 50 million in exchange for us issuing to the May 2024 Investor (i) the May 2024 Convertible Debenture with an aggregate principal amount of 96.4 million maturing five years from the Closing Date of the Transaction and (ii) 3,350,430 May 2024 Investor Warrants of Canopy Growth.

 Other than changes to our Supreme Cannabis Convertible Debentures and Accretion Debentures, the May 2024 Convertible Debenture, the CBI Note, the First Quarter 2025 Paydowns, the Second Quarter 2025 Paydown and certain agreements entered into in connection with the Reorganization, the Reorganization Amendments and the Additional Reorganization Amendments, as described above under Recent Developments , there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments from the information provided in the MD A section in the Annual Report. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in the MD A section in the Annual Report. 
 Impairment of goodwill 
 We do not believe that an event occurred or circumstances changed during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the Storz Bickel reporting unit below its carrying value. Therefore, we concluded that the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment was not required for the Storz Bickel reporting unit at September 30, 2024. The carrying value of goodwill associated with the Storz Bickel reporting unit was 44,531 at September 30, 2024. 
 We are required to perform our next annual goodwill impairment analysis on March 31, 2025, or earlier should there be an event that occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitativ e Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. As a result of our global operating, acquisition and financing activities, we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. To manage the volatility relating to these risks, we may periodically purchase derivative instruments including foreign currency forwards. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Foreign currency risk 
 Our Interim Financial Statements are presented in Canadian dollars. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries, including those in the United States and Europe, are not in Canadian dollars. The translation of foreign currencies to Canadian dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and for revenues and expense using an average exchange rate for the period. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. The resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 A hypothetical 10 change in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2024, would affect the carrying value of net assets by approximately 83.2 million, with a corresponding impact to the foreign currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). A hypothetical 10 change in the euro against the Canadian dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2024, would affect the carrying value of net assets by approximately 19.8 million, with a corresponding impact to the foreign currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 We also have exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. 
 59 

Foreign currency derivative instruments may be used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, forecasted foreign currency denominated sales/purchases to/from third parties as well as intercompany sales/purchases, intercompany principal and interest payments, and in connection with acquisitions, divestitures or investments outside of Canada. Historically, while we have purchased derivative instruments to mitigate the foreign exchange risks associated with certain transactions, the impact of these hedging transactions on our financial statements has been immaterial. 
 Interest rate risk 
 Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. As at September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments consisted of 91.7 million in interest rate sensitive instruments (March 31, 2024 88.0 million). 
 Our financial liabilities consist of long-term fixed rate debt and floating-rate debt. Fluctuations in interest rates could impact our cash flows, primarily with respect to the interest payable on floating-rate debt.

Equity price risk 
 We hold other financial assets and liabilities in the form of investments in shares, warrants, options, put liabilities, and convertible debentures that are measured at fair value and recorded through either net income (loss) or other comprehensive income (loss). We are exposed to price risk on these financial assets, which is the risk of variability in fair value due to movements in equity or market prices. 
 Information regarding the fair value of financial instrument assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and the relationship between the unobservable inputs used in the valuation of these financial assets and their fair value is presented in Note 23 of the Interim Financial Statements.

Item 4. Control s and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, and summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
 Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported and (b) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER I NFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Other than as disclosed below, we are not aware of: (a) any legal proceedings to which we are a party, or to which any of our properties is subject, which would be material to us or of any such proceedings being contemplated, (b) any penalties or sanctions imposed by a court relating to securities legislation, or other penalties or sanctions imposed by a court or regulatory body against us that would likely be considered important to a reasonable investor making an investment decision, and (c) any settlement agreements that we have entered into before a court relating to securities legislation or with a securities regulatory authority. 
 On May 23, 2023, an ostensible shareholder commenced a putative class action (Turpel v. Canopy Growth Corporation, et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-043022-PAE) against the Company and two of its officers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired the Company s securities between May 31, 2022 and May 10, 2023, alleging violations of U.S. federal securities laws. Two similar cases were subsequently filed, captioned as Kantner v. Canopy Growth Corporation, et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-06266-PAE and Allen v. Canopy Growth Corporation, et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-05891-PAE. 
 On November 30, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York consolidated the Turpel, Kantner and Allen actions (captioned as In re Canopy Growth Securities Litigation, No. 23-cv-04302 and appointed Chen Li as lead plaintiff. On January 22, 2024, the lead plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against the Company and certain of its current and former officers, alleging claims on behalf of persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired the Company s securities between November 5, 2021 and June 22, 2023. The first amended complaint alleges that the Company made false or misleading statements and omissions regarding BioSteel s revenue, performance and operations, and the Company s internal controls over accounting and financial reporting in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The lead plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of damages, attorneys fees and costs, and other relief. On March 7, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the first amended complaint and briefing on that motion was completed on April 11, 2024. On July 17, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the first amended complaint against the Company and all individual defendants with prejudice. On July 18, 2024, the district court issued a judgment closing the case. On August 9, 2024, lead plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On October 8, 2024, the parties filed a stipulation of voluntary dismissal of the appeal with prejudice. On October 9, 2024, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit entered an order dismissing the appeal. 
 On January 18, 2024, a follow-on derivative shareholder lawsuit, captioned Press v. Schmeling et al., was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by ostensible shareholder Denise Press on behalf of Canopy Growth against the Company s directors and certain of its officers alleging misstatements and omissions regarding revenue attributed to BioSteel Canada and the Company s internal controls over accounting and financial reporting. The complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duties, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and insider trading, and seeks damages, attorneys fees and costs, and equitable relief. All proceedings in this derivative shareholder lawsuit are currently stayed. 
 On June 27, 2023, an ostensible shareholder commenced a putative class action (Dziedziejko v. Canopy Growth Corporation et al., Court File No. CV-23-00701769-00CP) in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against the Company, two of its officers, and the Company s auditor on behalf of a putative class of all persons or entities who acquired Canopy Growth s securities in the secondary market between June 1, 2021 to June 22, 2023 and held some or all of those securities until the close of trading on May 10, 2023 or June 22, 2023. 
 The plaintiff alleges that the Company s disclosures contained misrepresentations within the meaning of the Securities Act (Ontario), that certain officers authorized, permitted, or acquiesced in the release of the impugned disclosures, that the Company and one of its officers acted in a manner that was oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to the proposed class members by failing to remedy alleged deficiencies in the Company s internal controls, and that all of the defendants are liable for damages to the putative class. The action seeks an unspecified amount of damages, interest, legal fees, and the costs of administering a plan of distribution of the recovery. The Company was also named in two other putative class proceedings that were commenced between May 2023 and July 2023 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice alleging that the Company s disclosures contained misrepresentations. However, on November 10, 2023, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice decided a carriage motion staying those actions (Leonard v. Canopy Growth Corporation et al., Court File No. CV-23-00702281-00CP and Twidale v. Canopy Growth Corporation et al., Court File No. CV-23-00700135-00CP), and allowing Dziedziejko v. Canopy Growth Corporation et al., Court File No. CV-23-00701769-00CP to proceed to a class certification hearing. 
 On June 15, 2023, an ostensible shareholder commenced a putative class action (Asmaro v. Canopy Growth Corporation et al., Court File No. VLC-S-S-234351) against the Company and two of its officers in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on behalf of a putative class of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of the Company between August 6, 2021 and May 10, 2023. The lawsuit alleges that the Company s disclosures contained misrepresentations within the meaning of the Securities Act (British Columbia), that certain officers authorized, permitted, or acquiesced in the release of the impugned disclosures, and that all of the defendants are liable for damages to the putative class. The plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of damages.

In May 2023, in connection with the Company s internal review of the financial reporting matters related to BioSteel Canada, as previously disclosed in the Annual Report (the BioSteel Review ), the Company voluntarily self-reported to the SEC that the timing and amount of revenue recognition in the BioSteel Canada segment were under review. As a result of self-reporting the BioSteel Review, the Company is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the SEC. Although the Company is fully cooperating with the SEC and continues to voluntarily respond to requests in connection with this matter, it cannot predict when such matters will be completed or the outcome and potential impact. Any remedial measures, sanctions, fines or penalties, including, but not limited to, financial penalties and awards, injunctive relief and compliance conditions, imposed on the Company in connection with this matter could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to the Restatement of the Prior Financial Statements As a result of self-reporting the BioSteel Review, the Company is the subject of an investigation by the SEC and an ongoing informal inquiry by regulatory authorities in Canada, and it cannot predict the timing of developments, and any adverse outcome of these continuing matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company under Item 1A of the Annual Report. 
 The Company denies any alleged misconduct and liability for each of the claims asserted in the above-noted Court, believes that the defendants/respondents have meritorious defenses to the claims, and expects to vigorously defend the claims, although the Company cannot predict when or how they will be resolved or estimate what the potential loss or range of loss would be, if any. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any other legal proceedings other than described above, the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Please refer to Risk Factors under Item 1A of the Annual Report for further discussion. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 For information regarding factors that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, see the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A in the Annual Report. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report. 
 There can be no certainty that all conditions to the Floating Share Arrangement and the Acreage Amending Agreement will be satisfied or waived. 
 There can be no certainty, nor can the Company provide any assurance, that all conditions precedent contained in the Floating Share Arrangement Agreement and the Acreage Amending Agreement will be satisfied or waived. The Floating Share Arrangement is subject to certain conditions precedent which. There can be no certainty, nor can the Company provide any assurance, that these conditions will be satisfied or, if satisfied, when they will be satisfied. If such conditions precedent are not satisfied, it may result in the acquisition of Acreage not being completed. 
 Acreage s financial statements express doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Acreage s publicly available financial statements as of and for three and six months ended June 30, 2024 filed with the SEC on August 14, 2024 Acreage s June 30, 2024 Financial Statements express doubt about Acreage s ability to continue as a going concern. In particular, Acreage s June 30, 2024 Financial Statements state: [Acreage] had an accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2024, as well as a net loss and negative cash flow from operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt about [Acreage] s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. In the event that Acreage is unable to continue as a going concern, the Acreage Amended Arrangement and the Floating Share Arrangement may not be completed. In the event that the Acreage Amended Arrangement and the Floating Share Arrangement are completed and Acreage is unable to continue as a going concern, this would have a negative impact on Canopy USA s business, financial results and operations and have an adverse impact on the Company s United States strategy, and, ultimately, the Company s financial results and operations. 
 On June 3, 2024, the Company closed the Debt Acquisition pursuant to the credit agreement dated as of December 16, 2021, as amended by the first amendment to credit agreement dated as of on October 24, 2022, and the second amendment to credit agreement dated as of April 28, 2023 (the Prior Acreage Credit Agreement ). The Company entered into various agreements in connection with the Debt Acquisition in order to, among other things, acquire the Acquired Debt in exchange for US 69.8 million in cash and the release of approximately US 30.1 million that was held in escrow pursuant to the option agreement dated November 15, 2022 among a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canopy Growth and the lenders party to the Prior Acreage Credit Agreement. 
 In view of the foregoing, Acreage s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its continued operations, which in turn is dependent upon, among other things, Acreage s ability to meet its financial requirements. There is no assurance that Acreage will be successful in its plans to fund its operations and debt obligations as they become due and payable, which for greater certainty includes its debt obligations in favor of the Company in connection with the Acquired Debt. Accordingly, in the event Acreage cannot satisfy its debt obligations as they become due, the Acquired Debt may not be repaid and the Company may lose the entirety of its investment. In addition, Acreage may be required to terminate or significantly curtail its operations or enter into arrangements with third parties that may require Acreage to relinquish rights to certain aspects of its business and/or dispose of certain assets, which may 
 63 

ultimately result in Acreage not being able to satisfy the conditions in the Acreage Amended Arrangement and the Floating Share Arrangement and the acquisition of Acreage not being completed.
