The Advisory Agreement was most recently renewed by the Company's Board on August 12, 2024 for an additional term until September 15, 2025. The Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of an assignment by the Adviser. The Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party, by vote of the Company s Board, or by a vote of the majority of the Company s outstanding voting units, without penalty upon not less than 60 days prior written notice to the applicable party. If the Advisory Agreement is terminated according to this paragraph, the Company will pay the Adviser a pro-rated portion of the Management Fee and Incentive Fee (each as defined below). Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will: determine the composition of the Company s portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to the Company s portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; 

 identify, evaluate and negotiate the structure of the investments the Company makes (including performing due diligence on the Company s prospective portfolio companies); 

 determine the assets the Company will originate, purchase, retain or sell; 

 close, monitor and administer the investments the Company makes, including the exercise of any rights in the Company s capacity as a lender; and 

 provide the Company such other investment advice, research and related services as the Company may, from time to time, require. 

 The Company pays to the Adviser, quarterly in arrears, a management fee in cash (the Management Fee calculated as follows: (i.e., per annum) of the average gross assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, with the average determined based on the gross assets of the Company as of the end of the three most recently completed calendar months. Gross assets means the amortized cost of portfolio investments of the Company (including portfolio investments purchased with borrowed funds and other forms of leverage, such as Preferred Units, public and private debt issuances, derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and other similar instruments or arrangements) that have not been sold, distributed to the Members, or written off for tax purposes (but reduced by any portion of such cost basis that has been written down to reflect a permanent impairment of value of any portfolio investment), and excluding cash and cash equivalents. The Management Fee payable for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately pro-rated. The Adviser may defer its right to receive current payment of such fee until the Company is notified otherwise. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Management Fees incurred were and , of which remained payable as of September 30, 2024.

 of additional amounts otherwise distributable to Unitholders until such time as the Incentive Fee paid to the Adviser is equal to of the sum of (i) the amount by which the Hurdle exceeds the aggregate capital contributions of the Unitholders in respect of all Units and (ii) the amount of Incentive Fee being paid to the Adviser pursuant to this clause (c); and 

 (d) Thereafter, the Adviser will be entitled to an Incentive Fee equal to of additional amounts otherwise distributable to Unitholders in respect of all Units, with the remaining distributed to the Unitholders. 

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Incentive Fees incurred were and . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Incentive Fees incurred were and . The Company has not made any incentive fee payments to the Adviser, and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's incentive fee payable to the Advisor was and , respectively. For purposes of calculating the Incentive Fee, aggregate contributions shall not include Earnings Balancing Contributions or Late-Closer Contributions, and the distributions to Unitholders shall not include distributions attributable to Late-Closer Contributions. Earnings Balancing Contributions (as such terms are defined in the Company s LLC Agreement) received by the Company will not be treated as amounts distributed to Unitholders for purposes of calculating the Incentive Fee. In addition, if distributions to which a Defaulting Member otherwise would have been entitled have been withheld pursuant to 6.2.4 of the LLC Agreement, the amounts so withheld shall be treated for such purposes as having been distributed to such Defaulting Member (as that term is defined in the LLC Agreement). The amount of any distribution of securities made in kind shall be equal to the fair market value of those securities at the time of distribution determined pursuant to 13.4 of the LLC Agreement. If the Advisory Agreement terminates early for any reason other than (i) the Adviser voluntarily terminating the agreement or (ii) the Company terminating the agreement for cause (as set out in the Advisory Agreement), the Company will be required to pay the Adviser a final incentive fee payment (the Final Incentive Fee Payment ). The Final Incentive Fee Payment will be calculated as of the date the Advisory Agreement is so terminated and will equal the amount of Incentive Fee that would be payable to the Adviser if (A) all of the Company s investments were liquidated for their current value (but without taking into account any unrealized appreciation of any portfolio investment), and any unamortized deferred portfolio investment-related fees were deemed accelerated, (B) the proceeds from such liquidation were used to pay all of the Company s outstanding liabilities, and (C) the remainder were distributed to Unitholders and paid as Incentive Fee in accordance with the waterfall (i.e., clauses (a) through (d)) described above for determining the amount of the Incentive Fee. The Company will make the Final Incentive Fee Payment in cash on or immediately following the date the Advisory Agreement is so terminated. Adviser Return Obligation : After the Company has made its final distribution of assets in connection with its dissolution, if the Adviser has received aggregate payments of Incentive Fees in excess of the amount the Adviser was entitled to receive pursuant to Incentive Fee above, then the Adviser will return to the Company, on or before 90 days after such final distribution of assets, an amount equal to such excess (the Adviser Return Obligation ). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event will the Adviser be required to return to the Company an amount greater than the aggregate Incentive Fees paid to the Adviser, reduced by the excess of (a) the aggregate federal, state and local income tax liability the Adviser incurred in connection with the payment of such Incentive Fees, over (b) an amount equal to the U.S. federal and state tax benefits available to the Adviser by virtue of the payment made by the Adviser pursuant to its Adviser Return Obligation.

 Overview 
 We were formed on May 23, 2017 as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware. We conducted a private offering of our common limited liability company units (the Units to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). 
 On August 18, 2017 Inception Date ), we sold and issued 10 Units at an aggregate purchase price of 1,000 to our investment adviser, TCW Asset Management Company LLC, an affiliate of the TCW Group, Inc. 
 On December 29, 2017, we filed an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a BDC and a RIC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. 
 On April 13, 2018 (the Initial Closing Date ), we began accepting subscription agreements from investors for the private sale of our Units and on January 14, 2019, we completed our fourth and final closing sale of our Units. We have sold 13,734,010 Units for an aggregate offering price of approximately 1.4 billion. Each Unitholder is obligated to contribute capital equal to their Commitment and each Unit s Commitment obligation is 100.00 per Unit. The sale of the Units was made pursuant to subscription agreements entered into by us and each investor. Under the terms of the subscription agreements, we may draw down all or any portion of the undrawn commitment with respect to each Unit generally upon at least ten business days prior written notice to the unitholders. The amount of capital that remains to be drawn down and contributed is referred to as an Undrawn Commitment. 
 We commenced operations during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
 We have several wholly-owned subsidiaries, each a single member Delaware limited liability company. On August 7, 2024, we formed our sixth wholly-owned subsidiary, TCW DL Torcsill LLC, a single member Delaware limited liability company. 
 Our commitment period commenced on the Initial Closing Date and ended on May 16, 2021, which is the later of (a) April 13, 2021, three years from the Initial Closing Date and (b) May 16, 2021, three years from the date in which we first completed an investment. We may complete investment transactions that were significantly in process as of the end of the commitment period and which we reasonably expect to be consummated prior to 90 days after the expiration date of the commitment period. We may also effect follow-on investments up to an aggregate maximum of 10 of Commitments. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income and capital appreciation by providing private capital to middle market companies operating in a broad range of industries primarily in the United States. As our investment period has ended, we will not originate new loans, but may increase credit facilities to existing borrowers or affiliates. Our highly negotiated private investments may include senior secured loans, unsecured senior loans, subordinated and mezzanine loans, convertible securities, notes and other non-convertible debt securities, equity securities, and equity-linked securities such as options and warrants. However, historically, our investment bias has been towards adjustable-rate, senior secured loans. We do not anticipate a secondary market developing for our private investments. The investment philosophy, strategy and approach of the private credit team of the Adviser (the Private Credit Team fka the Direct Lending Team has generally not involved the use of payment-in-kind PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, or similar arrangements. Although the Private Credit Team generally did not originate a significant amount of investments for us with PIK interest features, a number of 
 40 

our current investments do contain PIK due to certain circumstances involving debt restructurings or work-outs. The high concentration of PIK in our current portfolio is primarily a result of the continued wind down of our portfolio. 
 We are primarily focused on investing in senior secured debt obligations, although there may be occasions where the investment may be unsecured. We also consider an equity investment as the primary security, in combination with a debt obligation, or as a part of total return strategy. Our investments are mostly in corporations, partnerships or other business entities. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we may co-invest with other investors and/or strategic partners indirectly in a company through a joint venture partnership or other special purpose vehicle. While we invest primarily in U.S. companies, there are certain instances where we invested in companies domiciled elsewhere. 
 Expenses 
 We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided through the Amended and Restated Administration Agreement, dated as of September 25, 2018 (the Administration Agreement and the Investment Advisory Agreement, dated as of December 29, 2017, (the Advisory Agreement ).

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Investments at Fair Value 
 Investments which we hold for which market quotes are not readily available or are not considered reliable are valued at fair value according to procedures approved by the Board of Directors (the Board based on similar instruments, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Adviser as the "valuation designee" with respect to the fair valuation of the Company's portfolio securities, subject to oversight by and periodic reporting to the Board. 
 Fair Value Hierarchy: Assets and liabilities are classified by us into three levels based on valuation inputs used to determine fair value: 
 Level 1 values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets. 
 42 

Level 2 values are based on significant observable market inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets and quoted prices in inactive markets or other market observable inputs. 
 Level 3 values are based on significant unobservable inputs that reflect our determination of assumptions that market participants might reasonably use in valuing the assets. 
 Categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. 
 Level 1 Assets (Investments) : The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows: 
 Equity, (Level 1) , generally includes common stock valued at the closing price on the primary exchange in which the security trades. 
 Level 2 Assets (Investments) : The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows: 
 Equity, (Level 2) , generally includes warrants valued using quotes for comparable investments. 
 Level 3 Assets (Investments): The following valuation techniques and significant inputs are used to determine the fair value of investments in private debt and equity for which reliable market quotations are not available. Some of the inputs are independently observable however, a significant portion of the inputs and the internal assumptions applied are unobservable. 
 Debt, (Level 3) , includes investments in privately originated senior secured debt. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. An income method approach incorporating a weighted average cost of capital and discount rate or a market method approach using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets are generally used to determine fair value, though some cases use an enterprise value waterfall method. Valuation may also include a shadow rating method. Standard pricing inputs include but are not limited to the financial health of the issuer, place in the capital structure, value of other issuer debt, credit, industry, and market risk and events. 
 Equity , (Level 3), includes common stock, preferred stock and warrants. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A market approach is generally used to determine fair value. Pricing inputs include, but are not limited to, financial health and relevant business developments of the issuer; EBITDA; market multiples of comparable companies; comparable market transactions and recent trades or transactions; issuer, industry and market events; and contractual or legal restrictions on the sale of the security. When a Black-Scholes pricing model is used it follows the income approach. The pricing model takes into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputs, including: time value, implied volatility, equity prices and interest rates. A liquidity discount based on current market expectations, future events, minority ownership position and the period management reasonably expects to hold the investment may be applied. 
 Pricing inputs and weightings applied to determine value require subjective determination. Accordingly, valuations do not necessarily represent the amounts that may eventually be realized from sales or other dispositions of investments.

 Total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 36.2 million and 34.4 million, respectively. Total investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 106.0 million and 112.5 million, respectively. 
 44 

The increase in total investment income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to an increase in interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in total investment income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in the par value of debt investments in our portfolio, which decreased to 887.8 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 971.5 million as of September 30, 2023. This decrease in the par value of our investments was partially offset by an increase in interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net investment income 
 Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 18.2 million and 25.3 million, respectively. Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 103.1 million and 77.6 million, respectively. 
 Our net investment income decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in total expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was partially offset by the increase in total investment income described above. The increase in total expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in incentive fees and interest expense incurred on repurchase transactions, partially offset by a decrease in interest and credit facilities expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our net investment income increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to a decrease in incentive fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was partially offset by the decrease in total investment income described above.

Our total expenses were 18.0 million and 9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our total expenses included management fees attributed to the Adviser of 3.5 million and 3.7 million; and incentive fees of 7.5 million and (2.8) million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Our total expenses were 2.9 million and 34.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our total expenses included management fees attributed to the Adviser of 10.5 million and 11.6 million; and incentive fees of (28.9) million and 0.3 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The increase in total expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increase in incentive fees and interest expense incurred on repurchase transactions during the current period. Incentive fees increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to unrealized gains recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to unrealized losses recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense incurred on repurchase transactions increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as we entered into repurchase agreements during the three months ended September 30, 2024 but did not enter into any during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in incentive fees and interest expense incurred on repurchase transactions was partially offset by a decrease in interest and credit facilities expenses due to a lower average outstanding balance during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in total expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in incentive fees during the current period. Incentive fees decreased during the 
 45 

nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the reversal of previously accrued incentive fees. The Fund had realized and unrealized losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which resulted in a reduction of incentive fee payable to the Adviser as of September 30, 2024. The decrease in incentive fees was coupled with a decrease in interest and credit facilities expenses due to a lower average outstanding balance partially offset by a higher weighted average interest rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in these expenses was partially offset by an increase in interest expense incurred on repurchase transactions as we entered into repurchase agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 but did not enter into any during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net realized (loss) gain on investments 
 Our net realized loss on investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 18.7 million and 0, respectively. Our net realized (loss) gain on investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 18.7) and 2.8 million, respectively. Our net realized loss during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is fully attributable to our disposition of the RL Parent Holdings LLC (fka Red Lobster Management, LLC) term loan and incremental term loan. We did not have a realized (loss) gain during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as none of our investments were disposed of during the period. Our net realized gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is fully attributable to our partial sale of the Mondee Holdings, LLC common stock. 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on investments 
 Our net change in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 12.3 million and 25.0) million, respectively.

The relative increase in Net increase in Members Capital from operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to net realized and unrealized losses during the current quarter of 5.7 million, compared to net realized and unrealized losses of 25.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and was partially offset by lower net investment income, as described above. 
 Our Net increase in Members Capital from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 37.0 million and 12.8 million, respectively. The relative increase in Net increase in Members Capital from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due higher net investment

income, as described above, which was partially offset by net realized and unrealized losses during the current period of 66.1 million, compared to net realized and unrealized losses of of 64.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 On April 13, 2018, we completed the first closing of the sale of our Units to persons not affiliated with the Adviser. We also commenced operations during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. On January 14, 2019, we completed our fourth and final closing sale of our Units. We generate cash from (1) drawing down capital in respect of Units, (2) cash flows from investments and operations and (3) borrowings from banks or other lenders. 
 Our primary use of cash is for (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (2) the cost of operations (including expenses, the Management Fee, the Incentive Fee, and any indemnification obligations), (3) debt service of any borrowings and (4) cash distributions to the Unitholders.

On May 10, 2018, we entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (the Natixis Credit Agreement among the Company, as borrower, and Natixis, New York Branch Natixis ), as administrative agent and the committed lenders, conduit lenders and funding agents. The Natixis Credit Agreement provided for a revolving credit line (the Natixis Revolving Credit Facility of up to 150.0 million (the Natixis Maximum Commitment ), subject to the lesser of the Natixis Borrowing Base assets or the Natixis Maximum Commitment. The Natixis Borrowing Base assets equal the sum of a percentage of unfunded commitments from certain classes of eligible investors in the Company (the Natixis Available Commitment ). 
 The Natixis Maximum Commitment may be periodically increased in amounts designated by the Company, up to an aggregate amount of 1 billion. The maturity date of the Natixis Credit Agreement was May 10, 2021. On May 10, 2021, the Company exercised its option to extend the maturity date of the Natixis Credit Agreement to May 9, 2022. On March 15, 2022, the Company exercised its last available option to extend the Natixis Credit Agreement maturity date from May 9, 2022 to May 9, 2023. Borrowings under the Natixis Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to either (a) a base rate calculated in a customary manner plus 0.75 or (b) an adjusted eurodollar rate calculated in a customary manner plus 1.75 . As of December 31, 2020, the Natixis Maximum Commitment was 280.0 million. On March 10, 2021, we further reduced the Natixis Maximum Commitment to 250.0 million. 
 On January 10, 2023, we entered into a Sixth Amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement with Natixis (the "Sixth Amended Revolving Credit Agreement"). The Sixth Amended Revolving Credit Agreement replaces the Eurocurrency Rate with a Daily Simple SOFR Rate, Term SOFR Rate and Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (each as defined in the Sixth Amended Revolving Credit Agreement) for purposes of calculating interest on the loan. Each Term SOFR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for such Interest Period plus the interest rate spread or "Applicable Margin." Each Daily SOFR Loan will bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus the Applicable Margin. The Term SOFR Loan and Daily SOFR Loan have an Applicable Margin of 1.75 . 
 On May 9, 2023, we entered into the Seventh Amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement with Natixis (the "Seventh Amended Revolving Credit Agreement"). The Seventh Amended Revolving Credit Agreement (1) removed the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for purposes of calculating interest on the loan but kept the Daily Simple SOFR and Term SOFR rates as is; (2) updated the Applicable Margin from 0.75 to 1.15 for Base Rate Loans and from 1.75 to 2.15 for all other loan types; (3) added a minimum usage fee whereby the Company is charged 2.15 on undrawn amounts that are less than 50 of the Maximum Commitment; (4) modified the unused fees such that if usage is between 0 and 30 , the Company is charged 0.75 , 0.55 if usage is between 30 and 50 , and 0.40 if usage is greater than 50 ; and (5) extended the maturity date of the Natixis Revolving Credit Facility 364 days to May 9, 2024. 
 49 

On May 9, 2024, we entered into the Eighth Amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement with Natixis (the Eighth Amended Revolving Credit Agreement ). The Eighth Amended Revolving Credit Agreement: (1) updated the Applicable Margin from 1.15 to 1.50 for Base Rate Loans and from 2.15 to 2.50 for all other loan types; (2) extended the Stated Maturity Date (previously defined as May 9, 2024) of the Natixis Revolving Credit Facility 183 days to November 8, 2024; (3) updated the definition of Maturity Date to be the earlier of the Stated Maturity Date or 45 days after a Maturity Event which is defined as one or more of the following occurring: (a) Special Member (NLGI US Private Debt Fund I) elects to "opt-out" and have its membership interest redeemed during the next scheduled redemption date; (b) Rated Included Investors (as defined in the Natixis Credit Agreement) representing 8 or more of Unfunded Commitments elect to "opt-out"and have their membership interest redeemed during the next scheduled redemption date; or (c) Included Investors (as defined in the Natixis Credit Agreement) representing 8 or more of Unfunded Commitments elect to "opt-out"and have their membership interest redeemed during the next scheduled redemption date; and (4) allowed us to extend the Stated Maturity Date up to 3 months after the then effective Stated Maturity Date no more than 2 times. 
 On July 30, 2024, we entered into the Ninth Amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement with Natixis (the Ninth Amended Revolving Credit Agreement ). The Ninth Amended Revolving Credit Agreement: (1) added the definition of Exchange Offer which means any exchange offer with respect to any membership interests in connection with a Reorganization (2) updated to the definition of Maturity Event to Maturity Event Date which is defined as when the Borrower proceeds with a Reorganization, the date 45 days prior to the date of the delivery of an Exchange Offer to any investor, unless extended by the lenders in their sole discretion and (3) requires consent of all lenders for the Borrower to deliver any Exchange Offer to investors or permit any Reorganization to be deemed effective. 
 The Natixis Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a first priority security interest, subject to customary exceptions, in (i) all of the capital commitments of the investors in the Company, (ii) our right to make capital calls, receive payment of capital contributions from the investors and enforce payment of the capital commitments and capital contributions under our operating agreement and (iii) a cash collateral account into which the capital contributions from the investors are made. The Natixis Revolving Credit Facility may be terminated, and any outstanding amounts thereunder may become due and payable, should we fail to satisfy certain covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with such covenants. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Natixis Borrowing Base assets were more than the Natixis Maximum Commitment. A summary of amounts outstanding and available under the Natixis Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):

On January 29, 2019, TCW DL VII Financing LLC (the Borrower or TCW DL VII Financing ), a newly-formed, wholly-owned, special purpose financing subsidiary of ours, entered into a senior secured credit facility (the PNC Credit Facility and together with the Natixis Revolving Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities pursuant to a credit and security agreement (the PNC Credit Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association PNC ), as facility agent, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and State Street Bank and Trust Company, as collateral agent. 
 Under the PNC Credit Facility, the lenders have agreed to extend credit to the Borrower in an aggregate principal amount of up to 400.0 million of revolving and term loans (the PNC Maximum Commitment ), subject to compliance with a borrowing base (the PNC Borrowing Base ). The PNC Maximum Commitment may be periodically increased in amounts designated by the Borrower up to an aggregate principal amount of 900.0 million, subject to lender consent and obtaining commitments for the increase. The Borrower may make borrowings of (i) a revolving loan (the PNC Revolving Credit Facility and together with the Natixis Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities under the PNC Credit Facility during the period commencing January 29, 2019 and ending on January 29, 2022 and (ii) a term loan (the PNC Term Loan under the PNC Credit Facility during the period which commenced on January 29, 2019 and ended on January 29, 2020, unless, in the case of (i) and (ii), there is an earlier termination of the PNC Credit Facility or event of default thereunder. The PNC Credit Facility will mature on January 29, 2024. Loans under the PNC Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate of interest per annum equal to, at the Borrower s option, either (i) three-month LIBOR plus the facility margin of 2.30 per annum or (ii) the Base Rate plus the facility margin of 2.30 per annum. 
 On April 11, 2019, the Borrower amended and restated the PNC Credit Agreement (as amended, the Amended PNC Credit Agreement for the PNC Credit Facility. The Amended PNC Credit Agreement, among other things, (a) increased the total commitments under the PNC Credit Facility from 400.0 million to 600.0 million (the Amended PNC Maximum Commitment 
 50 

and (b) made certain modifications to the calculation of the borrowing base under the prior facility, including the eligibility requirements of collateral obligations pledged under the PNC Credit Facility and loan portfolio concentration limits. 
 On March 17, 2020, the Borrower further amended and restated the Amended PNC Credit Agreement (as further amended the Second Amended PNC Credit Agreement ). The Second Amended PNC Credit Agreement, among other things, increased the total commitments under the PNC Credit Facility from 600.0 million to 795.0 million (the Second Amended PNC Maximum Commitment ). The Second Amended PNC Maximum Commitment may be periodically increased in amounts designated by the Borrower up to an aggregate principal amount of 900.0 million, subject to lender consent and obtaining commitments for the increase. The Borrower may make borrowings of (i) revolving loans under the PNC Credit Facility during the period commencing January 29, 2019 and ending on January 29, 2022 and (ii) term loans under the PNC Credit Facility during the period commencing January 29, 2019 and ended on March 17, 2020, unless, there is an earlier termination of the PNC Credit Facility or event of default thereunder. On June 19, 2020, the Second Amended PNC Maximum Commitment was increased from 795.0 million to 825.0 million. On November 15, 2021, the Second Amended PNC Maximum Commitment was decreased from 825.0 million to 700.0 million. 
 On January 31, 2022 (the first business day after January 29, 2022), the Borrower's ability to make borrowings under the PNC Revolving Credit Facility expired and the then outstanding PNC Revolving Credit Facility borrowings of 295.5 million converted into outstanding borrowings under the PNC Term Loan. In connection with such conversion, repayments on outstanding borrowings under the PNC Term Loan will correspondingly reduce the PNC Maximum Commitment. The PNC Credit Facility will mature on January 29, 2024. 
 On October 27, 2022, the Borrower amended and restated the Amended PNC Credit Agreement (as further amended the Third Amended PNC Credit Agreement ). The Third Amended PNC Credit Agreement, among other things, removed reference to LIBOR rates and the related definitions and added reference to SOFR rates and the related definitions in which the Borrower may now elect a fluctuating rate of interest that is based on SOFR rather than LIBOR. Loans under the PNC Credit Facility will bear interest at a fluctuating rate of interest per annum equal to, at the Borrower s option, either (i) SOFR rate plus the sum of the facility margin of 2.3 and SOFR adjustment per annum or (ii) the Base Rate plus the facility margin of 2.30 per annum. 
 On December 6, 2023, the Borrower entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Third Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement with PNC Amendment No.1 to Third Amended PNC Credit Agreement ). The Amendment No.1 to Third Amended PNC Credit Agreement (1) updated the Facility Margin Level from 2.30 to 2.75 and removed the SOFR adjustment from the calculation of interest on borrowings; (2) extended the Final Maturity Date 366 days from January 29, 2024 to January 29, 2025; (3) changed the total commitments under the PNC Term Loan to 265.0 million (the total outstanding balance as of the date of the amendment). 
 The Borrower s obligations under the PNC Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in all of the assets of the Borrower, including its portfolio of loans that has been contributed by the Company to the Borrower in exchange for 100 of the membership interests of the Borrower and any payments received in respect of such loans. The Company may contribute or sell to the Borrower additional loans from time to time after the closing date, which shall be pledged in favor of the lenders under the PNC Credit Facility. 
 Under the PNC Credit Facility, the Borrower has made customary representations and warranties and is required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The PNC Credit Facility also includes events of default that are customary for similar credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Borrower was in compliance with such covenants. 
 Borrowings of the Borrower are non-recourse to us but are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements and considered our borrowings for purposes of complying with the asset coverage requirements under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

We may, from time to time, enter into repurchase agreements with Barclays Bank PLC Barclays ), whereby the we sell to Barclays our short-term investments and concurrently enter into an agreement to repurchase the same investments at an agreed-upon price at a future date, generally within 30-days (each, a Repurchase Transaction ). 
 
 These Repurchase Transactions meet the criteria for secured borrowings. Accordingly, the short-term investments remain on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as an asset, and we record a liability to reflect our repurchase obligation to Barclays (the Repurchase Obligation ). The Repurchase Obligation is secured by the short-term investments that are the subject of the repurchase agreement. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into Repurchase Transactions with Barclays on January 2, 2024 April 1, 2024, and July 1, 2024 which settled on January 25, 2024, April 25, 2024, and July 25, 2024, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not enter into any Repurchase Transactions. 
 
 52 

We had no outstanding Repurchase Obligations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Interest expense incurred under these Repurchase Transactions was 0.7 million and 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense incurred under these Repurchase Transactions was 1.3 million and 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 100 of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, such as SOFR and Prime Rate. The interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to three months. As of September 30, 2024, the percentage of our floating rate debt investments that bore interest based on an interest rate floor was 0.0 . Floating rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to three months only if the index exceeds the floor. 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. We assess our portfolio companies periodically to determine whether such companies will be able to continue making interest payments in the event that interest rates increase. There can be no assurances that the portfolio companies will be able to meet their contractual obligations at any or all levels of increases in interest rates. 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income (excluding the related incentive compensation impact) of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure (dollar amounts in thousands):

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(i) Benchmark Replacement . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Facility Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any 

166 

setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Facility Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Facility Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause 
 (2) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Facility Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Facility Document so long as the Facility Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Controlling Lenders. 
 (ii) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes . In connection with the implementation and administration of a Benchmark Replacement, the Facility Agent shall have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Facility Documents, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Facility Document. 

(iii) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations . The Facility Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 12.01(c)(iv) below and (v) the commencement of any Benchmark Unavailability Period.

(iv) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Facility Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Facility Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer 

167 

representative, then the Facility Agent may modify the definition of Interest Accrual 

168 

Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Facility Agent may modify the definition of Interest Accrual Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 
 (v) Benchmark Unavailability Period . Upon the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a SOFR Rate Advance, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Rate Advances to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for an Advance of or conversion to Base Rate Advances. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Base Rate. 

(vi) Definitions . As used in this Section 12.01(c) : 

Available Tenor means, as of any date of determination and with respect to the then-current Benchmark, as applicable, (x) if the then current Benchmark is a term rate or is based on a term rate, any tenor for such Benchmark that is or may be used for determining the length of an Interest Accrual Period pursuant to this Agreement as of such date and not including, for the avoidance of doubt, any tenor for such Benchmark that is then-removed from the definition of Interest Accrual Period pursuant to clause (iv) of this Section 12.01(c) , or (y) if the then current Benchmark is not a term rate nor based on a term rate, any payment period for interest calculated with reference to such Benchmark pursuant to this Agreement as of such date. 
 
 Benchmark means, initially, the Term SOFR Rate or Daily Simple SOFR; provided that if a Benchmark Transition Event, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred with respect to the Term SOFR Rate, Daily Simple SOFR or the then-current Benchmark, then Benchmark means the applicable Benchmark Replacement to the extent that such Benchmark Replacement has replaced such prior benchmark rate pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 12.01(c) . Any reference to Benchmark shall include, as applicable, the published component used in the calculation thereof. 
 Benchmark Replacement means, for any Available Tenor, the first alternative set forth in the order below that can be determined by the Facility Agent for the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date: 
 (1) Daily Simple SOFR; 

169 

(2) the sum of: (a) the alternate benchmark rate that has been selected by the Facility Agent and the Borrower as the replacement for the then-current Benchmark for the applicable Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a replacement benchmark rate or the mechanism for determining such a rate by the Relevant Governmental Body or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a benchmark rate as a replacement for the then- current Benchmark for U.S. dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities at such time and (b) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment; 

170 

provided that, if the Benchmark Replacement plus the SOFR Adjustment as determined pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above would be less than the Floor, the Benchmark Replacement will be deemed to be the Floor for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Facility Documents, and provided further , that any such Benchmark Replacement shall be administratively feasible as determined by the Facility Agent in its sole discretion. 
 Benchmark Replacement Adjustment means, with respect to any replacement of the then-current Benchmark with an Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for any applicable Available Tenor for any setting of such Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement, the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) that has been selected by the Facility Agent and the Borrower for the applicable Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement by the Relevant Governmental Body on the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for U.S. dollar- denominated syndicated credit facilities; 
 
 provided that, if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate, more than one tenor of such Benchmark is available as of the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date and the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement will not be a term rate, the Available Tenor of such Benchmark for purposes of this definition of Benchmark Replacement Adjustment shall be deemed to be the Available Tenor that has approximately the same length (disregarding business day adjustments) as the payment period for interest calculated with reference to such Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement. 
 Benchmark Replacement Date means a date and time determined by the Facility Agent, which date shall be at the end of an Interest Accrual Period and no later than the earliest to occur of the following events with respect to the then- current Benchmark: 
 171 

(1) in the case of clause (1) or (2) of the definition of Benchmark Transition Event, the later of (a) the date of the public statement or publication of information referenced therein and (b) the date on which the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) permanently or indefinitely ceases to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or 

(2) in the case of clause (3) of the definition of Benchmark Transition Event, the first date on which such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) has been determined and announced by or on behalf of the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) to be no longer representative; provided that such non-representativeness will be determined by reference to the most recent statement or publication referenced in such clause (3) and even if any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) continues to be provided on such date. 

For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if the event giving rise to the Benchmark Replacement Date occurs on the same day as, but earlier than, the Reference Time in respect of any determination, the Benchmark Replacement Date will be deemed to have occurred prior to the Reference Time for such determination and (ii) the Benchmark Replacement Date will be deemed to have occurred in the case of clause (1) or (2) with respect to any Benchmark upon the occurrence of the applicable event or events set forth therein with respect to all then-current Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof). 
 Benchmark Transition Event means the occurrence of one or more of the following events with respect to any then-current Benchmark: 
 (1) a public statement or publication of information by or on behalf of the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) announcing that such administrator has ceased or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof), permanently or indefinitely, provided that, at the time of such statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); 

(2) a public statement or publication of information by an Authority having jurisdiction over the Facility Agent, the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof), the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, an insolvency official with jurisdiction over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), a 

172 

resolution authority with 

173 

jurisdiction over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component) or a court or an entity with similar insolvency or resolution authority over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), which states that the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component) has ceased or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) permanently or indefinitely, provided that, at the time of such statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or 
 (3) a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) or an Authority having jurisdiction over the Facility Agent announcing that all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) are no longer representative. 

For the avoidance of doubt, a Benchmark Transition Event will be deemed to have occurred with respect to any Benchmark if a public statement or publication of information set forth above has occurred with respect to each then-current Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof). 
 Benchmark Unavailability Period means the period (if any) (x) beginning at the time that a Benchmark Replacement Date pursuant to clauses (1) or (2) of that definition has occurred if, at such time, no Benchmark Replacement has replaced the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Facility Document in accordance with this Section 12.01(c) and (y) ending at the time that a Benchmark Replacement has replaced the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Facility Document in accordance with this Section 12.01(c) . 
 Corresponding Tenor with respect to any Available Tenor means, as applicable, either a tenor (including overnight) or an interest payment period having approximately the same length (disregarding business day adjustment) as such Available Tenor. 
 
 Floor means the benchmark rate floor, if any, provided in this Agreement initially (as of the execution of this Agreement, the modification, amendment or renewal of this Agreement or otherwise) with respect to the Term SOFR Rate or Daily Simple SOFR, or, if no floor is specified, zero. 
 
 Reference Time means, with respect to any setting of the then-current Benchmark, the time determined by the Facility Agent in its reasonable discretion. 
 Relevant Governmental Body means the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or a committee 
 174 

officially endorsed or convened by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or any successor thereto. 
 Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement means the applicable Benchmark Replacement excluding the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment.

If to any other Lender:	As provided in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to 
 which such other Lender becomes a Lender hereunder. 
 Section 12.03 Taxes. 
 (a) Any and all payments by or on behalf of the Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes shall be made, in accordance with this Agreement, free and clear of and without deduction for Taxes unless such deduction is required by law (or by the interpretation or administration thereof). If the Borrower shall be required by law (or by the interpretation or 

181 

administration thereof) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable by it hereunder, under any Note or under any other Facility Document to any Secured Party, (i) if any such deductions are in respect of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 12.03 such Secured Party receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no deductions in respect of Indemnified Taxes been made, 
 (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, and (iii) the Borrower shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Authority in accordance with Applicable Law. 
 (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to timely pay any present or future stamp, court, intangible, recording, filing or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made by the Borrower hereunder, under the Notes or under any other Facility Document or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, the Notes or under any other Facility Document except any such Taxes that are Other Connection Taxes imposed with respect to an assignment (other than an assignment made pursuant to Section 12.03(h)) (hereinafter referred to as Other Taxes ). 

(c) Borrower agrees to indemnify each of the Secured Parties for the full amount of Indemnified Taxes (including any Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 12.03 ), together with all reasonable costs and expenses arising therefrom, paid by any Secured Party in respect of the Borrower, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted. Payments by the Borrower pursuant to this indemnification shall be made promptly following the date the Secured Party makes written demand therefor, which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate describing in reasonable detail the basis thereof. Such certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(d) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Facility Agent, within 10 Business Days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Facility Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.06 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Facility Agent in connection with any this Agreement or the Notes, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Facility Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Facility Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or the Notes or otherwise payable by the Facility Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Facility Agent under this paragraph (d) . 

(e) Promptly after the date of any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes, the Borrower will furnish to each Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by the relevant Authority evidencing payment thereof (or other evidence of payment as may be reasonably satisfactory to such Agent). 

182 

(f) If a Secured Party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 12.03 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to Section 12.03(a) ), it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such Secured Party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund). Borrower, upon the request of such Secured Party, shall repay to such Secured Party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that such Secured Party is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the Secured Party be required to pay any amount to Borrower pursuant to this paragraph 

183 

(f) the payment of which would place the Secured Party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Secured Party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any Secured Party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
 (g) (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower and the Facility Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Facility Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Facility Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Facility Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Facility Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Facility Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 12.03(g)(ii)(A) , (B) and (D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 

(A) any Lender that is a United States Person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Facility Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Facility Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 

(B) any Lender that is not a United States Person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) (such Lender, a Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Facility Agent (in such number of copies as shall be 

184 

requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Facility Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
 (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under this Agreement, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, 

U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and 
 (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under this Agreement, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; 
 (ii) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;

The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. An Advance (and a Note, if any, evidencing the same) may be assigned or sold in whole or in part only by registration of such assignment or sale on the Register (and each Note, if any, shall expressly so provide).

If a Borrower Party fails to give a timely notice requesting a continuation of a Term SOFR Loan, then the applicable Loan shall be continued as a Term SOFR Loan with an Interest Period of one (1) month, and such continuation shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Term SOFR 

43 

Loan. If a Borrower Party fails to specify an Interest Period with respect to a Term SOFR Loan, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month. 
 (b) Administrative Agent Notification . Following receipt of a Loan Notice, Administrative Agent shall promptly, but in any event on the date of receipt of such Loan Notice, if such Loan Notice is received by Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., notify each Funding Agent of the amount (and currency) of its Lender Group s Applicable Percentage of the applicable Syndicated Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by a Borrower Party, Administrative Agent shall notify each Funding Agent of the details of any automatic continuation of Term SOFR Loans described in the preceding subsection. 

(c) Conduit Lender Determination and Committed Lender Commitment . Upon receipt of a Loan Notice with respect to Syndicated Loans funded at the CP Rate from Administrative Agent, each Funding Agent shall request the Conduit Lender (if any) in its Lender Group to make the Syndicated Loan, and such Conduit Lender may from time to time during the Availability Period, in its sole discretion, agree or decline to make the Syndicated Loan. At no time will any Conduit Lender have any obligation to fund a Syndicated Loan or participate in any Letter of Credit or Swingline Loans. At all times on and after the Conduit Investment Termination Date for a Conduit Lender, or if Conduit Lender has failed for whatever reason to fund its portion of a Borrowing in full, all Loans shall be made by the Committed Lenders of such Conduit Lender s Lender Group. At any time when a Conduit Lender has rejected a request for Syndicated Loan (it being understood that if a Conduit Lender does not fund any Syndicated Loan in relation to which all of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 7.02 have been satisfied on the date set forth in the applicable Loan Notice, such Conduit Lender shall be deemed to have rejected the request for Syndicated Loan), such Conduit Lender s Funding Agent shall so notify the Committed Lenders in such Conduit Lender s Lender Group and such Committed Lenders shall make such Syndicated Loan in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.02(c) or elsewhere in this Credit Agreement to the contrary, no Committed Lender shall be obligated to provide Administrative Agent or any Borrower Party with funds in connection with a Syndicated Loan in an amount that would result in such Committed Lender s Principal Obligation exceeding its Commitment then in effect by any such Committed Lender as a Liquidity Provider under a Liquidity Agreement, and all Loans funded by a Conduit Lender shall be CP Rate Loans. 

(d) Reserved . 

(e) Tranches . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Borrower Parties shall not have the right to have more than seven (7) Term SOFR Loans (other than Swingline Loans) in the aggregate outstanding hereunder at any one time during the Availability Period. 

(f) Continuations and Conversions of Loans and Automatic Continuation of CP Rate Loans . Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term SOFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Term SOFR Loan. During the existence of an Event of Default or Default under Section 11.01(a) , 11.01(g) and 11.01(h) , no Base Rate Loans, Daily SOFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans may be requested as or converted to or continued as Term SOFR Loans or Daily SOFR Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, (i) Daily Simple SOFR and Term SOFR Loans may be converted to Base Rate Loans during the existence of an Event of Default or Default under Section 11.01(a) , 11.01(g) and 11.01(h) and (ii) Term SOFR Loans may be continued as Term SOFR Loans during the existence of an Event of Default 

44 

or Default under Section 11.01(a) , 11.01(g) and 11.01(h) , in each case, unless Administrative Agent has otherwise accelerated the Obligations or exercised other rights that terminate the Commitments under Section 11.02 . Any CP Rate Loan shall automatically continue as a CP Rate Loan without any further action of any Borrower Party. 
 2.03 Minimum Loan Amounts . Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Syndicated Loans shall be in a principal amount that is an integral multiple of 100,000 and not less than 

1,000,000, and each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Base Rate Loans shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of 100,000 and not less than 500,000; provided , however , that a Base Rate Loan may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments or in an aggregate amount that is required for the reimbursement of a Letter of Credit under Section 2.08(c) . 
 2.04 Funding . 

(a) Funding by Committed Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Except with respect to Swingline Loans, which are addressed in Section 2.07 , each Conduit Lender and each Committed Lender, as the case may be, shall, in accordance with the terms hereof, on any Loan Date make the proceeds of its Applicable Percentage of each Borrowing available to Administrative Agent in Dollars at Administrative Agent s Office for the applicable currency for the account of the appropriate Borrower Party (or, if otherwise agreed between such Lender and such Borrower Party and upon fulfillment of all applicable conditions set forth herein, directly to such Borrower Party as specified in the Loan Notice, or, if requested by such Borrower Party in the Loan Notice, shall wire transfer such funds as requested) no later than 2:00 p.m. in each case on the Loan Date in Same Day Funds, and upon fulfillment of all applicable conditions set forth herein, Administrative Agent shall promptly deposit such proceeds in Same Day Funds in such Borrower Party s account at Administrative Agent specified in the Loan Notice, or, if requested by such Borrower Party in the Loan Notice, shall wire transfer such funds as requested; provided , however , that (i) if, in connection with a particular Credit Extension, the 2:00 p.m. time in this sentence is not met as a result of an operational or technical error, issue or oversight, then the 2:00 p.m. time in this sentence shall instead be 3:00 p.m. and (ii) if a single entity is the only Lender, such Lender may wire such funds directly to the Borrower Party (or as directed by the Borrower Party) as specified in the Loan Notice. The failure of any Committed Lender to advance the proceeds of its respective share of any Borrowing required to be advanced hereunder shall not relieve any other Committed Lender of its obligation to advance the proceeds of its Applicable Percentage of any Borrowing required to be advanced hereunder. Absent contrary written notice from a Funding Agent prior to the proposed Loan Date that a Conduit Lender or a Committed Lender in such Lender Group will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender s share, as applicable, of such Borrowing, Administrative Agent may assume that each Committed Lender and each Conduit Lender, as the case may be, has made its Applicable Percentage of the requested Borrowing available to Administrative Agent on the applicable Loan Date and in the applicable currency, and Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption (but is not required to), make available to the appropriate Borrower Party a corresponding amount. 

(b) Obligations of Committed Lenders Several . The obligations of the Committed Lenders hereunder to make Syndicated Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 13.06(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Committed Lender to make any Syndicated Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 13.06(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Committed Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such 

45 

date, and no Committed Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Committed Lender to so make its Syndicated Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 13.06(c) . 
 (c) Commercial Paper . Each Conduit Lender confirms that, to the extent permitted by its commercial paper program documentation, it intends to fund all Loans hereunder through the issuance of its Commercial Paper at all times prior to the occurrence of a Liquidity Event, the termination date specified in its Liquidity Agreement, an Event of Default or certain other circumstances occurring in the financial or Commercial Paper markets in general or with respect to the Loan Documents, or any Borrower Party in particular which, in the opinion of such, Conduit Lender or its Funding Agent or Administrator, make funding the Loans through the issuance of Commercial Paper reasonably inadvisable. 

2.05 Interest . 

(a) Interest Rate . Subject to the provisions of clause (b) below: 

(i) (A) each CP Rate Loan funded by a Conduit Lender through the issuance of Commercial Paper shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the CP Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for CP Rate Loans, and (B) each CP Rate Loan funded by a Conduit Lender through its Liquidity Provider shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate set forth in clause (b) of the definition of Term SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin or, if such rate is not available, the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, each in accordance with Section 2.02 , for each day in such Interest Period prior to the day on which such funding has been refinanced through the issuance of Commercial Paper and at the CP Rate for the remainder of such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for CP Rate Loans;

(iii) each Daily SOFR Loan will bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus the Applicable Margin in accordance with Section 2.02 ; and 

(iv) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.02 . 

(b) Default Rate . 

(i) If any amount of principal of the Obligations is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), then (in lieu of the interest rate provided in Section 2.05(a) above) such amount shall bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate. 

(ii) If any amount (other than principal of the Obligations) payable by Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any 

46 

applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders (in lieu of the interest rate provided in Section 2.05(a) above), such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate. 
 (iii) Upon the request of Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, then (in lieu of the interest rate provided in Section 2.05(a) above) the principal amount of the Obligations shall bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate, from the date of the occurrence of such Event of Default until such Event of Default is cured or is waived. 

(c) Initial Benchmark Conforming Changes . In connection with the use or administration of any Benchmark, Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document. Administrative Agent will promptly notify Borrower and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration of any Benchmark. 

2.06 Determination of Rate and Billing . Each change in the rate of interest for any Borrowing or any portion thereof shall become effective, without prior notice to the Borrower Parties, automatically as of the opening of business of Administrative Agent on the date of said change. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and the Committed Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Term SOFR Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the Term SOFR Rate and Daily Simple SOFR by Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The applicable CP Rate shall be determined for each Conduit Lender by the applicable Funding Agent and reported, together with a calculation of any accrued interest and fees for the applicable period (but excluding any fee payable pursuant to Section 2.11 payable to such Conduit Lender on any Interest Payment Date, to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by 11:00 a.m. five (5) Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date; provided that, if such Funding Agent fails to report the CP Rate to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by such time, the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to use the interest rate being paid to the non-Conduit Lenders for such applicable period for any such non-reporting Conduit Lender provided that such amount paid to any non-reporting Conduit Lender shall be trued-up on the following applicable Interest Payment Date upon five (5) Business Days prior notice). The Administrative Agent will bill the Borrower on behalf of all Lenders with respect to interest on Daily SOFR Loans, Term SOFR Loans, Base Rate Loans, and CP Rate Loans.

(i) the Principal Obligation shall not exceed the Available Commitment; (ii) no Committed Lender s Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed such Committed Lender s Commitment (minus any amounts funded in respect of a Loan hereunder (but not used to fund such Loan and

accordingly not included in the Principal Obligation) by any such Committed Lender as a Liquidity Provider under a Liquidity Agreement); (iii) the Principal Obligation of each Lender Group shall not exceed such Lender Group s Lender Group Limit; and (iv) the Swingline Obligation shall not exceed the Swingline Sublimit; and provided , further , that the Borrower Parties shall not: (A) use the proceeds of any Swingline Loan to refinance any outstanding Swingline Loan; or (B) except with the approval of the Swingline Lender, request more than two (2) Swingline Loans during any given week. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower Parties may borrow under this Section 2.07 , prepay under Section 3.05 , and re-borrow under this Section 2.07 . Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest payable in arrears on the outstanding principal amount thereof, from the applicable Borrowing date thereof to the date of payment of such Swingline Loan, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans and shall only be made in Dollars. Immediately upon the making of a Swingline Loan, each Committed Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swingline Lender a risk participation in such Swingline Loan in an amount equal to such Committed Lender s Applicable Percentage of the principal amount of such Swingline Loan. 
 (b) Borrowing Procedures . Each Borrowing under the Swingline shall be made upon the applicable Borrower Party s irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. on the requested Borrowing date, and shall: (i) specify the amount to be borrowed, which shall be in a principal amount that is not less than 1,000,000; (ii) specify the requested Borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day; and (iii) simultaneously request a Borrowing of a Base Rate Loan (which shall automatically convert to a Term SOFR Loan with a one (1) month Interest Period three (3) days thereafter but without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.03 under Section 2.02 to repay such Swingline Loan. Each such notice must be made by delivery to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice for such Swingline Loan and an applicable Syndicated Loan (to refinance such Swingline Loan), appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of such Borrower Party. Promptly after receipt by the Administrative Agent of any Loan Notice for a Swingline Loan, Administrative Agent shall notify the Swingline Lender of the amount of the applicable Swingline Loan. Unless the Swingline Lender has received notice from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 12:00 noon on the date of the proposed Swingline Borrowing: (A) directing the Swingline Lender not to make such Swingline Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.07(a) ; or (B) that one (1) or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 7 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender will, not later than 4:00 p.m. on the Borrowing date specified in such Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swingline Loan available to the Administrative Agent s Office for the account of the applicable Borrower Party at its office in Same Day Funds, and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth herein, Administrative Agent shall promptly deposit such proceeds in Same Day Funds in such Borrower Party s account specified in the Loan Notice, or, if requested by such Borrower Party in the Loan Notice, shall wire transfer such funds as requested.

(c) Refinancing of Swingline Loans . 

(i) To the extent a Loan Notice for a Syndicated Loan is not simultaneously 

48 

delivered with a Loan Notice for a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the applicable Borrower Party (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender Group make a Syndicated Loan in an amount equal to such Lender Group s Applicable Percentage of the amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02 , but without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.03 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans (to be automatically converted to a Term SOFR Loan with a one (1) month Interest Period three (3) days thereafter), but subject to the unutilized portion of the Available Commitment and the applicable conditions set forth in Section 7 . Promptly upon receipt of such Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Funding Agent by 1:00 p.m. at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date specified in such Loan Notice, specifying in such Loan Notice such Lender Group s Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans, and the Swingline Lender shall furnish the applicable Borrower Party with a copy of the applicable Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each (A) Conduit Lender may, and if a Conduit Lender does not, each Committed Lender in such Conduit Lender s Lender Group shall, and (B) each Committed Lender in a Lender Group without a Conduit Lender shall, upon receipt of such Loan Notice, make an amount equal to its Lender Group s Applicable Percentage (or, in the case of a Committed Lender, its Applicable Percentage) of the amount specified in such Loan Notice available (including for this purpose Cash Collateral and other credit support made available with respect to the applicable Swingline Loan) to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds for the account of the Swingline Lender not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.07(c)(ii) , each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the applicable Borrower Party in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender. 

(ii) If for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Base Rate Loan in accordance with Section 2.07(c)(i) , the request for Syndicated Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender that each of the Lender Groups fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan with a Base Rate Loan and each Lender Group s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.07(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. 

(iii) If any Lender Group fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender Group pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.07(c) by the time specified in Section 2.07(c)(i) , the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from the Committed Lenders in such Lender Group (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Swingline Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation; provided , however , that if such Lender Group fails to pay its 

49 

amount upon Administrative Agent s demand, then: (A) promptly on demand, to the extent such funds are available in the applicable Collateral Account for such purpose; and (B) otherwise, to the extent that it is necessary for Borrower to issue Capital Call Notices to fund such required payment, within fifteen (15) Business Days after Administrative Agent s demand, Borrower shall issue such Capital Call Notices and shall make such payment promptly after the related Capital Contributions are received. A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Committed Lender (through the Administrative Agent and the applicable Funding Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (iv) Each Committed Lender s obligation to make Syndicated Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans on behalf of its Lender Group pursuant to this Section 2.07(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including: (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Committed Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, any Borrower Party or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default; or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided , however , that each Committed Lender s obligation to make Syndicated Loans pursuant to this Section 2.07(c) is subject to the applicable conditions set forth in Section 7 . No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower Party to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 

(d) Repayment of Participations . 

(i) At any time after any Lender Group has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if Administrative Agent receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender Group its share of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender Group s risk participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by Administrative Agent. 

(ii) If any payment received by Administrative Agent in respect of principal or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to be returned by Administrative Agent under any of the circumstances described in Section 13.04 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in its discretion), each Committed Lender on behalf of its Lender Group shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swingline Lender. The obligations of the Lender Groups and the Committed Lenders under this clause (ii) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligation and the termination of this Credit Agreement. 

(e) Interest for Account of Swingline Lender . The Administrative Agent shall be responsible for invoicing the applicable Borrower Party for interest on the Swingline Loans. Until each Lender Group funds its Syndicated Loans or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.07 to refinance such Lender Group s share of any Swingline Loan, interest in respect 

50 

of such share shall be solely for the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender. 
 (f) Payments Directly to Swingline Lender . The applicable Borrower Party shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swingline Loans directly to the Swingline Lender.

In such event, the applicable Borrower Party shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum amount specified in Section 2.03 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Available Commitment and the applicable conditions set forth in Section 7 (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice).

In such event, each Committed Lender s payment to Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer pursuant to Section 2.08(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Committed Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.08 . 

(iv) Until each Committed Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.08(c) to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Committed Lender s

Repayment Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer. 
 (v) Each Committed Lender s obligation to make Base Rate Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.08(c) , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including: (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Committed Lender may have against the Letter of Credit Issuer, any Borrower Party, or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of Default; or

No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of any Borrower Party to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
 (vi) If any Committed Lender fails to make available to Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Committed Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.08(c) by the time specified in Section 2.08(c)(ii) , then, without limiting the other provisions of this Credit Agreement, the Letter of Credit Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Committed Lender (acting through Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Letter of Credit Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the Letter of Credit Issuer submitted to any Committed Lender (through Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(ii) If any payment received by Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer pursuant to Section 2.08(d)(i) is required to be returned under any 

56 

of the circumstances described in Section 13.04 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Letter of Credit Issuer in its discretion), each Committed Lender shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer its share thereof on demand of Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Committed Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.

 (d) to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Letter of Credit Issuer or 
 Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Credit Agreement; (e) so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Credit Agreement; and 
 (f) to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if: (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share; and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 7.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Syndicated Loans of, and Letter of Credit Liability owed to, all Lender Groups of Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Repayment Percentage (without giving effect to the Principal Obligation of such Defaulting Lender) prior to being applied to the payment of any Syndicated Loans of, or Letter of Credit Liability owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Syndicated Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letter of Credit Liability and Swingline Loans are held by the Committed Lenders in accordance with each such Committed Lender s Repayment Percentage (without giving effect to the Principal Obligation held by such Defaulting Lender) without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv) . Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
 (iii) Certain Fees . 

(A) A Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any unused commitment fee payable under Section 2.11 for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and Borrower shall not be required to pay any 

63 

such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to such Defaulting Lender). 
 (B) Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Repayment Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.14 .

(iv) Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure . All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in Letter of Credit Liability and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among each Non-Defaulting Lender (based on its Committed Lender Percentage (without giving effect to the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender)) calculated as the product of its Lender Group s Lender Group Percentage (without giving effect to the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender) multiplied by the principal amount of such participation, but only to the extent that: 

(x) the conditions set forth in Section 7.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless Borrower shall have otherwise notified Administrative Agent at such time, Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time); and (y) such reallocation does not cause (i) the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure and Letter of Credit Liability of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s Commitment or (ii) the Revolving Credit Exposure and Letter of Credit Liability of any Lender Group to exceed the aggregate Commitments of its Non-Defaulting Lenders. Subject to Section 13.28 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Committed Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
 (v) Cash Collateral . If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lender s Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the Letter of Credit Issuer s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.14 . 

(b) Defaulting Lender Cure . If Borrower, Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and the Letter of Credit Issuer agree in writing that a Committed Lender is no longer a Defaulting

 2.16 Extension of Stated Maturity Date . So long as no (x) Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the Stated Maturity Date and (y) the representations and warranties contained in Section 8 or in any other Loan Document shall be true and correct in all material respects on, and as of, the Stated Maturity Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.16 , the representations and warranties contained in Section 8.06 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent financial statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) , respectively, of Section 9.01 , Borrower may extend the Stated Maturity Date to a Business Day that is not later than three (3) months after the then-effective Stated Maturity Date, no more than two (2) times, upon (the date such conditions are satisfied, the Facility Extension Effective Date ): (a) delivery of a Facility Extension Request to Administrative Agent not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the Stated Maturity Date then in effect; (b) payment to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders of a facility extension fee as set forth in a separate fee letter agreement; and (c) consent of Administrative Agent and all Lenders of such extension, in their sole discretion.

 6. Borrower shall have delivered to Administrative Agent the Facility Increase Request (and Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver copies of such notice to Funding Agents);

reasonably require to establish the identities of and verify the authority and capacity of each Responsible Officer thereof authorized to act as a Responsible Officer in connection with the requested increase, this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Borrower Party is a party; and (B) a favorable opinion of counsel to the Borrower Parties, covering such matters relating to the requested increase and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and the Borrower Parties hereby request that such counsel deliver such opinion; provided, however , Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, waive or deem satisfied any of the foregoing conditions in this Section 2.17(a)(iii) at any time and from time to time; 
 9. After giving effect to the increase in the Committed Lender s Commitment, the Maximum Commitment will not exceed the Maximum Accordion Amount;

11. No Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result from such increase in the Committed Lenders Commitments; 

12. As of the date of such increase, the representations and warranties contained in Section 8 shall be true and correct in all material respects, with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date; except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to any earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date and except that for the purposes of this Section 2.17(a)(vii) , the representations and warranties contained in Section 8.06 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent financial statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) , respectively, of Section 9.01 ;

3. PAYMENT OF OBLIGATIONS . 

3.01 Notes . 

(a) The Borrowings funded by each Lender shall be evidenced by one (1) or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender (or its Funding Agent) and by Administrative Agent in the Register in the ordinary course of business. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of such Borrower Party hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender (or its Funding Agent, if applicable) and the accounts and records of Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 

(b) Any Funding Agent, on behalf of any Lender member of its Lender Group, may request that the Syndicated Loans to be made by such Lender Group to the Borrower shall be evidenced by promissory notes. Swingline Loans and Qualified Borrower obligations shall not be evidenced by separate promissory notes. If so requested, the Borrower shall issue such Notes. Each such Note shall: (a) be payable to the Funding Agent for such Lender Group or such other administrator or trustee for the Lender member of such Lender Group as such Funding Agent may designate (or, if requested by such Funding Agent, to such Funding Agent and its registered assigns); (b) bear interest in accordance with the provisions hereof; (c) be in the form of Exhibit B , attached hereto (with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith); and 

(d) be made by the Borrower. The Borrower agrees, from time to time, upon the request of Administrative Agent or any applicable Funding Agent, to reissue new Notes, in accordance with the terms and in the form heretofore provided, to any Committed Lender or Conduit Lender and to any Assignee of such Lender in accordance with Section 13.12 , in substitution for the Notes previously issued by the Borrower to the Funding Agent or other party, as appropriate and in accordance herewith for the affected Lender, and such previously issued Notes shall be returned to the Borrower marked cancelled . 
 3.02 Payment of Interest . 

(a) Interest . Interest on each Borrowing and any portion thereof shall commence to accrue in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents as of the date of the disbursal or wire transfer of such Borrowing by Administrative Agent, consistent with the provisions of Sections 2.06 and 2.13 , notwithstanding whether any Borrower Party received the benefit of such Borrowing as of such date and even if such Borrowing is held in escrow pursuant to the terms of any escrow arrangement or agreement. When a Borrowing is disbursed by wire transfer pursuant to instructions received from a Borrower Party, then such Borrowing shall be considered made at the time of the transmission of the wire, in accordance with the Loan Notice, rather than the time of receipt thereof by the receiving bank. With regard to the repayment of the Loans, interest shall continue to accrue on any amount repaid until such 

67 

time as the repayment has been received in federal or other Same Day Funds by Administrative Agent. 
 (b) Interest Payment Dates . Except with respect to Swingline Loans, which are addressed by Section 2.07(a) accrued and unpaid interest on the Obligations, including any interest payable on any Loan prepaid pursuant to Section 3.05 , shall be due and payable: (i) in arrears on each Interest Payment Date (for the fiscal quarter then ended with respect to Base Rate Loans, for the Interest Period then ended with respect to Term SOFR Loans and for all accrued and unpaid interest to date with respect to CP Rate Loans) and on the Maturity Date; (ii) on each other date of any reduction of the Principal Obligations hereunder (other than a voluntary prepayment pursuant to Section 3.05 ); and (iii) with respect to any obligation of a Borrower Party hereunder on which such Borrower Party is in default, at any time and from time to time following such default upon demand by Administrative Agent. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law. 

(c) Direct Disbursement . If, at any time, Administrative Agent or the Letter of Credit Issuer shall not have received on the date due, any payment of interest upon the Loans or any fee described herein, Administrative Agent may direct the disbursement of funds from the applicable Collateral Account to Lenders in accordance with the terms hereof, to the extent available therein for payment of any such amount. 

3.03 Payments of Obligations . 

(a) Maturity Date . The principal amount of the Obligations outstanding on the Maturity Date, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any other Obligations then outstanding, shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date. Each Borrower Party shall repay each Swingline Loan made to such Borrower Party on the earlier to occur of (i) the date three (3) Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made and (ii) the Maturity Date; provided , that, if an Event of Default shall occur, then all Swingline Loans shall immediately become due and payable. 

(b) Payments Generally . All payments of principal of, and interest on, the Obligations under this Credit Agreement by any Borrower Party to or for the account of Lenders, or any of them, shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff by such Borrower Party. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower Parties hereunder shall be made to Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders and Lender Groups to which such payment is owed, at Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Credit Agreement be made in the United States. Funds received by Administrative Agent after 1:00 p.m. shall be treated for all purposes as having been received by Administrative Agent on the first Business Day next following receipt of such funds and any applicable interest or fees shall continue to accrue. Except as provided in Section 13.11(c) hereof, and except for Swingline Loans repaid to the Swingline Lender before the provisions of Section 2.07(d)(i) become applicable, each Lender shall be entitled to receive its applicable share of each payment received by Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of Lenders on the Obligations. Each payment received by Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of a Lender shall be promptly distributed by Administrative Agent to the appropriate Funding Agent. If any payment to be made by any Borrower Party shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such 

68 

extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. Each Funding Agent agrees to use reasonable efforts to apply the amounts received in respect of such repayments to the outstanding Loans of the Lenders members of its Lender Group so as to minimize broken funding payments payable pursuant to Section 4.05 . 
 (c) Clawback . 

(i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Funding Agent prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans, Daily SOFR Loans or CP Rate Loan (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender Group will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender Group s share of such Borrowing, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender Group has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.04 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender Group has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.04 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower Party a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender Group has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to Administrative Agent, then the Committed Lenders in such Lender Group and the applicable Borrower Party severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower Party to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at: (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Committed Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing; and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by a Borrower Party, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans; provided , however , that if funds are not available to such Borrower Party in the Collateral Account to make payment on demand, to the extent that it is necessary for Borrower to issue Capital Call Notices to fund such required payment, such payment shall be made within fifteen (15) Business Days after Administrative Agent s demand (and, in any event, Borrower shall issue such Capital Call Notices and shall make such payment promptly after the related Capital Contributions are received). If any Borrower Party and such Committed Lender shall pay such interest to Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower Party the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower Party for such period. If such Committed Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Committed Lender s Syndicated Loan included in such Borrowing as of the date of such Borrowing. Any payment by a Borrower Party shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower Party may have against a Committed Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to Administrative Agent. 

(ii) Payments by Borrower Parties; Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower Party prior to the date on which any payment is due to Administrative Agent for the account of the Funding Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder that such Borrower Party will not make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower Party has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and 

69 

may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Funding Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Letter of Credit Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower Party has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Committed Lenders or the Letter of Credit Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Funding Agent s Lender Group or the Letter of Credit Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
 A notice of Administrative Agent to any Committed Lender or any Borrower Party with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 (d) General Order of Application . Each such repayment shall be applied to repay all outstanding Loans (other than any Swingline Loan) ratably or such Swingline Loan, as applicable. All payments made on the Obligations shall be credited, to the extent of the amount thereof, in the following order: (a) against all costs, expenses and other fees (including Attorney Costs) arising under the terms hereof; (b) against the amount of interest accrued and unpaid on the Obligations as of the date of such payment; (c) against all principal due and owing on the Obligations as of the date of such payment; and (d) to all other amounts constituting any portion of the Obligations. 

3.04 Mandatory Prepayment . 

(a) Excess Loans Outstanding . If, on any day, the Principal Obligation exceeds the Available Commitment (including, without limitation, as a result of an Exclusion Event, the delivery of an Initial Notice or the application of any Aggregate Concentration Limit or Individual Concentration Limit (a Mandatory Prepayment Event )), then the applicable Borrower Party shall pay to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, an amount sufficient that, after giving effect to such prepayment and any Capital Calls to fund such prepayment, the Principal Obligation would no longer exceed the Available Commitment (except to the extent any Swingline Loan is outstanding and the applicable Borrower Party elects to pay all or any portion of such excess with respect to any Swingline Loan, in which case such payment shall be for the benefit of Swingline Lender) (such amount, Required Payment ), in Same Day Funds: (a) promptly on demand (but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after such demand), to the extent such funds are available in the Collateral Account; and 

(b) within fifteen (15) Business Days of demand to the extent that it is necessary for Borrower to issue Capital Call Notices to fund such Required Payment (and Borrower shall issue such Capital Call Notices during such time and shall pay such Required Payment promptly after the Capital Contributions relating to such Capital Call Notice are received), together with all funds then on deposit in the Collateral Account equal the Required Payment to be paid pursuant to this Section 3.04(a) . 

(b) Excess Letters of Credit Outstanding . To the extent that any excess calculated pursuant to Section 3.04(a) is attributable to undrawn Letters of Credit, then the applicable Borrower Party may Cash Collateralize the Letter of Credit Liability in the amount of such excess, when required pursuant to the terms of Section 3.04(a) . To the extent that the Letter of Credit Liability exceeds the Available Commitment, the applicable Borrower Parties shall Cash Collateralize such Letter of Credit Liability in an amount equal to the excess of the Letter of Credit Liability over the Available Commitment. Unless otherwise required by law, upon: (A) a 

70 

change in circumstances such that such amount no longer remains outstanding; or (B) the full and final payment of the Obligations, Administrative Agent shall return to the applicable Borrower Party any remaining Cash Collateral as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event within two (2) Business Days. 
 (c) Reorganization . On the effective date of a Reorganization, the Borrower shall prepay the Obligations in full and the Commitments shall simultaneously terminate, and no Reorganization shall be effective until the Obligations are paid in full. 

(d) Approval of Vote . Prior to any proposed Vote, the Borrower shall provide such proposed Vote (together with other reasonably requested information related thereto) to Administrative Agent and all Lenders for approval in their sole discretion (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of the determination within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of all documentation applicable to such Vote. If Administrative Agent and all Lenders do not consent to such proposed Vote upon receipt of all documentation applicable to such Vote (such non-consent, the Vote Proposal Event ), the Maturity Date shall occur thirty (30) days prior to the distribution of such Vote to the Investors, and the Borrower shall prepay the Obligations in full and the Commitments shall simultaneously terminate; provided that if Administrative Agent and all Lenders do not consent to such proposed Vote and, prior to the occurrence of the Maturity Date in accordance with this clause (d) , the Borrower provides written notice to Administrative Agent that such proposed Vote has been retracted and formal documentation of such Vote will not be presented or circulated to the Investors, the Maturity Date shall not occur as a result of the Vote Proposal Event. 

3.05 Voluntary Prepayments . Any Borrower Party may, upon delivery of a Prepayment Notice to Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that: (a) with respect to Swingline Loans, the principal of any Swingline Loan may be prepaid by 11:00 a.m. on any Business Day, and any prepayment not received by 11:00 a.m. on such Business Day shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day; (b) with respect to any other Loan, such Prepayment Notice must be received by Administrative Agent not later than: (A) 11:00 a.m. three (3) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Term SOFR Loans, Daily SOFR Loans or CP Rate Loans; and (B) 11:00 a.m. one (1) Business Day prior to any date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; and (c) any prepayment of Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of 1,000,000 or a whole multiple of 100,000 in excess thereof; or, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such Prepayment Notice shall specify the date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of such prepayment, if applicable, the Type(s) of Syndicated Loans to be prepaid. Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Funding Agent of its receipt of each such Prepayment Notice, and of the amount of its Lender Group s Repayment Percentage of such prepayment. If such Prepayment Notice is given by a Borrower Party, such Borrower Party shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such Prepayment Notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. With respect to any Loan prepaid pursuant to this Section 3.05 , all accrued interest thereon shall be paid in accordance with Section 3.02(b) and any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 4 with respect thereto shall be promptly paid following receipt of an accurate and correct invoice for such amounts. Subject to Section 2.15 , each such prepayment shall be applied to the Principal Obligation held by each Lender in accordance with its applicable Repayment Percentage. 

3.06 Reduction or Early Termination of Commitments . Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the aggregate Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. three (3) Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, 

(ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of 5,000,000 or any whole multiple of 
 71 

1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Maximum Commitment hereunder shall at no time equal an aggregate amount of less than 25,000,000, (iv) Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Principal Obligation would exceed the Available Commitments; and (v) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the aggregate Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit exceeds the amount of the aggregate Commitments, such Letter of Credit Sublimit or Swingline Sublimit, as applicable, shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Committed Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the aggregate Commitments. Any reduction of the aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Committed Lender according to its pro rata share thereof. All fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. 
 3.07 Lending Office . Each Lender may: (a) designate the principal office or a branch, subsidiary or Affiliate of such Lender as its Lending Office (and the office to whose accounts payments are to be credited) for any Term SOFR Loan or Daily SOFR Loan; (b) designate its principal office or a branch, subsidiary or Affiliate as its Lending Office (and the office to whose accounts payments are to be credited) for any Base Rate Loan; and (c) change its Lending Office from time to time by notice to Administrative Agent and Borrower; provided that, in each case such designation does not impose any obligation to pay or withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes. In such event, the Funding Agent for such Lender shall continue to hold the Note, if any, evidencing its Loans for the benefit and account of such branch, subsidiary or Affiliate.

 75 

(5) Executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit the Borrower Parties or Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.

(D) if a payment made to a Recipient under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Recipient were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Recipient shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Borrower and Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Recipient has complied with such Recipient s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

76 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection , in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to a Borrower Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower Parties or any other Person.

4.02 Illegality . 

(a) If any Funding Party determines in its reasonable judgment that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Funding Party or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to Daily Simple SOFR or the Term SOFR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon Daily Simple SOFR or the Term SOFR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Funding Party to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the applicable interbank market, on notice thereof by such Funding Party to Borrower through its Funding Agent or the Administrative Agent: (i) any obligation of such Funding Party to make or continue Loans accruing interest at Daily Simple SOFR or the Term SOFR Rate or to convert any portion of Loans accruing interest at the Base Rate to a portion of Loans accruing interest at Daily Simple SOFR or the Term SOFR Rate will be suspended; and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Funding Party making or maintaining Base Rate Loans for which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Term SOFR Rate, the interest rate for Base Rate Loans made by such Funding Party shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Funding Party notifies its Funding Agent (which promptly notifies Administrative Agent and Borrower) that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist (which it agrees to do promptly upon becoming aware that such conditions cease to exist). Upon receipt of such notice: (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Funding Party (with a copy to Administrative Agent), convert Daily SOFR Loans and Term SOFR Loans to Base Rate Loans (with an interest rate that will, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR Rate), either, with respect to Term SOFR Loans, on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Funding Party may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans to such day, or, for Daily SOFR Loans or if such Funding Party may not lawfully continue to maintain Term SOFR Loans, immediately; and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Funding Party determining or charging interest rates based upon the Term SOFR Rate, Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension, compute the Base Rate applicable to such Funding Party without reference to the Term SOFR Rate until Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Funding Party that it is no longer illegal for such Funding Party to determine or charge interest rates based upon the 

77 

Term SOFR Rate. Upon any such conversion, each Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted. Each Funding Party agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Funding Party, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Funding Party. 
 (b) In the event that any Borrower Party, Lender or Administrative Agent obtains knowledge that a Borrower Party directly or indirectly or acting through or in concert with one (1) or more persons owns, controls, or has the power to vote more than 10 of any class of voting securities (within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 375b and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board or any regulation promulgated pursuant thereto) of any Lender, of a Bank Holding Company of which any Lender is a Subsidiary, and such circumstance causes the applicable Lender to be in violation of Regulation O, Borrower, Administrative Agent and such Lender shall cooperate in good faith to find a solution or remedy that would permit the applicable Lender to be in compliance with Regulation O, including, if necessary, such Lender assigning its Commitment to a new Lender in accordance with Section 13.11(b) hereof (provided that, such Lender shall not be required to accept less than the full amount of the Obligations due and owing to such Lender on the date of such assignment). 

4.03 Inability to Determine Rates; Market Disruption; Benchmark Replacement Setting . 

(a) Inability to Determine Rates. With respect to any Daily SOFR Loan or Term SOFR Loan, subject to Section 4.03(b) below, if: 

(i) Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that: 

(A) Daily Simple SOFR or the Term SOFR Rate cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof; or 

(B) the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for such Loan or a conversion thereto or continuation thereof, that Daily Simple SOFR or the Term SOFR Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loan, and the Required Lenders have provided notice of such determination to Administrative Agent; 

(ii) then, in each case, Administrative Agent will promptly so notify Borrower and each applicable Lender. Upon notice thereof by Administrative Agent to Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make Daily SOFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, and any right of Borrower to convert any Loan to a Daily SOFR Loan or Term SOFR Loan, as applicable, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Loans and/or Interest Periods) until Administrative Agent (with respect to clause (B) above, at the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (I) Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of or conversion to Daily SOFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (II) any outstanding affected Daily SOFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans, to the extent affected, will be converted into Base Rate Loans immediately, or with respect to Term SOFR Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Upon any such conversion, Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the 

78 

amount so prepaid or converted together with any additional amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 4.05 . Subject to Section 4.03(b) , if Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Term SOFR Rate cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any given day, the interest rate on Base Rate Loans shall be determined by Administrative Agent without reference to clause (iii) of the definition of Base Rate until Administrative Agent revokes such determination. 
 (b) Benchmark Replacement Setting . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, Administrative Agent and Borrower may amend this Credit Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected Lenders and Borrower so long as Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 4.03(b) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date. 

(c) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes . In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time (in consultation with Borrower) and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document. 

(d) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations . Administrative Agent will promptly notify Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of Benchmark Transition Event, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (iii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement.

Any determination, decision or election that may be made by Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 4.03 , including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 4.03 . 

(e) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the administrator of such Benchmark or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative or in compliance with or aligned with the International 

79 

Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks, then Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable, non-representative, non-compliant or non-aligned tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative or in compliance with or aligned with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 
 (f) Benchmark Unavailability Period . Upon Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Daily SOFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans calculated without reference to clause (iii) of the definition of Base Rate until Administrative Agent revokes such determination. 

4.04 Increased Costs Generally . 

(a) Change in Law . If any Change in Law shall: 

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Funding Party; 

(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than: (A) Indemnified Taxes; 

(B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (e) of the definition of Excluded Taxes; and 

(C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 

(iii) impose on any Funding Party or the applicable interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Credit Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or made or funded by a Liquidity Provider under a Liquidity Agreement or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Funding Party of making, converting, continuing, funding, or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make or fund any such Loan or to advance funds under a Liquidity Agreement), or to increase the cost to such Funding Party of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Funding Party (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Funding Party (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a certificate provided under subsection (c) of this Section 4.04 ), the applicable Borrower Party will pay to such Funding Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Funding Party for such additional costs incurred or reduction 
 80 

suffered; provided , however , that if funds are not available to such Borrower Party in the Collateral Account, to the extent that it is necessary for Borrower to issue Capital Call Notices to fund such required compensation, such payment shall be made within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of a certificate provided under subsection (c) of this Section 4.04 . 
 (b) Capital Requirements . If any Funding Party determines that any Change in Law affecting such Funding Party, any Lending Office of such Funding Party or such Funding Party s holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements or liquidity has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Funding Party s capital or on the capital of such Funding Party s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Credit Agreement, the Commitments of such Funding Party or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Funding Party, the Letters of Credit issued by the Letter of Credit Issuer or any obligation to advance funds under a Liquidity Agreement, to a level below that which such Funding Party or such Funding Party s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Funding Party s policies and the policies of such Funding Party s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and such Funding Party s desired return on capital), then from time to time the applicable Borrower Party will pay to such Funding Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Funding Party or such Funding Party s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 

(c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Funding Party setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Funding Party or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 4.04 and delivered to a Borrower Party shall be conclusive absent manifest error. In determining such amount, such Funding Party may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. 

(d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Funding Party to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Funding Party s right to demand such compensation, provided that no Borrower Party shall be required to compensate a Funding Party pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.04 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Funding Party notifies Borrower Parties of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Funding Party s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine (9) month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 

4.05 Compensation for Losses . Upon demand of any Funding Party (with a copy to Administrative Agent) from time to time, each applicable Borrower Party shall promptly compensate such Funding Party, as applicable, for and hold such Funding Party harmless from any loss, cost or expense (but excluding loss of anticipated profits) as reasonably determined by the applicable Funding Agent actually incurred by it as a result of: 

(a) any continuation, conversion (except as provided in Section 4.03(a)(ii) ), payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or Daily SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 

(b) any failure by such Borrower Party (for a reason other than the failure of such Funding Party to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan, in accordance 

81 

with the terms of this Credit Agreement, other than a Base Rate Loan or Daily SOFR Loan, on the date or in the amount notified by such Borrower Party ((including, in the case of any Conduit Lender, pursuant to a Liquidity Agreement) by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of funds acquired by such Lender (or the applicable Liquidity Provider(s)) (including funds obtained by issuing commercial paper or promissory notes or obtaining deposits or loans from third parties) in order to fund such Borrowing, continuation or conversion); or 
 (c) any assignment of a Term SOFR Loan or a CP Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by such Borrower Party pursuant to Section 13.13 ; 

including any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense (but excluding any loss of anticipated profits) arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. Each applicable Borrower Party shall also pay the customary administrative fees charged by such Lender or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, in connection with the foregoing. 
 In the case of a CP Rate Loan, the actual out-of-pocket loss to any Conduit Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Conduit Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such CP Rate Loan from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan, if the interest rate payable on such amount were calculated by reference to the CP Rate for such Interest Period, over (ii) the sum of (x) to the extent all or a portion of such principal amount remains outstanding hereunder, the amount of interest actually accrued during the remainder of such Interest Period on such principal amount, and (y) to the extent such principal amount does not remain outstanding hereunder, the income, if any, actually received during the remainder of such period by the Conduit Lender from investing such portion of such principal amount. 
 With respect to any Lender that is not a bank, the foregoing calculation shall be made using the rates that would be applicable to the applicable Funding Agent as a proxy for such Lender. A certificate of a Funding Party setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Funding Party or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in this Section 4.05 and delivered to a Borrower Party shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 4.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Funding Party . 

(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office .

 (b) In the event that Administrative Agent elects to notify the Investors to make Capital Contributions in respect of their Unfunded Commitments, then Administrative Agent shall not request any individual Investor to fund an amount exceeding such Investor s pro-rata share of the Obligations (based on the proportion of such Investor s Unfunded Commitment to the aggregate Unfunded Commitments of all Investors other than Defaulting Investors) without first making best efforts (consistent with the terms of the Constituent Documents and applicable Law) to issue a Capital Call (which may be issued by Borrower or Administrative Agent) to each Investor for its pro-rata share of the Obligations and waiting fifteen (15) Business Days following such Capital Call prior to initiating further remedies.

 11.04 Performance by Administrative Agent . Should any Borrower Party fail to perform any covenant, duty, or agreement contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, and such failure continues beyond any applicable cure period, Administrative Agent may (subject to Section 10.03 ), but shall not be obligated to, perform or attempt to perform such covenant, duty, or agreement on behalf of such Person. In such event, each Borrower Party shall, at the request of Administrative Agent promptly pay any reasonable amount expended by Administrative Agent in such performance or attempted performance to Administrative Agent at Administrative Agent s Office, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date of such expenditure until paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood that neither any of the Agents nor any of the other Secured Parties assume any liability or responsibility for the performance of any duties of any Borrower Party, or any related Person hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents or other control over the management and affairs of any Borrower Party, or any related Person, nor by any such action shall any of the Agents or other Secured Parties be deemed to create a partnership arrangement with any Borrower Party or any related Person.

(b) cause the Committed Lenders in such Funding Agent s Lender Group to purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Syndicated Loans and subparticipations in 

123 

the Letter of Credit Liability and Swingline Loans of the other Lender Groups, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lender Groups ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Syndicated Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that: 
 (i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 

(ii) the provisions of this Section 13.03 shall not be construed to apply to:

 Each Borrower Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Committed Lender or any Lender Group acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Committed Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower Party in the amount of such participation. 
 13.04 Payments Set Aside .

No failure by any Lender, the Letter of Credit Issuer, Swingline Lender or Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Borrower Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at Law in 
 124 

connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 11.02 for the benefit of all Lenders, Swingline Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer; provided , however , that the foregoing shall not prohibit: (a) Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; (b) the Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; (c) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 13.02 (subject to the terms of Section 11.03 and Section 13.03 ); or (d) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Borrower Party under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided , further , that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; then: (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.02 ; and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b) , (c) and (d) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 13.03 , any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders.

Successors and Assigns . 

Successors and Assigns Generally . The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Borrower Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except: (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of clauses (b) and (i) of this Section 13.11 and Section 13.12 ; (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of clause (f) of this Section 13.11 ; or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment or grant of a security interest subject to the restrictions of clause (g) of this Section 13.11 (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).

Assignments by Lenders . Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees (each, an Assignee all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this clause (b) , participations in Letter of Credit Liability) at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 

Minimum Amounts . 

In the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Committed Lender s Commitment and/or the Syndicated Loans at the time owing to it, contemporaneous assignments to related Approved Funds that equal at least the amount specified in clause 13.11(b)(i)(B) of this Section 

130 

13.11 in the aggregate, or, in the case of an assignment to a Committed Lender, an Affiliate of a Committed Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
 in any case not described in subclause (A) above, the aggregate amount of the Commitments (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitments are not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption Agreement with respect to such assignment is delivered to Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than 5,000,000, unless each of Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower, otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Assignee (or to an Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met. 

Proportionate Amounts . Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned. 

Required Consents . No consent shall be required for any assignment except: (A) as provided in the definition of Eligible Assignee (B) the consent of each Letter of Credit Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) shall be required for any assignment (other than to a Liquidity Provider) that increases the obligation of the Assignee to participate in exposure under one or more Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding); and (C) the consent of the Swingline Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) shall be required for any assignment (other than to a Liquidity Provider) that increases the obligation of the Assignee to participate in exposure under a Swingline Loan (whether or not then outstanding). For the avoidance of doubt, no consent shall be required for any assignment from a Conduit Lender to a Conduit Assignee or a Liquidity Provider. 

Assignment and Assumption Agreement . Other than an assignment by a Conduit Lender to a Conduit Assignee or a Liquidity Provider, the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of 

3,500 (except in the case of a transfer at the demand of Borrower under Section 13.13 , in which case either Borrower or the transferee Lender shall pay such fee); provided , however , that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire. 
 No Assignment to Certain Persons . No such assignment shall be made: 

(A) to a Borrower Party or any Affiliate or Subsidiary of any Borrower Party; (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B) ; (C) to a natural person; (D) to any Person that is not a Qualified Purchaser; 
 131 

(E) to any Person that is not an Eligible Assignee; or (F) to any Sanctioned Lender (or any Person that would, upon becoming a Lender, be a Sanctioned Lender). 
 Borrower Requested Assignments . Each assignment made as a result of a demand by Borrower under Section 13.13 shall be arranged by Borrower after consultation with Administrative Agent and shall be either an assignment of all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Credit Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently with another assignment or assignments that together constitute an assignment of all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender. 

Certain Additional Payments . In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to such assignment shall make such additional payments to Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of Borrower and Administrative Agent, the applicable share of Syndicated Loans previously requested but not funded by such Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to: (A) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer, Swingline Lender or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and 

(B) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its applicable share of all Syndicated Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph , then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Credit Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
 Lender Group Joinder Agreement . Upon the Borrower s request, with the consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, an additional Lender Group may be added to this Credit Agreement at any time by the execution and delivery of a Lender Group Joinder Agreement by the members of such proposed additional Lender Group, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and, if applicable, the Lenders, which execution and delivery shall not be unreasonably refused by such parties. Upon receipt of (i) an executed Lender Group Joinder Agreement and (ii) a completed administrative questionnaire with respect to each member of such additional Lender Group, (A) each Person specified therein as a Conduit Lender shall become a party hereto as a Conduit Lender, entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Conduit Lender hereunder, (B) each Person specified therein as a Committed Lender shall become a party hereto as a Committed Lender, entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Committed Lender hereunder, (C) each Person specified therein as a Funding Agent shall become a party hereto as a Funding Agent, entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Funding Agent hereunder, (D) the Administrative Agent shall accept such Lender Group Joinder Agreement and record the information contained therein in the Register, (E) subject to Section 2.17(a) , the Maximum Commitment shall be increased by an amount equal to the aggregate Commitments of the Committed Lenders party to such Lender Group Joinder Agreement and (F) Schedule 1.01A shall be deemed to be amended and 

132 

supplemented to reflect such joinder. The Administrative Agent shall give each Funding Agent prompt notice of the addition of any Lender Group. 
 Effect of Assignment . Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by Administrative Agent pursuant to clause (e) of this Section 13.11 , from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Credit Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Credit Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits and obligations of Sections 4.01 , 4.04 , 4.05 and 13.06 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided , that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, each applicable Borrower Party (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the Funding Agent of the Assignee, if applicable, and the applicable existing Note or Notes shall be returned to the Borrower, as applicable. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Credit Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Credit Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with clause (f) of this Section 13.11 . 

Register . Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower Parties (such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at Administrative Agent s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement and Lender Group Joinder Agreement delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Funding Agents, Lenders, and the Commitments of the Committed Lenders of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and Letter of Credit Liability owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each Borrower Party, Agents, the Swingline Lender and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Funding Agent or Lender hereunder, as the case may be, for all purposes of this Credit Agreement. In addition, Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation of any Committed Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower Parties, any Agent, the Swingline Lender and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Credit Agreement and for avoidance of doubt, each Lender Group with more than one Conduit Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, assign to another Conduit Lender in its Lender Group all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder (including the outstanding Obligations and rights to payment of Principal Obligation and interest), as determined by the Administrative Agent from time to time. Each such assignment shall be recorded on the books and records of the Administrative Agent and the relevant Conduit Lenders, without the need to execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement. For all purposes of this Credit Agreement and all related documents, with respect to each assignment under this paragraph the relevant Conduit Lender shall be deemed to have the benefit of, and be subject to the obligations imposed by, an executed, 
 133 

delivered, accepted and recorded Assignment and Acceptance Assignment relating to such assignment. 
 Participations . Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower Party, Funding Agent, Letter of Credit Issuer, Swingline Lender or Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person that is a Qualified Purchaser (other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender, a Disqualified Lender or a Borrower Party or any Affiliate or Subsidiary thereof) (each, a Participant in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and/or obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender s participations in Letter of Credit Liability and Swingline Loans) owing to it); provided that any Committed Lender may sell a participation in its rights and obligations hereunder only with the written consent of the Conduit Lender(s) in its Lender Group, and provided , further that: (i) such Lender s obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain unchanged; (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; and (iii) each Borrower Party, each Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Swingline Lenders and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 13.06(c) without regard to the existence of any participation. 

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the second proviso of Section 13.01 that directly affects such Participant. Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.01 , 4.04 , and 4.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 13.11 (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 4.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 13.11 ; provided that such Participant: (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 4.01 , 4.06 , 13.11 and 13.18 as if it were an assignee under clause (b) of this Section 13.11 ; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 4.01 or 4.05 with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 4.06 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 13.02 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 13.03 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register ); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries 
 134 

in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Credit Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
 Certain Pledges . Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment or grant of a security interest to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, central bank or a collateral trustee or security agent for holders of commercial paper without notice to, or consent from, any Borrower Party or the Administrative Agent; provided that no such pledge or assignment or grant of a security interest shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee or grantee for such Lender as a party hereto. 

Resignation as Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender after Assignment . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Natixis assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to Section 13.11(b) , Natixis may, upon thirty (30) days notice to Borrower and Lenders, resign as Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender. In the event of any such resignation as Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender, Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Committed Lenders (subject to the consent of such Committed Lender in its sole discretion) a successor Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender hereunder; provided , however , that no failure by Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Natixis as Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be. If Natixis resigns as Letter of Credit Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as Letter of Credit Issuer and all Letter of Credit Liability with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.08(c) ). If Natixis resigns as Swingline Lender, it shall retain all of the rights of the Swingline Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swingline Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require Committed Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.07(c) . Upon the appointment of a successor Letter of Credit Issuer and/or Swingline Lender: (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be; and (ii) the successor Letter of Credit Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to Natixis to effectively assume the obligations of Natixis with respect to such Letters of Credit. 

Certain Conduit Lender Provisions . Without limiting the foregoing, a Conduit Lender may, from time to time, with prior or concurrent notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in one transaction or a series of transactions, assign all or a portion of its interest in the Principal Obligation and its rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement and any other Loan Documents to which it is a party to a Conduit Assignee. Upon and to the extent of such assignment by the Conduit Lender to a Conduit Assignee, (i) such Conduit Assignee shall become a Conduit Lender in the assigning Conduit Lender s Lender Group, with the Committed Lender and the Funding Agent in such Lender Group being the Committed Lender and Funding Agent, respectively, for such Conduit Assignee, (ii) such Conduit Assignee (as Conduit Lender) shall be the owner of the assigned portion of the Principal Obligation, (iii) the 

135 

related administrator for such Conduit Assignee will act as the Administrator for such Conduit Assignee, with all corresponding rights and powers, express or implied, granted to an Administrator hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, (iv) such Conduit Assignee, any Related Commercial Paper Issuer, if such Conduit Assignee does not itself issue commercial paper, and their respective Liquidity Provider(s) and other Related Parties shall have the benefit of all the rights and protections provided to the Conduit Lender and its Liquidity Provider(s) herein and in the other Loan Documents (including any limitation on recourse against such Conduit Assignee or Related Parties, any agreement not to file or join in the filing of a petition to commence an insolvency proceeding against such Conduit Assignee, and the right to assign to another Conduit Assignee as provided in this paragraph ), (v) such Conduit Assignee shall assume all (or the assigned or assumed portion) of the Conduit Lender s obligations, if any, hereunder or any other Loan Document, and the Conduit Lender shall be released from such obligations, in each case to the extent of such assignment, and the obligations of the Conduit Lender and such Conduit Assignee shall be several and not joint, (vi) all distributions in respect of the Principal Obligation assigned shall be made to the applicable Funding Agent, on behalf of the Conduit Lender and such Conduit Assignee on a pro rata basis according to their respective interests, (vii) the definition of the term CP Rate with respect to the portion of the Principal Obligation funded with Commercial Paper issued by the Conduit Lender from time to time shall be determined in the manner set forth in the definition of CP Rate applicable to the Conduit Lender on the basis of the interest rate or discount applicable to Commercial Paper issued by such Conduit Assignee rather than the original Conduit Lender, (viii) the defined terms and other terms and provisions of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be interpreted in accordance with the foregoing, and (ix) if requested by the Funding Agent or Administrator with respect to the Conduit Assignee, the parties will execute and deliver such further agreements and documents and take such other actions as such Funding Agent or Administrator may reasonably request to evidence and give effect to the foregoing. No such assignment shall be made to a Conduit Assignee unless the Commercial Paper of such Conduit Assignee shall have short-term credit ratings of A-1 and P-1 without the consent of Borrower. No assignment by a Conduit Lender to a Conduit Assignee of all or any portion of its interest in the Principal Obligation shall in any way diminish the obligation of the Committed Lenders in such Conduit Lender s Lender Group under Section 2.02 to fund any Loan not funded by the Conduit Lender or such Conduit Assignee or to acquire from the Conduit Lender or such Conduit Assignee all or any portion of its interest in the Principal Obligation pursuant this Section 13.11(b)(i) .

(ii) if requested by such Conduit Lender, shall enter into such agreements as requested by such Conduit Lender pursuant to which they shall be obligated to provide funding to such Conduit Assignee on the same terms and conditions as is provided for in this Credit Agreement in respect of such Conduit Lender (or which agreements shall be otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and such Conduit Lender), and (iii) shall take such actions as the related Administrator shall reasonably request in connection therewith. 
 136 

Assignment to Committed Lenders . 

Assignment Amounts . At any time on or prior to the Stated Maturity Date, if the Administrator on behalf of the applicable Conduit Lender so elects, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and such Conduit Lender s Funding Agent, such Conduit Lender hereby assigns effective on the Assignment Date referred to below all or such portions as may be elected by such Conduit Lender of its interest in the Principal Obligation at such time to its Committed Lenders pursuant to this Section 13.12 ; provided , however , that unless such assignment is an assignment of all such Conduit Lender s interest in the Principal Obligation in whole on or after its Conduit Investment Termination Date, no such assignment shall take place pursuant to this Section 13.12 if an Event of Default shall then exist; and provided , further , that no such assignment shall take place pursuant to this Section 13.12 at a time when such Conduit Lender is subject to any proceedings under any Debtor Relief Laws. No further documentation or action on the part of such Conduit Lender, the Borrower, or the applicable Committed Lenders shall be required to exercise the rights set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, other than the giving of the notice by the related Administrator on behalf of such Conduit Lender referred to in such sentence and the delivery by such Conduit Lender s Funding Agent of a copy of such notice to each Committed Lender in the Lender Group (the date of the receipt by the Administrative Agent of any such notice being the Assignment Date ). Each Committed Lender hereby agrees, unconditionally and irrevocably and under all circumstances, without set-off, counterclaim or defense of any kind, to pay the full amount of its Assignment Amount on such Assignment Date to such Conduit Lender in Same Day Funds in Dollars based on the assigning Conduit Lender s interest in the Principal Obligation, to an account designated by such Conduit Lender s Funding Agent. Upon payment of its Assignment Amount, each such Committed Lender shall acquire an interest in the Principal Obligation equal to its Committed Lender Percentage thereof. Upon any assignment in whole by a Conduit Lender to its Committed Lenders on or after its Conduit Investment Termination Date as contemplated hereunder, such Conduit Lender shall cease to make any additional Loans hereunder. At all times prior to its Conduit Investment Termination Date, nothing herein shall prevent a Conduit Lender from making a subsequent Loan hereunder, in its sole discretion, following any assignment pursuant to this Section 13.12 or from making more than one assignment pursuant to this Section 13.12 . 

Additional Assignment Amounts .

If the applicable Borrower Party does not make payment of such amounts at or prior to the time of assignment by a Conduit Lender to its Committed Lenders, such amount shall be paid by such Committed Lenders to the Conduit Lender as additional consideration for the interests assigned to the Committed Lenders and, except to the extent the applicable Borrower Party makes payment of such amounts to the Committed Lender when due, the amount of the Loans hereunder held by such Committed Lenders shall be increased by an amount equal to the additional amount so paid by such Committed Lenders. 

Administration of Agreement after Assignment from Conduit Lender to Committed Lenders following the Conduit Investment Termination Date . After any assignment in whole by a Conduit Lender to its Committed Lenders pursuant to this 

137 

Section 13.12 at any time on or after its Conduit Investment Termination Date (and the payment of all amounts owing to such Conduit Lender in connection therewith), all rights of the related Administrator set forth herein shall be given to the applicable Funding Agent on behalf of its Committed Lenders instead of such Administrator.

Recovery of Loans . In the event that the aggregate of the Assignment Amounts paid by the Committed Lenders with respect to any Lender Group pursuant to this Section 13.12 on any Assignment Date occurring on or after the Conduit Investment Termination Date for the related Conduit Lender is less than the Loans of such Conduit Lender on such Assignment Date, then to the extent that payments or deposits thereafter received and applied by the Administrative Agent with respect to such Lender Group under Section 3.03 in respect of Loans exceed the aggregate of the unrecovered Assignment Amounts and Loans funded by such Committed Lenders, such excess shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to such Conduit Lender s Funding Agent for the benefit of such Conduit Lender. 

Replacement of Funding Party or Lender Group . If any Borrower Party is entitled to replace a Funding Party pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.06 (in any such case, an Affected Funding Party ), then Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort: 

by notice to the applicable Funding Party, and with the consent of the Administrative Agent and such Funding Party s Funding Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), elect to replace such Affected Funding Party as a Funding Party to this Credit Agreement with an Eligible Assignee procured by Borrower, provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, and provided , further that, concurrently with such replacement such Eligible Assignee shall agree to purchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to the Affected Funding Party pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement and to become a Funding Party for all purposes under this Credit Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Funding Party to be terminated as of such date. Any such Affected Funding Party shall assign its rights and interests hereunder (other than its existing rights to payment pursuant to Sections 4.01 and 4.04 ), such assignment to be effected in compliance with the requirements of Section 13.11 . In the event that such an assignment occurs, the Eligible Assignee: (i) if requested by the applicable Funding Agent, shall execute (either directly or through a participation agreement, as determined by the Funding Agent) a Liquidity Agreement related to the applicable Conduit Lender, to the extent of such assignment, the terms of which shall be substantially similar to those of the participation or other agreement by the assigning Committed Lender with respect to the applicable Liquidity Agreement (or which shall be otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Funding Agent); and (ii) shall take such actions as the Agents shall reasonably request in connection therewith. A Funding Party shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Funding Party or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply; and 

by notice to each member of the applicable Funding Party s Lender Group, and with the consent of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or 

138 

conditioned), elect to replace the Affected Funding Party s Lender Group with a Lender Group procured by Borrower, provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, and provided , further that, concurrently with such replacement the Lenders in such replacement Lender Group shall agree to purchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to each Lender in the Affected Funding Party s Lender Group pursuant to one or more Assignment and Assumption Agreements and to become a Funding Party for all purposes under this Credit Agreement and to assume all obligations of each Lender in the Affected Funding Party s Lender Group to be terminated as of such date. Each Lender in the Affected Funding Party s Lender Group shall assign its rights and interests hereunder, such assignment to be effected in compliance with the requirements of Section 13.11 . 
 Maximum Rate . Regardless of any provision contained in any of the Loan Documents, Funding Party shall never be entitled to receive, collect or apply as interest on the Obligations any amount in excess of the Maximum Rate, and, in the event that Funding Party ever receive, collect or apply as interest any such excess, the amount which would be excessive interest shall be deemed to be a partial prepayment of principal and treated hereunder as such; and, if the principal amount of the Obligations is paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be paid to the applicable Borrower Party. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable under any specific contingency exceeds the Maximum Rate, each Borrower Party and Funding Party shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law: (a) characterize any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest; (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof; and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate and spread, in equal parts, the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the Obligations so that the interest rate does not exceed the Maximum Rate; provided that , if the Obligations are paid and performed in full prior to the end of the full contemplated term thereof, and if the interest received for the actual period of existence thereof exceeds the Maximum Rate, each applicable Funding Party shall refund to the applicable Borrower Party the amount of such excess or credit the amount of such excess against the principal amount of the Obligations and, in such event, Funding Parties shall not be subject to any penalties provided by any laws for contracting for, charging, taking, reserving or receiving interest in excess of the Maximum Rate. As used herein, the term applicable law shall mean the law in effect as of the date hereof; provided , however , that in the event there is a change in the law which results in a higher permissible rate of interest, then the Loan Documents shall be governed by such new law as of its effective date. 

Headings . Section headings are for convenience of reference only and shall in no way affect the interpretation of this Credit Agreement.

Upon receipt of a Loan Notice from Administrative Agent, each Funding Agent shall request the Conduit Lender (if any) in its Lender Group to make the Syndicated Loan, and such Conduit Lender may from time to time during the Availability Period, in its sole discretion, agree or decline to make the Syndicated Loan. At no time will any Conduit Lender have any obligation to fund a Syndicated Loan or participate in any Letter of Credit or Swingline Loans. At all times on and after the Conduit Investment Termination Date for a Conduit Lender, or if Conduit Lender has failed for whatever reason to fund its portion of a Borrowing in full, all Loans shall be made by the Committed Lenders of such Conduit Lender s Lender Group. At any time when a Conduit Lender has rejected a request for Syndicated Loan (it being understood that if a Conduit Lender does not fund any Syndicated Loan in relation to which all of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 7.02 have been satisfied on the date set forth in the applicable Loan Notice, such Conduit Lender shall be deemed to have rejected the request for Syndicated Loan), such Conduit Lender s Funding Agent shall so notify the Committed Lenders in such Conduit Lender s Lender Group and such Committed Lenders shall make such Syndicated Loan in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.02(c) or elsewhere in this Credit Agreement to the contrary, no Committed Lender shall be obligated to provide Administrative Agent or any Borrower Party with funds in connection with a Syndicated Loan in an amount that would result in such Committed Lender s Principal Obligation exceeding its Commitment then in effect by any such Committed Lender as a Liquidity Provider under a Liquidity Agreement, and all Loans funded by a Conduit Lender shall be CP Rate Loans. 

(d) [Reserved] 

(e) Tranches . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Borrower Parties shall not have the right to have more than seven (7) Term SOFR Loans in the aggregate outstanding hereunder at any one (1) time during the Availability Period. 

(f) Continuations and Conversions of Term SOFR Loans and Automatic Continuation of CP Rate Loans . Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term SOFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Term SOFR Loan. Any CP Rate Loan shall automatically continue as a CP Rate Loan without any further action of any Borrower Party. 

2.03 Minimum Loan Amounts . Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Syndicated Loans shall be in a principal amount that is an integral multiple of 100,000 and not less than 

43 

1,000,000, and each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Daily SOFR Loans or Base Rate Loans, shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of 100,000 and not less than 500,000; provided , however , that a Daily SOFR Loan or Base Rate Loan may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments or in an aggregate amount that is required for the reimbursement of a Letter of Credit under Section 2.08(c) . 
 44 

2.04 Funding . 

(a) Funding by Committed Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Except with respect to Swingline Loans, which are addressed in Section 2.07 , each Conduit Lender and each Committed Lender, as the case may be, shall, in accordance with the terms hereof, on any Loan Date make the proceeds of its Applicable Percentage of each Borrowing available to Administrative Agent in Dollars at Administrative Agent s Office for the applicable currency for the account of the appropriate Borrower Party (or, if otherwise agreed between such Lender and such Borrower Party and upon fulfillment of all applicable conditions set forth herein, directly to such Borrower Party as specified in the Loan Notice, or, if requested by such Borrower Party in the Loan Notice, shall wire transfer such funds as requested) no later than 2:00 p.m. in the case of any Syndicated Loan denominated in Dollars on the Loan Date in Same Day Funds, and upon fulfillment of all applicable conditions set forth herein, Administrative Agent shall promptly deposit such proceeds in Same Day Funds in such Borrower Party s account at Administrative Agent specified in the Loan Notice, or, if requested by such Borrower Party in the Loan Notice, shall wire transfer such funds as requested; provided , however , that (i) if, in connection with a particular Credit Extension, the 2:00 p.m. time in this sentence is not met as a result of an operational or technical error, issue or oversight, then the 2:00 p.m. time in this sentence shall instead be 3:00 p.m. and (ii) if a single entity is the only Lender, such Lender may wire such funds directly to the Borrower Party (or as directed by the Borrower Party) as specified in the Loan Notice. The failure of any Committed Lender to advance the proceeds of its respective share of any Borrowing required to be advanced hereunder shall not relieve any other Committed Lender of its obligation to advance the proceeds of its Applicable Percentage of any Borrowing required to be advanced hereunder. Absent contrary written notice from a Funding Agent prior to the proposed Loan Date that a Conduit Lender or a Committed Lender in such Lender Group will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender s share, as applicable, of such Borrowing, Administrative Agent may assume that each Committed Lender and each Conduit Lender, as the case may be, has made its Applicable Percentage of the requested Borrowing available to Administrative Agent on the applicable Loan Date and in the applicable currency, and Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption (but is not required to), make available to the appropriate Borrower Party a corresponding amount. 

(b) Obligations of Committed Lenders Several . The obligations of the Committed Lenders hereunder to make Syndicated Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 13.06(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Committed Lender to make any Syndicated Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 13.06(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Committed Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Committed Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Committed Lender to so make its Syndicated Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 13.06(c) . 

(c) Commercial Paper . Each Conduit Lender confirms that, to the extent permitted by its commercial paper program documentation, it intends to fund all Loans hereunder through the issuance of its Commercial Paper at all times prior to the occurrence of a Liquidity Event, the termination date specified in its Liquidity Agreement, an Event of Default or certain other circumstances occurring in the financial or Commercial Paper markets in general or with respect to the Loan Documents, or any Borrower Party in particular which, in the opinion of such, Conduit Lender or its Funding Agent or Administrator, make funding the Loans through the issuance of Commercial Paper reasonably inadvisable. 

2.05 Interest . 

45 

(a) Interest Rate . Subject to the provisions of clause (b) below: 

(i) (A) each CP Rate Loan funded by a Conduit Lender through the issuance of Commercial Paper shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the CP Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for CP Rate Loans, and (B) each CP Rate Loan funded by a Conduit Lender through its Liquidity Provider shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Floating SOFR plus the Applicable Margin for CP Rate Loans, each in accordance with Section 2.02 , for each day in such Interest Period prior to the day on which such funding has been refinanced through the issuance of Commercial Paper and at the CP Rate for the remainder of such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for CP Rate Loans; 

(ii) each Term SOFR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for Term SOFR Loans, all in accordance with Section 2.02 ; and 

(iii) each Daily SOFR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Daily SOFR plus the Applicable Margin for Daily SOFR Loans in accordance with Section 2.02 ; 

(iv) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.02 . 

(b) Default Rate . 

(i) If any amount of principal of the Obligations is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), then (in lieu of the interest rate provided in Section 2.05(a) above) such amount shall bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate. 

(ii) If any amount (other than principal of the Obligations) payable by Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders (in lieu of the interest rate provided in Section 2.05(a) above), such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate. 

(iii) Upon the request of Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, then (in lieu of the interest rate provided in Section 2.05(a) above) the principal amount of the Obligations shall bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate, from the date of the occurrence of such Event of Default until such Event of Default is cured or is waived. 

2.06 Determination of Rate and Billing . Each change in the rate of interest for any Borrowing or any portion thereof shall become effective, without prior notice to the Borrower Parties, automatically as of the opening of business of Administrative Agent on the date of said change. Administrative Agent 

46 

shall promptly notify Borrower and the Committed Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Term SOFR Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of any SOFR Rate by Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The applicable CP Rate shall be determined for each Conduit Lender by the applicable Funding Agent and reported, together with a calculation of any accrued interest and fees for the applicable period (but excluding any fee payable pursuant to Section 2.11 payable to such Conduit Lender on any Interest Payment Date, to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by 11:00 a.m. five (5) Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date; provided that , if such Funding Agent fails to report the CP Rate to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by such time, the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to use the interest rate being paid to the non-Conduit Lenders for such applicable period for any such non-reporting Conduit Lender (provided that such amount paid to any non-reporting Conduit Lender shall be trued-up on the following applicable Interest Payment Date upon five (5) Business Days prior notice). The Administrative Agent will bill the Borrower on behalf of all Lenders with respect to interest on Syndicated Loans. 
 2.07 Swingline Loans . 

(a) The Swingline . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein during the Swingline Availability Period, the Swingline Lender agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Committed Lenders set forth in this Section 2.07 , on any Business Day during the Availability Period, to make loans (each such loan, a Swingline Loan in Dollars to the Borrower Parties at any time and from time to time in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swingline Sublimit; provided , however , that after giving effect to any Swingline Loan or purchase or funding any risk participations therein: (i) the Principal Obligation shall not exceed the Available Commitment; (ii) no Committed Lender s revolving credit exposure shall exceed such Committed Lender s Commitment (minus any amounts funded in respect of a Loan hereunder (but not used to fund such Loan and accordingly not included in the Principal Obligation) by any such Committed Lender as a Liquidity Provider under a Liquidity Agreement); (iii) the Principal Obligation of each Lender Group shall not exceed such Lender Group s Lender Group Limit;; and (iv) the Swingline Obligation shall not exceed the Swingline Sublimit; and provided , further , that the Borrower Parties shall not: (A) use the proceeds of any Swingline Loan to refinance any outstanding Swingline Loan; or (B) except with the approval of the Swingline Lender, request more than two (2) Swingline Loans during any given week. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower Parties may borrow under this Section 2.07 , prepay under Section 3.05 , and re-borrow under this Section 2.07 . Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest payable in arrears on the outstanding principal amount thereof, from the applicable Borrowing date thereof to the date of payment of such Swingline Loan, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans and shall only be made in Dollars. Immediately upon the making of a Swingline Loan, each Committed Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swingline Lender a risk participation in such Swingline Loan in an amount equal to such Committed Lender s Applicable Percentage of the principal amount of such Swingline Loan. 

(b) Borrowing Procedures . Each Borrowing under the Swingline shall be made upon the applicable Borrower Party s irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. on the requested Borrowing date, and shall: (i) specify the amount to be borrowed, which shall be in a principal amount that is not less than 1,000,000; (ii) specify the requested Borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day; and (iii) simultaneously request a Borrowing of a Base Rate Loan under Section 2.02 to repay such Swingline Loan. Each such notice must be by delivery to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice for such Swingline Loan and an applicable Syndicated Loan (to refinance such Swingline Loan), appropriately completed and 

47 

signed by a Responsible Officer of such Borrower Party. Promptly after receipt by the Administrative Agent of any Loan Notice for a Swingline Loan, Administrative Agent shall notify the Swingline Lender of the amount of the applicable Swingline Loan. Unless the Swingline Lender has received notice from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 12:00 noon on the date of the proposed Swingline Borrowing: (A) directing the Swingline Lender not to make such Swingline Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.07(a) ; or (B) that one (1) or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 7 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender will, not later than 4:00 p.m. on the Borrowing date specified in such Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swingline Loan available to the Administrative Agent s Office for the account of the applicable Borrower Party at its office in immediately available funds, and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth herein, Administrative Agent shall promptly deposit such proceeds in immediately available funds in such Borrower Party s account specified in the Loan Notice, or, if requested by such Borrower Party in the Loan Notice, shall wire transfer such funds as requested. Absent contrary written notice from the Swingline Lender prior to the proposed Borrowing date that the Swingline Lender will not make available to Administrative Agent the Swingline Loan, its Administrative Agent may assume that the Swingline Lender has made its share of the requested Swingline Loan available to Administrative Agent on the requested Borrowing date, and Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption (but is not required to), make available to the appropriate Borrower Party a corresponding amount by crediting the account of such Borrower Party specified in such Loan Notice. 
 (c) Refinancing of Swingline Loans . 

(i) To the extent a Loan Notice for a Syndicated Loan is not simultaneously delivered with a Loan Notice for a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the applicable Borrower Party (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender Group make a Syndicated Loan in an amount equal to such Lender Group s Applicable Percentage of the amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02 , but without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.03 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Available Commitment and the applicable conditions set forth in Section 7 . Promptly upon receipt of such Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Funding Agent by 1:00 p.m. at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date specified in such Loan Notice, specifying in such Loan Notice such Lender Group s Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans, and the Swingline Lender shall furnish the applicable Borrower Party with a copy of the applicable Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each (A) Conduit Lender may, and if a Conduit Lender does not, each Committed Lender in such Conduit Lender s Lender Group shall, and (B) each Committed Lender in a Lender Group without a Conduit Lender shall, upon receipt of such Loan Notice, make an amount equal to its Lender Group s Applicable Percentage (or, in the case of a Committed Lender, its Applicable Percentage) of the amount specified in such Loan Notice available (including for this purpose Cash Collateral and other credit support made available with respect to the applicable Swingline Loan) to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds for the account of the Swingline Lender not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.07(c)(ii) , each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have 

48 

made a Base Rate Loan to the applicable Borrower Party in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender. 
 (ii) If for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Base Rate Loan in accordance with Section 2.07(c)(i) , the request for Syndicated Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender that each of the Lender Groups fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan with a Base Rate Loan and each Lender Group s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.07(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. 

(iii) If any Lender Group fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender Group pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.07(c) by the time specified in Section 2.07(c)(i) , the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from the Committed Lenders in such Lender Group (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Swingline Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation; provided , however , that if such Lender Group fails to pay its amount upon Administrative Agent s demand, then: (A) promptly on demand, to the extent such funds are available in the applicable Collateral Account for such purpose; and (B) otherwise, to the extent that it is necessary for Borrower to issue Capital Call Notices to fund such required payment, within fifteen (15) Business Days after Administrative Agent s demand, Borrower shall issue such Capital Call Notices and shall make such payment promptly after the related Capital Contributions are received. A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Committed Lender (through the Administrative Agent and the applicable Funding Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(iv) Each Committed Lender s obligation to make Syndicated Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans on behalf of its Lender Group pursuant to this Section 2.07(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including: (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Committed Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, any Borrower Party or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default; or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided , however , that each Committed Lender s obligation to make Syndicated Loans pursuant to this Section 2.07(c) is subject to the applicable conditions set forth in Section 7 . No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower Party to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 

(d) Repayment of Participations . 

(i) At any time after any Lender Group has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if Administrative Agent receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender Group its share of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, 

49 

to reflect the period of time during which such Lender Group s risk participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by Administrative Agent. 
 (ii) If any payment received by Administrative Agent in respect of principal or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to be returned by Administrative Agent under any of the circumstances described in Section 13.04 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in its discretion), each Committed Lender on behalf of its Lender Group shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swingline Lender. The obligations of the Lender Groups and the Committed Lenders under this clause (ii) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligation and the termination of this Credit Agreement. 

(e) Interest for Account of Swingline Lender . The Administrative Agent shall be responsible for invoicing the applicable Borrower Party for interest on the Swingline Loans. Until each Lender Group funds its Syndicated Loans or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.07 to refinance such Lender Group s share of any Swingline Loan, interest in respect of such share shall be solely for the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender. 

(f) Payments Directly to Swingline Lender . The applicable Borrower Party shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swingline Loans directly to the Swingline Lender. 

2.08 Letters of Credit . 

(a) Letter of Credit Commitment . 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, on any Business Day during the Letter of Credit Availability Period: (A) the Letter of Credit Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Committed Lenders set forth in this Section 2.08 : (1) to issue Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars for the account of a Borrower Party, in aggregate face amounts that shall be not less than 100,000, as a Borrower Party may request (except to the extent a lesser amount is requested by such Borrower Party and agreed by Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer), and to amend or extend Letters of Credit previously issued by it; and (2) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit; and

Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, a Borrower Party s ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly a Borrower Party may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired (without any pending 
 50 

drawing) or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. The Letter of Credit Issuer shall have the right to approve the form of Letter of Credit requested. 
 (ii) The Letter of Credit Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit, if:

 (iii) The Letter of Credit Issuer shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if: 

(A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Letter of Credit Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the Letter of Credit Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Letter of Credit Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the Letter of Credit Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Letter of Credit Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the Letter of Credit Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the Letter of Credit Issuer in good faith deems material to it (for which the Letter of Credit Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder); 

(B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate any Law or one (1) or more policies of the Letter of Credit Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally; 

(C) such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than 

Dollars; 
 (D) such Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder; or

51 

Letter of Credit Liability as to which the Letter of Credit Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion. 
 (iv) The Letter of Credit Issuer shall not be under any obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if: (A) the Letter of Credit Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof; or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit. 

(v) The Letter of Credit Issuer shall act on behalf of Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the Letter of Credit Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities as: (A) provided to Administrative Agent in Section 12 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by Letter of Credit Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term Administrative Agent as used in Section 12 included Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions; and (B) additionally provided herein with respect to Letter of Credit Issuer. 

(b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit . 

(i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of a Borrower Party delivered to the Letter of Credit Issuer selected by such Borrower Party with respect to such Letter of Credit (with a copy to Administrative Agent) in the form of a Request for Credit Extension, together with a Borrowing Base Certificate, each appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of such Borrower Party. Such Request for Credit Extension may be sent by fax, by United States mail, by overnight courier, by electronic transmission using the system provided by the Letter of Credit Issuer, by personal delivery or by any other means reasonably acceptable to the Letter of Credit Issuer. Such Request for Credit Extension must be received by the Letter of Credit Issuer and Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be, of any Letter of Credit (or such later date and time as Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion). In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Request for Credit Extension shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the Letter of Credit Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; 

(C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the Letter of Credit Issuer may reasonably require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, the related Request for Credit Extension shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the Letter of Credit Issuer: (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other matters as the Letter of Credit Issuer may reasonably require. Additionally, the applicable Borrower Party shall furnish to the Letter of Credit Issuer and Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the Letter of Credit Issuer or Administrative Agent may reasonably require. Each Request for Credit Extension submitted by a Borrower Party shall be deemed to be a representation and 
 52 

warranty that the conditions specified in Section 7.02(a) and (b) have been satisfied on and as of the date of the issuance or amendment of any Letter of Credit. 
 (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Request for Credit Extension relating to a Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit Issuer will confirm with Administrative Agent that Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Request for Credit Extension from a Borrower Party and, if not, the Letter of Credit Issuer will provide Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. The Letter of Credit Issuer shall also promptly notify each Funding Agent (which in turn shall promptly notify each Committed Lender in its Lender Group) of the Request for Credit Extension and the terms thereof. Unless the Letter of Credit Issuer has received written notice from any Committed Lender, Administrative Agent or any Borrower Party, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one (1) or more applicable conditions contained in Section 7 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Letter of Credit Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of such Borrower Party or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the Letter of Credit Issuer s usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Committed Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Letter of Credit Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Committed Lender s Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit. With the approval of Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer, the risk participation of each Committed Lender shall terminate upon the occurrence of the Maturity Date and the full and final payment of the Obligations (other than the Cash Collateralized Letter of Credit Liability described below), and the Issuer Documents, rather than this Credit Agreement, shall govern the rights and obligations of Administrative Agent, Letter of Credit Issuer and Borrower Parties with respect to such Letter of Credit Liability, so long as Borrower has Cash Collateralized all Letter of Credit Liability then outstanding, to the reasonable satisfaction of Administrative Agent and Letter of Credit Issuer.

Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or clause (B) above, Borrower shall: (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender s participation in Letter of Credit Liability or Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below; (y) pay to the Letter of Credit Issuer and Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Letter of Credit Issuer s or Swingline Lender s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender; and (z) Borrower shall not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. 

(iv) Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure . All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in Letter of Credit Liability and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among each Non-Defaulting Lender (based on its Committed Lender Percentage (without giving effect to the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender)) calculated as the product of its Lender Group s Lender Group Percentage (without giving effect to the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender) multiplied by the principal amount of such participation, but only to the extent that: (x) the conditions set forth in Section 7.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless Borrower shall have otherwise notified Administrative Agent at such time, Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time); and (y) such reallocation does not cause (i) the aggregate revolving credit exposure and Letter of Credit Liability of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non- Defaulting Lender s Commitment or (ii) the revolving credit exposure and Letter of Credit Liability of any Lender Group to exceed the aggregate Commitments of its Non-Defaulting Lenders. Subject to Section 13.28 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Committed Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non- Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 

(v) Cash Collateral . If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lender s Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the Letter of Credit Issuer s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.14 . 

64 

(b) Defaulting Lender Cure . If Borrower, Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and the Letter of Credit Issuer agree in writing that a Committed Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Committed Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion (not otherwise funded by its Lender Group) of outstanding Syndicated Loans of the other Lender Groups or take such other actions as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Syndicated Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held among the Lender Groups (and the Committed Lenders therein) in accordance with their Applicable Percentages, whereupon such Committed Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made 

65 

retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrower while that Committed Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided , further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Committed Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Committed Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 
 2.16 Extension of Stated Maturity Date . So long as no (x) Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the Stated Maturity Date and (y) the representations and warranties contained in Section 8 or in any other Loan Document shall be true and correct in all material respects on, and as of, the Stated Maturity Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.16 , the representations and warranties contained in Section 8.06 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent financial statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) , respectively, of Section 9.01 , Borrower may request to extend the Stated Maturity Date to a Business Day that is not later than three hundred sixty-four (364) days after the then-effective Stated Maturity Date, upon (the date such conditions are satisfied, the Facility Extension Effective Date ):

 3. PAYMENT OF OBLIGATIONS . 

3.01 Notes . 

(a) The Borrowings funded by each Lender shall be evidenced by one (1) or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender (or its Funding Agent) and by Administrative Agent in the Register in the ordinary course of business. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of such Borrower Party hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender (or its Funding Agent, if applicable) and the accounts and records of Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 

(b) Any Funding Agent, on behalf of any Lender member of its Lender Group, may request that the Syndicated Loans to be made by such Lender Group to the Borrower shall be evidenced by promissory notes. Swingline Loans and Qualified Borrower obligations shall not be evidenced by separate promissory notes. If so requested, the Borrower shall issue such Notes. Each such Note shall: (a) be payable to the Funding Agent for such Lender Group or such other administrator or trustee for the Lender member of such Lender Group as such Funding Agent may designate (or, if requested by such Funding Agent, to such Funding Agent and its registered assigns); (b) bear interest in accordance with the provisions hereof; (c) be in the form of Exhibit B , attached hereto (with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith); and (d) be made by the Borrower. The Borrower agrees, from time to time, upon the request of Administrative Agent

 3.02 Payment of Interest . 

(a) Interest . Interest on each Borrowing and any portion thereof shall commence to accrue in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents as of the date of the disbursal or wire transfer of such Borrowing by Administrative Agent, consistent with the provisions of Sections 2.06 and 2.13 , notwithstanding whether any Borrower Party received the benefit of such Borrowing as of such date and even if such Borrowing is held in escrow pursuant to the terms of any escrow arrangement or agreement. When a Borrowing is disbursed by wire transfer pursuant to instructions received from a Borrower Party, then such Borrowing shall be considered made at the time of the transmission of the wire, in accordance with the Loan Notice, rather than the time of receipt thereof by the receiving bank. With regard to the repayment of the Loans, interest shall continue to accrue on any amount repaid until such time as the repayment has been received in federal or other Same Day Funds by Administrative Agent. 

(b) Interest Payment Dates . Except with respect to Swingline Loans, which are addressed by Section 2.07(a) , accrued and unpaid interest on the Obligations, including any interest payable on any Loan prepaid pursuant to Section 3.05 , shall be due and payable in arrears (i) on each Interest Payment Date (for the immediately preceding calendar month) and on the Maturity Date; (ii) on each other date of any reduction of the Principal Obligations hereunder (other than a voluntary prepayment pursuant to Section 3.05 and (iii) with respect to any obligation of a Borrower Party hereunder on which such Borrower Party is in default, at any time and from time to time following such default upon demand by Administrative Agent. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law. 

(c) Direct Disbursement . If, at any time, Administrative Agent or the Letter of Credit Issuer shall not have received on the date due, any payment of interest upon the Loans or any fee described herein, Administrative Agent may direct the disbursement of funds from the applicable Collateral Account to Lenders in accordance with the terms hereof, to the extent available therein for payment of any such amount. 

3.03 Payments of Obligations . 

(a) Maturity Date . The principal amount of the Obligations outstanding on the Maturity Date, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any other Obligations then outstanding, shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date. Each Borrower Party shall repay each Swingline Loan made to such Borrower Party on the earlier to occur of (i) the date three (3) Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made and (ii) the Maturity Date; provided , that, if an Event of Default shall occur, then all Swingline Loans shall immediately become due and payable. 

(b) Payments Generally . All payments of principal of, and interest on, the Obligations under this Credit Agreement by any Borrower Party to or for the account of Lenders, or any of them, shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff by such Borrower Party. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein all 

67 

payments by the Borrower Parties hereunder shall be made to Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders and Lender Groups to which such payment is owed, at Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Credit Agreement be made in the United States. Funds received by Administrative Agent after 1:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars shall in each case be treated for all purposes as having been received by Administrative Agent on the first Business Day next following receipt of such funds and any applicable interest or fees shall continue to accrue. Except as provided in Section 13.11(c) hereof, and except for Swingline Loans repaid to the Swingline Lender before the provisions of Section 2.07(d)(i) become applicable, each Lender shall be entitled to receive its applicable share of each payment received by Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of Lenders on the Obligations. Each payment received by Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of a Lender shall be promptly distributed by Administrative Agent to the appropriate Funding Agent. If any payment to be made by any Borrower Party shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. Each Funding Agent agrees to use reasonable efforts to apply the amounts received in respect of such repayments to the outstanding Loans of the Lenders members of its Lender Group so as to minimize broken funding payments payable pursuant to Section 4.05 . 
 (c) Clawback . 

(i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Funding Agent prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans or CP Rate Loan (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Daily SOFR Loans or Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender Group will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender Group s share of such Borrowing, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender Group has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.04 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Daily SOFR Loans or Base Rate Loans, that such Lender Group has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.04 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower Party a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender Group has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to Administrative Agent, then the Committed Lenders in such Lender Group and the applicable Borrower Party severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower Party to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at: (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Committed Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing; and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by a Borrower Party, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans; provided , however , that if funds are not available to such Borrower Party in the Collateral Account to make payment on demand, to the extent that it is necessary for Borrower to issue Capital Call Notices to fund such required payment, such payment shall be made within fifteen (15) Business Days after Administrative Agent s demand (and, in any event, Borrower shall issue such Capital Call Notices and shall make such payment promptly after the related Capital Contributions are received). If any Borrower Party and such Committed Lender shall pay such interest to Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower Party the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower 

68 

Party for such period. If such Committed Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Committed Lender s Syndicated Loan included in such Borrowing as of the date of such Borrowing. Any payment by a Borrower Party shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower Party may have against a Committed Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to Administrative Agent. 
 (ii) Payments by Borrower Parties; Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower Party prior to the date on which any payment is due to Administrative Agent for the account of the Funding Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder that such Borrower Party will not make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower Party has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Funding Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Letter of Credit Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower Party has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Committed Lenders or the Letter of Credit Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Funding Agent s Lender Group or the Letter of Credit Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. 

A notice of Administrative Agent to any Committed Lender or any Borrower Party with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 (d) General Order of Application . Each such repayment shall be applied to repay all outstanding Loans (other than any Swingline Loan) ratably or such Swingline Loan, as applicable. All payments made on the Obligations shall be credited, to the extent of the amount thereof, in the following order: (a) against all costs, expenses and other fees (including Attorney Costs) arising under the terms hereof; (b) against the amount of interest accrued and unpaid on the Obligations as of the date of such payment; (c) against all principal due and owing on the Obligations as of the date of such payment; and (d) to all other amounts constituting any portion of the Obligations. 

3.04 Mandatory Prepayment . 

(a) Excess Loans Outstanding . If, on any day, the Principal Obligation exceeds the Available Commitment (including, without limitation, as a result of an Exclusion Event, the delivery of an Initial Notice or the application of the Concentration Limits (a Mandatory Prepayment Event )), then the applicable Borrower Party shall pay to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, an amount sufficient that, after giving effect to such prepayment and any Capital Calls to fund such prepayment, the Principal Obligation would no longer exceed the Available Commitment (except to the extent any Swingline Loan is outstanding and the applicable Borrower Party elects to pay all or any portion of such excess with respect to any Swingline Loan, in which case such payment shall be for the benefit of Swingline Lender) (such amount, Required Payment ), in Same Day Funds: (a) promptly on demand (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after such demand), to the extent such funds are available in the Collateral Account (unless such funds in the Collateral Account have been designated to be used for contractually obligated Portfolio Assets (and satisfactory evidence of such obligation has been provided to Administrative Agent) and a Pending Capital Call exists in an amount sufficient to make such Required Payment); and (b) within ten (10) Business Days of demand to the extent that it is necessary for Borrower to issue Capital Call Notices to fund such Required Payment (and Borrower 

69 

shall issue such Capital Call Notices during such time and shall pay such Required Payment promptly after the Capital Contributions relating to such Capital Call Notice are received), together with all funds then on deposit in the Collateral Account equal the Required Payment to be paid pursuant to this Section 3.04(a) . 
 (b) Excess Letters of Credit Outstanding . To the extent that any excess calculated pursuant to Section 3.04(a) is attributable to undrawn Letters of Credit, then the applicable Borrower Party may Cash Collateralize the Letter of Credit Liability in the amount of such excess, when required pursuant to the terms of Section 3.04(a) . To the extent that the Letter of Credit Liability exceeds the Available Commitment, the applicable Borrower Parties shall Cash Collateralize such Letter of Credit Liability in an amount equal to the excess of the Letter of Credit Liability over the Available Commitment. Unless otherwise required by law, upon: (A) a change in circumstances such that such amount no longer remains outstanding; or (B) the full and final payment of the Obligations, Administrative Agent shall return to the applicable Borrower Party any remaining Cash Collateral as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event within two (2) Business Days. 

(c) Reorganization . On the effective date of a Reorganization, the Borrower shall prepay the Obligations in full and the Commitments shall simultaneously terminate, and no Reorganization shall be effective until the Obligations are paid in full. 

3.05 Voluntary Prepayments . Any Borrower Party may, upon delivery of a Prepayment Notice to Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that: (a) with respect to Swingline Loans, the principal of any Swingline Loan may be prepaid by 11:00 a.m. on any Business Day, and any prepayment not received by 11:00 a.m. on such Business Day shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day; and (b) with respect to any other Loan, such notice must be received by Administrative Agent not later than: (A) 11:00 a.m. three (3) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of any Loans accruing interest at Term SOFR, Floating SOFR or the CP Rate; and (B) 11:00 a.m. one (1) Business Day prior to any date of prepayment of any Daily SOFR Loans or Base Rate Loans; and (c) any prepayment of Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of 1,000,000 or a whole multiple of 100,000 in excess thereof; or, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such Prepayment Notice shall specify the date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of such prepayment, if applicable, the Type(s) of Syndicated Loans to be prepaid. Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Funding Agent of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of its Lender Group s Repayment Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by a Borrower Party, such Borrower Party shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. With respect to any Loan prepaid pursuant to this Section 3.05 , all accrued interest thereon shall be paid in accordance with Section 3.02(b) and any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 4 with respect thereto shall be promptly paid following receipt of an accurate and correct invoice for such amounts. Subject to Section 2.15 , each such prepayment shall be applied to the Principal Obligation held by each Lender in accordance with its applicable Repayment Percentage. 

3.06 Reduction or Early Termination of Commitments . Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the aggregate Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. three (3) Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of 5,000,000 or any whole multiple of 1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Maximum Commitment hereunder shall at no time equal an aggregate amount of less than 25,000,000, (iv) Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Principal Obligation would exceed 

70 

the Available Commitments; and (v) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the aggregate Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit exceeds the amount of the aggregate Commitments, such Letter of Credit Sublimit or Swingline Sublimit, as applicable, shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Committed Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the aggregate Commitments. Any reduction of the aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Committed Lender according to its pro rata share thereof. All fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. 
 3.07 Lending Office . Each Lender may: (a) designate the principal office or a branch, subsidiary or Affiliate of such Lender as its Lending Office (and the office to whose accounts payments are to be credited) for any Loan; and (b) change its Lending Office from time to time by notice to Administrative Agent and Borrower. In such event, the Funding Agent for such Lender shall continue to hold the Note, if any, evidencing its Loans for the benefit and account of such branch, subsidiary or Affiliate. Each Committed Lender shall be entitled to fund all or any portion of its Commitment in any manner it deems appropriate, consistent with the provisions of Section 2.06 , but for the purposes of this Credit Agreement such Committed Lender shall, regardless of such Committed Lender s actual means of funding, be deemed to have funded its Commitment in accordance with the Relevant Rate selected from time to time by the Borrower Parties for such Borrowing period.

(C) any Foreign Recipient shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign 

74 

Recipient becomes a Lender under this Credit Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Administrative Agent), any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower Party or Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
 (D) if a payment made to a Recipient under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Recipient were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Recipient shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Borrower and Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Recipient has complied with such Recipient s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D) , FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Credit Agreement. 

(iii) Each Recipient agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 4.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower and Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 

(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds . If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion, exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower Parties or with respect to which any Borrower Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 4.01 , it shall pay to such Borrower Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower Party under this Section 4.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that each Borrower Party, upon the request of such Recipient, agree to repay the amount paid over to any such Borrower Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Recipient in the event such Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection , in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to a Borrower Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower Parties or any other Person. 

(g) Defined Terms . For purposes of this Section 4.01 , the term Lender includes the Letter of Credit Issuer and any Liquidity Provider and the term applicable Law includes FATCA

76 

4.02 Illegality . If any Funding Party determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Funding Party or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to any SOFR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon any SOFR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Funding Party to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the applicable offshore interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Funding Party to Borrower Parties through its Funding Agent and the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Funding Party to make or continue Daily SOFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans, or to convert Loans to Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended until such Funding Party notifies its Funding Agent (which promptly notifies Administrative Agent and Borrower Parties) that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice the applicable Borrower Party shall, upon demand from such Funding Party (with a copy to Administrative Agent), convert all Daily SOFR Loans and Term SOFR Loans of such Funding Party to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Funding Party may lawfully continue to maintain such Loans to such day, or, if such Funding Party may not lawfully continue to maintain such Loans, immediately. Upon any such conversion, each such Borrower Party shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted. 

4.03 Inability to Determine Rates; Market Disruption . 

(a) Temporary Unavailability . If in connection with any request for a Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof: 

(i) Administrative Agent determines that: (A) deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan; or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the SOFR Rate (1) for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan or (2) in connection with an existing or proposed Daily SOFR Loan including, without limitation, because the SOFR Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are likely to be temporary; or 

(ii) Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Funding Parties of funding such Loan; then 

(iii) Administrative Agent will promptly so notify Borrower Parties and each Funding Party; and 

(iv) as long as no alternative rate described in clause (a)(v) below has been established, then, (A) the obligation of the Funding Parties, as applicable, to make or maintain Daily SOFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans in the affected currency or currencies 

77 

shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods); and 
 (v) notwithstanding the foregoing, if Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) or clause (a)(ii) above, Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Required Lenders and with the consent of the Borrower Parties, may establish an alternative rate to be used in substitution for the SOFR Rate in calculating the interest rate for the impacted Loans, in which case such alternative rate shall apply in calculating interest with respect to the impacted Loans until (A) Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the impacted Loans under clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, (B) Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders notify Administrative Agent and Borrower that such alternative rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Funding Parties of funding the impacted Loans, or (C) any Funding Party determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Funding Party or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Funding Party to do any of the foregoing and provides Administrative Agent and Borrower written notice thereof.

(i) Benchmark Replacement . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document (and any agreement executed in connection with a Swap Contract shall be deemed not to be a Loan Document for purposes of this Section ), if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (A) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document and (B) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. 

(ii) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes . In connection with the implementation and administration of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any

further action or consent of any other party to this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document.

(B) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (C) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes, (D) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to paragraph (iv) below and (E) the commencement of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section . 
 (iv) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (A) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate and either (I) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (II) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (B) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (A) above either (I) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (II) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 

(v) Benchmark Unavailability Period . Upon the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Loan bearing interest based on Term SOFR or Daily SOFR, conversion to or continuation of Loans bearing interest based on Term SOFR or Daily SOFR to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Base Rate Loan or conversion to Base Rate Loans. 

4.04 Increased Costs Generally . 

(a) Change in Law . If any Change in Law shall: 

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Funding Party; 

79 

(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than: (A) Indemnified Taxes; 

80

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Funding Party of making, converting, continuing, funding, or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make or fund any such Loan or to advance funds under a Liquidity Agreement), or to increase the cost to such Funding Party of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Funding Party (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Funding Party (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a certificate provided under subsection (c) of this Section 4.04 ), the applicable Borrower Party will pay to such Funding Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Funding Party for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided , however , that if funds are not available to such Borrower Party in the Collateral Account, to the extent that it is necessary for Borrower to issue Capital Call Notices to fund such required compensation, such payment shall be made within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of a certificate provided under subsection (c) of this Section 4.04 . 
 (b) Capital Requirements . If any Funding Party determines that any Change in Law affecting such Funding Party, any Lending Office of such Funding Party or such Funding Party s holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements or liquidity has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Funding Party s capital or on the capital of such Funding Party s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Credit Agreement, the Commitments of such Funding Party or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Funding Party, the Letters of Credit issued by the Letter of Credit Issuer or any obligation to advance funds under a Liquidity Agreement, to a level below that which such Funding Party or such Funding Party s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Funding Party s policies and the policies of such Funding Party s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and such Funding Party s desired return on capital), then from time to time the applicable Borrower Party will pay to such Funding Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Funding Party or such Funding Party s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 

(c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Funding Party setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Funding Party or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 4.04 and delivered to a Borrower Party shall be conclusive absent manifest error. In determining such amount, such Funding Party may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. 

(d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Funding Party to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Funding Party s right to demand such compensation, provided that no Borrower Party shall 

81 

be required to compensate a Funding Party pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.04 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Funding Party notifies Borrower Parties of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Funding Party s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine (9) month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
 (e) Additional Reserve Requirements . Borrower Parties shall pay to each Funding Party: (i) as long as such Funding Party shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as eurocurrency liabilities ), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Term SOFR Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Funding Party (as determined by such Funding Party in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and 

(ii) as long as such Funding Party shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of Term SOFR Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Funding Party (as determined by such Funding Party in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided Borrower Parties shall have received at least ten (10) Business Days prior notice (with a copy to Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Funding Party. If a Funding Party fails to give notice ten (10) Business Days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and payable ten (10) Business Days from receipt of such notice. 
 4.05 Compensation for Losses . Upon demand of any Funding Party (with a copy to Administrative Agent) from time to time, each applicable Borrower Party shall promptly compensate such Funding Party, as applicable, for and hold such Funding Party harmless from any loss, cost or expense (but excluding loss of anticipated profits) as reasonably determined by the applicable Funding Agent actually incurred by it as a result of: 

(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Daily SOFR Loan or a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 

(b) any failure by such Borrower Party (for a reason other than the failure of such Funding Party to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan, in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement, other than a Daily SOFR Loan or Base Rate Loan, on the date or in the amount notified by such Borrower Party ((including, in the case of any Conduit Lender, pursuant to a Liquidity Agreement) by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of funds acquired by such Lender (or the applicable Liquidity Provider(s)) (including funds obtained by issuing commercial paper or promissory notes or obtaining deposits or loans from third parties) in order to fund such Borrowing, continuation or conversion); and 

(c) any assignment of a Term SOFR Loan or CP Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by such Borrower Party pursuant to Section 13.13 ; 

82 

including any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense (but excluding any loss of anticipated profits) arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. Each applicable Borrower Party shall also pay the customary administrative fees charged by such Lender or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, in connection with the foregoing. 
 For purposes of calculating amounts payable by any Borrower Party to any applicable Funding Party under this Section 4.05 , each applicable Funding Party shall be deemed to have funded each Term SOFR Loan made by it at Term SOFR for such Loan by a matching deposit or other Borrowing in the offshore interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Term SOFR Loan was in fact so funded. In the case of a CP Rate Loan, the actual out-of-pocket loss to any Conduit Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Conduit Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such CP Rate Loan from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan, if the interest rate payable on such amount were calculated by reference to the CP Rate for such Interest Period, over (ii) the sum of (x) to the extent all or a portion of such principal amount remains outstanding hereunder, the amount of interest actually accrued during the remainder of such Interest Period on such principal amount, and (y) to the extent such principal amount does not remain outstanding hereunder, the income, if any, actually received during the remainder of such period by the Conduit Lender from investing such portion of such principal amount. 
 With respect to any Lender that is not a bank, the foregoing calculation shall be made using the rates that would be applicable to the applicable Funding Agent as a proxy for such Lender. A certificate of a Funding Party setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Funding Party or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in this Section 4.05 and delivered to a Borrower Party shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 4.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Funding Party . 

(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office . If any Funding Party requests compensation under Section 4.04 , or requires a Borrower Party to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Funding Party or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Funding Party pursuant to Section 4.01 , or if any Funding Party gives a notice pursuant to Section 4.02 , then, at the request of Borrower, such Funding Party shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans or for issuing Letters of Credit hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the good faith judgment of such Funding Party, such designation or assignment: 

(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.01 or Section 4.04 , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 4.02 ; and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Funding Party to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Funding Party. Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Funding Party in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
 (b) Replacement of Funding Party . If (i) any Funding Party requests compensation under Section 4.04 , (ii) any Borrower Party is required to pay Indemnified Taxes or any additional amounts to any Funding Party or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Funding Party pursuant to Section 4.01 and in each case such Funding Party has declined or is unable to designate 

83 

a different Lending Office in accordance with Section 4.06(a) or such designation does not eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.01 to the same extent, (iii) any Committed Lender is unwilling or unable to fund Term SOFR Loans, (iv) any Committed Lender does not consent to an amendment or waiver under Section 13.01 or (v) any Committed Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, Borrower may, at its sole cost and effort, replace such Funding Party s Lender Group in accordance with Section 13.13 ; provided , however , that a Lender Group shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Funding Party or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

In order to secure further the payment and performance of the Obligations and to effect and facilitate Secured Parties rights of setoff, Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) as subscription agent and the sole party entitled in the name of Borrower upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (but subject to Section 11.03 ), to make any Capital Calls upon the Investors pursuant to (and to the extent permitted by) the terms of the applicable Subscription Agreements and the Operating Agreement. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term Collateral shall not include (a) any ERISA Investor Excluded Items if such provision of such ERISA Investor Excluded Item or the exercise of remedies with respect to such ERISA Investor Excluded Item would be a prohibited transaction for purposes of Section 406 of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or other applicable law, (b) the Capital Commitments or any assets, interests, rights or obligations of the SOX Insiders, if any, unless so elected by the Borrower Parties in their discretion, (c) any Portfolio Assets and (d) any funds properly withdrawn or transferred from the Collateral Account to the extent used for any purpose permitted under the Operating Agreement and this Credit Agreement, and the proceeds of such withdrawn funds.

84 

updated from time to time upon written agreement of the Borrower Parties and the Administrative Agent). Any AML Account shall be used solely for the purpose of holding Capital Contributions until such time as the Fund Administrator completes its required diligence on the source of such deposited Capital Contributions and undertakes any other checks as may be required to comply with its internal anti-money laundering procedures (collectively, the AML Procedures ). Borrower, Administrative Agent, the Fund Administrator and, to the extent applicable, any other applicable Person becoming a party to any Loan Document as a Borrower, shall, prior to permitting any Investor to fund any Capital Contributions into an AML Account, enter into a letter agreement or letter agreements (each, individually, an AML Account Restriction Agreement and collectively, the AML Account Restriction Agreements pursuant to which the Fund Administrator agrees, among other things, that it shall only transfer funds on deposit in the applicable AML Account to the Collateral Account of the Borrower, other than any funds on deposit that the Fund Administrator reasonably determines must be returned to any Investor or transferred to a Governmental Authority for failure to meet the AML Procedures. In addition, to the extent that Borrower receives any payments and monies directly from any Investor as Capital Contributions in any account other than an AML Account or a Collateral Account, Borrower shall immediately deposit such Capital Contributions into the applicable AML Account or Collateral Account. Borrower shall not replace, permit the replacement of or cause the replacement of the Fund Administrator at any time, unless (i) Borrower provides Administrative Agent with prior written notice of such anticipated replacement, (ii) such replacement fund administrator is acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion and (iii) Borrower causes any replacement fund administrator to execute and deliver an AML Account Restriction Agreement for each AML Account in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent. At all times the Collateral Account shall be held at the Depository and the Depository shall be an Eligible Institution. 
 (b) No Duty .

None of them shall have any duty to determine or inquire into any happening or occurrence or any performance or failure of performance of Borrower, or any Investor. None of them has any duty to inquire into the use, purpose, or reasons for the making of any Capital Call or with respect to the investment or the use of the proceeds thereof. 

(c) Capital Calls . In order that Secured Parties may monitor the Collateral and the Capital Commitments, Borrower shall not issue any Capital Call Notice without delivering to Administrative Agent (which delivery may be by any one (1) or more means of physical delivery, via facsimile or via email) promptly after the delivery of Capital Call Notice(s) to Investors, 

(i) copies of all such Capital Call Notices and (ii) a Borrowing Base Certificate pursuant to 
 Section 9.01(f) . 
 (d) Use of Account . Borrower may withdraw funds from the Collateral Account (but not from the AML Account) at any time or from time to time, so long as at the time of such withdrawal or disbursement and after giving effect thereto: (i) there does not exist an Event of Default; (ii) there does not exist a Default under Sections 11.01(a) , 11.01(g) or 11.01(h) ; and 

(iii) the Principal Obligation does not exceed the Available Commitment (unless, in each case, Borrower has directed that such disbursement be paid to Administrative Agent for application to 
 85 

the Obligations pursuant to this Credit Agreement); provided that any withdrawal or disbursement to pay Permitted RIC Distributions shall not be subject to the restrictions in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) and shall be permitted so long as at the time of such withdrawal or disbursement and after giving effect thereto, there does not exist an Event of Default under Sections 11.01(a) , 11.01(g) or 11.01(h) . Upon the exercise of a notice of control in accordance with Sections 11.02 and 11.03 , pursuant to the terms of the Deposit Account Control Agreement, Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs Secured Parties, acting through Administrative Agent, to charge from time to time its Collateral Account for amounts not paid when due (after the passage of any applicable grace period) to Secured Parties or any of them hereunder, under any Letter of Credit Application, under any Letter of Credit or under the Notes. Regardless of any provision hereof, in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct by Administrative Agent or Secured Parties, none of Administrative Agent or Secured Parties shall ever be liable for failure to collect or for failure to exercise diligence in the collection, possession, or any transaction concerning, all or part of the Capital Call Notices, Capital Commitments, or any Capital Contributions, or sums due or paid thereon. Administrative Agent shall give Borrower prompt notice of any action taken pursuant to this Section 5.02(d) , but failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such action or give rise to any defense in favor of Borrower with respect to such action. 
 (e) Electronic Access to Collateral Account . In order to verify the deposits and withdrawals in each Collateral Account, and in addition to any other information reasonably requested by Administrative Agent with respect to a Collateral Account (including monthly bank statements), Borrower shall cause the Depository to provide Administrative Agent with continuous online monitoring access, effective as of the Closing Date. 

(f) Other Accounts . Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, Borrower may maintain other bank accounts or securities accounts in addition to the Collateral Account that will not be considered Collateral or a Collateral Account and such other accounts shall not be subject to control agreements or other restrictions, provided that, for avoidance of doubt, all Capital Contributions shall be directed and deposited as provided above. 

6. BORROWER GUARANTY . 

6.01 Unconditional Guaranty of Payment . Borrower hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and absolutely guarantees in favor of each Secured Party, the prompt payment when due of all interest, principal, fees, expenses and other amounts now or hereafter represented by, or arising in connection with all Obligations of each Qualified Borrower now or hereafter arising (collectively, the Guaranteed Debt ).

If, at any time prior to or during such three (3) Business Day notice period, the Borrower Parties shall, on no more than one (1) occasion prior to the Maturity Date, make a Capital Call on the Unfunded Commitments of the Investors to repay the outstanding Obligations within the period ending fifteen (15) Business Days from the end of the initial three (3) Business Day notice period, sufficient (together with amounts on deposit in or credited to the Collateral Account) to cure each such Event of Default (to the extent such Event of Default may be cured via repayment) or repay the outstanding Obligations (and Cash Collateralize Letter of Credit Liability) in full, as applicable, then Administrative Agent, the Lenders and other Secured Parties may not exercise any such remedy until the expiration of the period ending fifteen (15) Business Days from the end of the initial three (3) Business Day notice period, provided that nothing in this Section 11.03(a) shall prohibit Administrative Agent, any Lender or other Secured Party from (i) asserting exclusive control of the Collateral Account, 

(ii) taking any such actions as may be required to protect their rights in a bankruptcy proceeding, or (iii) after the application of the proceeds received in response to any such Capital Call, in the event such Event of Default or another Event of Default is continuing, accelerating the Obligations or terminating the Commitments; provided , further , that to the extent that (A) the Borrower does not make such Capital Call or (B) the application of the proceeds of any such Capital Call are not sufficient (together with amounts on deposit in or credited to the Collateral Account) to cure such Event of Default or repay the outstanding Obligations (and Cash Collateralize Letter of Credit Liability) in full, as applicable, then, so long as such Event of Default shall be continuing, the Administrative Agent may, in accordance with the terms hereof, issue a Capital Call in an amount sufficient (together with amounts on deposit in or credited to the Collateral Account) to cure such Event of Default (to the extent such Event of Default may be cured via repayment) or repay the outstanding Obligations (and Cash Collateralize Letter of Credit Liability) in full, as applicable, or exercise any other remedy with respect to the Collateral. 
 (b) In the event that Administrative Agent elects to notify the Investors to make Capital Contributions in respect of their Unfunded Commitments, then Administrative Agent shall not request any individual Investor to fund an amount exceeding such Investor s pro-rata share of the Obligations (based on the proportion of such Investor s Unfunded Commitment to the aggregate Unfunded Commitments of all Investors other than Defaulting Investors) without first making best efforts (consistent with the terms of the Constituent Documents and applicable Law) to issue a Capital Call (which may be issued by Borrower or Administrative Agent) to each Investor for its pro-rata share of the Obligations and waiting fifteen (15) Business Days following such Capital Call prior to initiating further remedies. Further, without the prior written consent of Borrower, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender may contact any Investor, other than during the 

110

 11.04 Performance by Administrative Agent . Should any Borrower Party fail to perform any covenant, duty, or agreement contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, and such failure continues beyond any applicable cure period, Administrative Agent may (subject to Section 10.03 ), but shall not be obligated to, perform or attempt to perform such covenant, duty, or agreement on behalf of such Person. In such event, each Borrower Party shall, at the request of Administrative Agent promptly pay any reasonable amount expended by Administrative Agent in such performance or attempted performance to Administrative Agent at Administrative Agent s Office, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date of such expenditure until paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood that neither any of the Agents nor any of the other Secured Parties assume any liability or responsibility for the performance of any duties of any Borrower Party, or any related Person hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents or other control over the management and affairs of any Borrower Party, or any related Person, nor by any such action shall any of the Agents or other Secured Parties be deemed to create a partnership arrangement with any Borrower Party or any related Person.

 (d) Administrative Agent does not warrant, nor accept responsibility for, nor shall Administrative Agent have any liability with respect to the administration submission or any other matter related to the rates in the definition of SOFR Rate or with respect to any comparable or successor rate thereto.

The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Loans acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender or Letter of Credit Issuer shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Loan (or portion thereof), and the Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender or Letter of Credit Issuer (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf).

 124 

amendment, change, waiver, discharge, termination, consent or exercise of rights covered by this Credit Agreement, and such Lender shall respond to such request within ten (10) Business Days. 
 13.02 Right of Setoff . If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, Swingline Lender, the Letter of Credit Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time (but subject to Section 11.03 ), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, Swingline Lender, the Letter of Credit Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower Party against any and all of the Obligations of such Borrower Party now or hereafter existing under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document owing to such Lender, Swingline Lender or the Letter of Credit Issuer or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not Administrative Agent, such Lender, Swingline Lender, the Letter of Credit Issuer or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations of such Borrower Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender, Swingline Lender or the Letter of Credit Issuer different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided , that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff: (a) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.15 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer, Swingline Lender and the Committed Lenders; and 

(b) such Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender, the Letter of Credit Issuer, Swingline Lender and their respective Affiliates under this Section 13.02 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, the Letter of Credit Issuer, Swingline Lender or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender, Swingline Lender and the Letter of Credit Issuer agrees to notify the applicable Borrower Party and Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application made by such Person, provided , however , that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
 13.03 Sharing of Payments by Lender Group . If any Lender Group shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Syndicated Loans made by it, or the participations in the Letter of Credit Liability or in Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender Group receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Syndicated Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its Applicable Percentage thereof, then the Funding Agent of such Lender Group receiving such greater proportion shall: 

(a) notify Administrative Agent of such fact; and 

(b) cause the Committed Lenders in such Funding Agent s Lender Group to purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Syndicated Loans and subparticipations in the Letter of Credit Liability and Swingline Loans of the other Lender Groups, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lender Groups ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Syndicated Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that: 

(i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 

125 

(ii) the provisions of this Section 13.03 shall not be construed to apply to:

 Each Borrower Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Committed Lender or any Lender Group acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Committed Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower Party in the amount of such participation. 
 13.04 Payments Set Aside . To the extent that any Borrower Party makes a payment to Administrative Agent or any Lender, or Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then: (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, in the applicable currency of such recovery or payment.

The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan Document, are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Borrower Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at Law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 11.02 for the benefit of all Lenders, Swingline Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer; provided , however , that the foregoing shall not prohibit: (a) Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; (b) the Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; (c) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 13.02 (subject to the terms of Section 11.03 and Section 13.03 ); or (d) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Borrower Party under any Debtor Relief 
 127 

Law; and provided , further , that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; then: (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.02 ; and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b) , (c) and (d) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 13.03 , any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders.

 13.11 Successors and Assigns . 

(a) Successors and Assigns Generally . The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Borrower Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except: (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of clauses (b) and (i) of this Section 13.11 and Section 13.12 ; (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of clause (f) of this Section 13.11 ; or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment or grant of a security interest subject to the restrictions of clause (g) of this Section 13.11 (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Credit Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in clause (f) of this Section 13.11 , and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Credit Agreement. 

(b) Assignments by Lenders . Any Lender may at any time assign to one (1) or more Eligible Assignees (each, an Assignee all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this clause (b) , participations in Letter of Credit Liability) at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 

(i) Minimum Amounts . 

(A) In the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Committed Lender s Commitment and/or the Syndicated Loans at the time owing to it, contemporaneous assignments to related Approved Funds that equal at least the amount specified in clause (b)(i)(B) of this Section 13.11 in the aggregate, or, in the case of an assignment to a Committed Lender, an Affiliate of a Committed Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 

(B) in any case not described in subclause (A) above, the aggregate amount of the Commitments (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitments are not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption Agreement with respect to such assignment is delivered to Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than 5,000,000, unless each of Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower, otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent 

133 

assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Assignee (or to an Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met. 
 (ii) Proportionate Amounts . Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned. 

(iii) Required Consents . No consent shall be required for any assignment except: (A) as provided in the definition of Eligible Assignee (B) the consent of each Letter of Credit Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) shall be required for any assignment (other than to a Liquidity Provider) that increases the obligation of the Assignee to participate in exposure under one (1) or more Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding); and (C) the consent of the Swingline Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) shall be required for any assignment (other than to a Liquidity Provider) that increases the obligation of the Assignee to participate in exposure under a Swingline Loan (whether or not then outstanding). For the avoidance of doubt, no consent shall be required for any assignment from a Conduit Lender to a Conduit Assignee or a Liquidity Provider. 

(iv) Assignment and Assumption Agreement . Other than an assignment by a Conduit Lender to a Conduit Assignee or a Liquidity Provider, the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of 

3,500 (except in the case of a transfer at the demand of Borrower under Section 13.13 , in which case either Borrower or the transferee Lender shall pay such fee); provided , however , that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire. 
 (v) No Assignment to Certain Persons . No such assignment shall be made: 

(A) to a Borrower Party or any Affiliate or Subsidiary of any Borrower Party; (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B) ; 
 (C) to a natural person; (D) to any Person that is not a Qualified Purchaser; or (E) to any Person that is not an Eligible Assignee. 
 (vi) Borrower Requested Assignments . Each assignment made as a result of a demand by Borrower under Section 13.13 shall be arranged by Borrower after consultation with Administrative Agent and shall be either an assignment of all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Credit Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently with another assignment or assignments that together constitute an assignment of all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender. 

(vii) Certain Additional Payments . In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to such assignment shall make such additional payments to Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be 

134 

outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of Borrower and Administrative Agent, the applicable share of Syndicated Loans previously requested but not funded by such Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to: (A) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer, Swingline Lender or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (B) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its applicable share of all Syndicated Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph , then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Credit Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
 (c) Lender Group Joinder Agreement . Upon the Borrower s request, with the consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, an additional Lender Group may be added to this Credit Agreement at any time by the execution and delivery of a Lender Group Joinder Agreement by the members of such proposed additional Lender Group, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and, if applicable, the Lenders, which execution and delivery shall not be unreasonably refused by such parties. Upon receipt of (i) an executed Lender Group Joinder Agreement and (ii) a completed administrative questionnaire with respect to each member of such additional Lender Group, (A) each Person specified therein as a Conduit Lender shall become a party hereto as a Conduit Lender, entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Conduit Lender hereunder, (B) each Person specified therein as a Committed Lender shall become a party hereto as a Committed Lender, entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Committed Lender hereunder, (C) each Person specified therein as a Funding Agent shall become a party hereto as a Funding Agent, entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Funding Agent hereunder, (D) the Administrative Agent shall accept such Lender Group Joinder Agreement and record the information contained therein in the Register, (E) the Maximum Commitment shall be increased by an amount equal to the aggregate Commitments of the Committed Lenders party to such Lender Group Joinder Agreement and (F) Schedule 1.01A shall be deemed to be amended and supplemented to reflect such joinder. The Administrative Agent shall give each Funding Agent prompt notice of the addition of any Lender Group. 

(d) Effect of Assignment . Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by Administrative Agent pursuant to clause (e) of this Section 13.11 , from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Credit Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Credit Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits and obligations of Sections 4.01 , 4.04 , 4.05 and 13.06 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided , that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, each applicable Borrower Party (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the Funding Agent of the Assignee, if applicable, and the applicable existing Note or Notes shall be returned to the 

135 

Borrower, as applicable. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Credit Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Credit Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with clause (f) of this Section 13.11 . 
 (e) Register . Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower Parties (such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at Administrative Agent s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement and Lender Group Joinder Agreement delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Funding Agents, Lenders, and the Commitments of the Committed Lenders of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and Letter of Credit Liability owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each Borrower Party, Agents, the Swingline Lender and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Funding Agent or Lender hereunder, as the case may be, for all purposes of this Credit Agreement. In addition, Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation of any Committed Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower Parties, any Agent, the Swingline Lender and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Credit Agreement and for avoidance of doubt, each Lender Group with more than one (1) Conduit Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, assign to another Conduit Lender in its Lender Group all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder (including the outstanding Obligations and rights to payment of Principal Obligation and interest), as determined by the Administrative Agent from time to time. Each such assignment shall be recorded on the books and records of the Administrative Agent and the relevant Conduit Lenders, without the need to execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement. For all purposes of this Credit Agreement and all related documents, with respect to each assignment under this paragraph the relevant Conduit Lender shall be deemed to have the benefit of, and be subject to the obligations imposed by, an executed, delivered, accepted and recorded Assignment and Acceptance Agreement relating to such assignment. 
 (f) Participations . Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower Party, Funding Agent, Letter of Credit Issuer, Swingline Lender or Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person that is a Qualified Purchaser (other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender, a Disqualified Lender or a Borrower Party or any Affiliate or Subsidiary thereof) (each, a Participant in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and/or obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender s participations in Letter of Credit Liability and Swingline Loans) owing to it); provided that any Committed Lender may sell a participation in its rights and obligations hereunder only with the written consent of the Conduit Lender(s) in its Lender Group, and provided , further that: (i) such Lender s obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain unchanged; (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; and (iii) each Borrower Party, each Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Swingline Lenders and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 13.06(c) without regard to the existence of any participation. 

136 

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the second proviso of Section 13.01 that directly affects such Participant. Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.01 , 4.04 , and 4.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 13.11 (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 4.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 13.11 ; provided that such Participant: 
 (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 4.01 , 4.06 , 13.11 and 13.18 as if it were an assignee under clause (b) of this Section 13.11 ; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 4.01 or 4.05 with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 4.06 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 13.02 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 13.03 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register ); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations and Section 1.163 5(b) of the Proposed United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Credit Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
 (g) Certain Pledges . Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment or grant of a security interest to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, central bank or a collateral trustee or security agent for holders of commercial paper without notice to, or consent from, any Borrower Party or the Administrative Agent; provided that no such pledge or assignment or grant of a security interest shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee or grantee for such Lender as a party hereto. 

(h) Resignation as Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender after Assignment . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time PNC assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to Section 13.11(b) , PNC may, upon thirty (30) days notice to Borrower and Lenders, resign as Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender. In the event of any such resignation as Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender, Borrower shall be entitled to 

137 

appoint from among the Committed Lenders (subject to the consent of such Committed Lender in its sole discretion) a successor Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender hereunder; provided , however , that no failure by Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of PNC as Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be. If PNC resigns as Letter of Credit Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as Letter of Credit Issuer and all Letter of Credit Liability with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.08(c) ). If PNC resigns as Swingline Lender, it shall retain all of the rights of the Swingline Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swingline Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require Committed Lenders to make Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.07(c) . Upon the appointment of a successor Letter of Credit Issuer and/or Swingline Lender: (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Letter of Credit Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be; and (ii) the successor Letter of Credit Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to PNC to effectively assume the obligations of PNC with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
 (i) Certain Conduit Lender Provisions . Without limiting the foregoing, a Conduit Lender may, from time to time, with prior or concurrent notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in one (1) transaction or a series of transactions, assign all or a portion of its interest in the Principal Obligation and its rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement and any other Loan Documents to which it is a party to a Conduit Assignee. Upon and to the extent of such assignment by the Conduit Lender to a Conduit Assignee, (i) such Conduit Assignee shall become a Conduit Lender in the assigning Conduit Lender s Lender Group, with the Committed Lender and the Funding Agent in such Lender Group being the Committed Lender and Funding Agent, respectively, for such Conduit Assignee, (ii) such Conduit Assignee (as Conduit Lender) shall be the owner of the assigned portion of the Principal Obligation, (iii) the related administrator for such Conduit Assignee will act as the Administrator for such Conduit Assignee, with all corresponding rights and powers, express or implied, granted to an Administrator hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, (iv) such Conduit Assignee, any Related Commercial Paper Issuer, if such Conduit Assignee does not itself issue commercial paper, and their respective Liquidity Provider(s) and other Related Parties shall have the benefit of all the rights and protections provided to the Conduit Lender and its Liquidity Provider(s) herein and in the other Loan Documents (including any limitation on recourse against such Conduit Assignee or Related Parties, any agreement not to file or join in the filing of a petition to commence an insolvency proceeding against such Conduit Assignee, and the right to assign to another Conduit Assignee as provided in this paragraph ), (v) such Conduit Assignee shall assume all (or the assigned or assumed portion) of the Conduit Lender s obligations, if any, hereunder or any other Loan Document, and the Conduit Lender shall be released from such obligations, in each case to the extent of such assignment, and the obligations of the Conduit Lender and such Conduit Assignee shall be several and not joint, (vi) all distributions in respect of the Principal Obligation assigned shall be made to the applicable Funding Agent, on behalf of the Conduit Lender and such Conduit Assignee on a pro rata basis according to their respective interests, (vii) the definition of the term CP Rate with respect to the portion of the Principal Obligation funded with Commercial Paper issued by the Conduit Lender from time to time shall be determined in the manner set forth in the definition of CP Rate applicable to the Conduit Lender on the basis of the interest rate or discount applicable to Commercial Paper issued by such Conduit Assignee rather than the original Conduit Lender, (viii) the defined terms and other terms and provisions of this Credit Agreement and the 

138 

other Loan Documents shall be interpreted in accordance with the foregoing, and (ix) if requested by the Funding Agent or Administrator with respect to the Conduit Assignee, the parties will execute and deliver such further agreements and documents and take such other actions as such Funding Agent or Administrator may reasonably request to evidence and give effect to the foregoing. No such assignment shall be made to a Conduit Assignee unless the Commercial Paper of such Conduit Assignee shall have short-term credit ratings of A-1 and P-1 without the consent of Borrower. No assignment by a Conduit Lender to a Conduit Assignee of all or any portion of its interest in the Principal Obligation shall in any way diminish the obligation of the Committed Lenders in such Conduit Lender s Lender Group under Section 2.02 to fund any Loan not funded by the Conduit Lender or such Conduit Assignee or to acquire from the Conduit Lender or such Conduit Assignee all or any portion of its interest in the Principal Obligation pursuant this Section 13.11(b)(i) . 
 (j) Certain Committed Lender Provisions . In the event that a Conduit Lender makes an assignment to a Conduit Assignee in accordance with clause (i) above, the Committed Lenders in such Conduit Lender s Lender Group: (i) if requested by the related Administrator, shall terminate their participation in the applicable Liquidity Agreement to the extent of such assignment and shall execute (either directly or through a participation agreement, as determined by such Administrator) the liquidity agreement related to such Conduit Assignee, to the extent of such assignment, the terms of which shall be substantially similar to those of the participation or other agreement entered into by such Committed Lender with respect to the applicable Liquidity Agreement (or which shall be otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the related Administrator), (ii) if requested by such Conduit Lender, shall enter into such agreements as requested by such Conduit Lender pursuant to which they shall be obligated to provide funding to such Conduit Assignee on the same terms and conditions as is provided for in this Credit Agreement in respect of such Conduit Lender (or which agreements shall be otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and such Conduit Lender), and (iii) shall take such actions as the related Administrator shall reasonably request in connection therewith. 

13.12 Assignment to Committed Lenders . 

(a) Assignment Amounts . At any time on or prior to the Stated Maturity Date, if the Administrator on behalf of the applicable Conduit Lender so elects, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and such Conduit Lender s Funding Agent, such Conduit Lender hereby assigns effective on the Assignment Date referred to below all or such portions as may be elected by such Conduit Lender of its interest in the Principal Obligation at such time to its Committed Lenders pursuant to this Section 13.12 ; provided , however , that unless such assignment is an assignment of all such Conduit Lender s interest in the Principal Obligation in whole on or after its Conduit Investment Termination Date, no such assignment shall take place pursuant to this Section 13.12 if an Event of Default shall then exist; and provided , further , that no such assignment shall take place pursuant to this Section 13.12 at a time when such Conduit Lender is subject to any proceedings under any Debtor Relief Laws. No further documentation or action on the part of such Conduit Lender, the Borrower, or the applicable Committed Lenders shall be required to exercise the rights set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, other than the giving of the notice by the related Administrator on behalf of such Conduit Lender referred to in such sentence and the delivery by such Conduit Lender s Funding Agent of a copy of such notice to each Committed Lender in the Lender Group (the date of the receipt by the Administrative Agent of any such notice being the Assignment Date ). Each Committed Lender hereby agrees, unconditionally and irrevocably and under all circumstances, without set-off, counterclaim or defense of any kind, to pay the full amount of its Assignment Amount on such Assignment Date to such Conduit Lender in immediately available funds in Dollars based on the assigning Conduit Lender s interest in the 

139 

Principal Obligation, to an account designated by such Conduit Lender s Funding Agent. Upon payment of its Assignment Amount, each such Committed Lender shall acquire an interest in the Principal Obligation equal to its Committed Lender Percentage thereof. Upon any assignment in whole by a Conduit Lender to its Committed Lenders on or after its Conduit Investment Termination Date as contemplated hereunder, such Conduit Lender shall cease to make any additional Loans hereunder. At all times prior to its Conduit Investment Termination Date, nothing herein shall prevent a Conduit Lender from making a subsequent Loan hereunder, in its sole discretion, following any assignment pursuant to this Section 13.12 or from making more than one (1) assignment pursuant to this Section 13.12 . 
 (b) Additional Assignment Amounts . The applicable Borrower Party may pay to Administrative Agent in Dollars, for the account of each Conduit Lender s Funding Agent for the benefit of such Conduit Lender, in connection with any assignment by such Conduit Lender to its Committed Lenders pursuant to this Section 13.12 , an aggregate amount equal to all interest to accrue through the end of the current Interest Period to the extent attributable to the portion of the Loans so assigned to the Committed Lenders (as determined immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment), plus all Obligations then due, other than the Loans and other than any interest described above, attributable to such portion of the Loans so assigned. If the applicable Borrower Party does not make payment of such amounts at or prior to the time of assignment by a Conduit Lender to its Committed Lenders, such amount shall be paid by such Committed Lenders to the Conduit Lender as additional consideration for the interests assigned to the Committed Lenders and, except to the extent the applicable Borrower Party makes payment of such amounts to the Committed Lender when due, the amount of the Loans hereunder held by such Committed Lenders shall be increased by an amount equal to the additional amount so paid by such Committed Lenders. 

(c) Administration of Agreement after Assignment from Conduit Lender to Committed Lenders following the Conduit Investment Termination Date . After any assignment in whole by a Conduit Lender to its Committed Lenders pursuant to this Section 13.12 at any time on or after its Conduit Investment Termination Date (and the payment of all amounts owing to such Conduit Lender in connection therewith), all rights of the related Administrator set forth herein shall be given to the applicable Funding Agent on behalf of its Committed Lenders instead of such Administrator. 

(d) Payments to Administrative Agent . After any assignment in whole by a Conduit Lender to its Committed Lenders pursuant to this Section 13.12 at any time on or after its Conduit Investment Termination Date, all payments to be made hereunder by a Borrower Party to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of such Conduit Lender shall be made to the account specified by the applicable Funding Agent in writing to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower Party. 

(e) Recovery of Loans . In the event that the aggregate of the Assignment Amounts paid by the Committed Lenders with respect to any Lender Group pursuant to this Section 13.12 on any Assignment Date occurring on or after the Conduit Investment Termination Date for the related Conduit Lender is less than the Loans of such Conduit Lender on such Assignment Date, then to the extent that payments or deposits thereafter received and applied by the Administrative Agent with respect to such Lender Group under Section 3.03 in respect of Loans exceed the aggregate of the unrecovered Assignment Amounts and Loans funded by such Committed Lenders, such excess shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to such Conduit Lender s Funding Agent for the benefit of such Conduit Lender.

13.13 Replacement of Funding Party or Lender Group . If any Borrower Party is entitled to replace a Funding Party pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.06 (in any such case, an Affected Funding Party ), then Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort: 

(a) by notice to the applicable Funding Party, and with the consent of the Administrative Agent and such Funding Party s Funding Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), elect to replace such Affected Funding Party as a Funding Party to this Credit Agreement with an Eligible Assignee procured by Borrower, provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, and provided , further that, concurrently with such replacement such Eligible Assignee shall agree to purchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to the Affected Funding Party pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement and to become a Funding Party for all purposes under this Credit Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Funding Party to be terminated as of such date. Any such Affected Funding Party shall assign its rights and interests hereunder (other than its existing rights to payment pursuant to Sections 4.01 and 4.04 ), such assignment to be effected in compliance with the requirements of Section 13.11 . In the event that such an assignment occurs, the Eligible Assignee: (i) if requested by the applicable Funding Agent, shall execute (either directly or through a participation agreement, as determined by the Funding Agent) a Liquidity Agreement related to the applicable Conduit Lender, to the extent of such assignment, the terms of which shall be substantially similar to those of the participation or other agreement by the assigning Committed Lender with respect to the applicable Liquidity Agreement (or which shall be otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Funding Agent); and (ii) shall take such actions as the Agents shall reasonably request in connection therewith. A Funding Party shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Funding Party or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply; and 

(b) by notice to each member of the applicable Funding Party s Lender Group, and with the consent of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), elect to replace the Affected Funding Party s Lender Group with a Lender Group procured by Borrower, provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, and provided , further that, concurrently with such replacement the Lenders in such replacement Lender Group shall agree to purchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to each Lender in the Affected Funding Party s Lender Group pursuant to one (1) or more Assignment and Assumption Agreements and to become a Funding Party for all purposes under this Credit Agreement and to assume all obligations of each Lender in the Affected Funding Party s Lender Group to be terminated as of such date. Each Lender in the Affected Funding Party s Lender Group shall assign its rights and interests hereunder, such assignment to be effected in compliance with the requirements of Section 13.11 . 

13.14 Maximum Rate . Regardless of any provision contained in any of the Loan Documents, Funding Party shall never be entitled to receive, collect or apply as interest on the Obligations any amount in excess of the Maximum Rate, and, in the event that Funding Party ever receive, collect or apply as interest any such excess, the amount which would be excessive interest shall be deemed to be a partial prepayment of principal and treated hereunder as such; and, if the principal amount of the Obligations is paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be paid to the applicable Borrower Party. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable under any specific contingency exceeds the Maximum Rate, each Borrower Party and Funding Party shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law: (a) characterize any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest; (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof; and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate and spread, in equal parts, the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the Obligations so that the interest rate does 

141 

not exceed the Maximum Rate; provided that , if the Obligations are paid and performed in full prior to the end of the full contemplated term thereof, and if the interest received for the actual period of existence thereof exceeds the Maximum Rate, each applicable Funding Party shall refund to the applicable Borrower Party the amount of such excess or credit the amount of such excess against the principal amount of the Obligations and, in such event, Funding Parties shall not be subject to any penalties provided by any laws for contracting for, charging, taking, reserving or receiving interest in excess of the Maximum Rate. As used herein, the term applicable law shall mean the law in effect as of the date hereof; provided , however , that in the event there is a change in the law which results in a higher permissible rate of interest, then the Loan Documents shall be governed by such new law as of its effective date. 
 13.15 Headings . Section headings are for convenience of reference only and shall in no way affect the interpretation of this Credit Agreement.

No delay or omission by the Secured Parties in exercising any right or power hereunder, or under any other writings executed by Assignor or Obligor as security for or in connection with the Obligations, shall impair any such right or power or be construed as a waiver thereof or any acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right or power of the Secured Parties hereunder or under such other writings. 

(r) Any notice, demand, request or other communication which any party hereto may be required or may desire to give hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered and deemed effective in accordance with Section 13.07 of the Credit Agreement.
