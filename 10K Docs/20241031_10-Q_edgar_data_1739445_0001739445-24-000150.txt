 billion in cash, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments. Stavola, which will be reported within the Construction Products segment, is an aggregates-led and vertically integrated construction materials company primarily serving the New York-New Jersey Metropolitan Statistical Area ("MSA") through its network of five hard rock natural aggregates quarries, twelve asphalt plants, and three recycled aggregates sites. We are currently in the process of finalizing the accounting for this transaction and expect to complete the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration in the fourth quarter of 2024. The acquisition was financed with a combination of a million issuance of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes that closed in August 2024 following the announcement of the acquisition and a million borrowing of a variable-rate secured term loan that closed on October 1, 2024 concurrent with the completion of the acquisition.

 million. With operations in Alabama, California, and Oklahoma, Ameron is included in our Engineered Structures segment. The acquisition was funded with million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. The acquisition was recorded as a business combination based on a preliminary valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair value using unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities ("Level 3" inputs). The preliminary valuation resulted in the recognition of, among others, million of property, plant, and equipment, million of customer relationships, million of inventory, million of technology, million of accounts receivable, million of trademarks and million of goodwill in our Engineered Structures segment. The goodwill acquired, which is tax-deductible, primarily relates to Ameron's market position and existing workforce. We expect to complete our purchase price allocation as soon as reasonably possible, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date. Adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation could be material, particularly with respect to our preliminary estimates of property, plant, and equipment, customer relationships, and technology. 
 2023 Acquisitions 
 In December 2023, we completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Lake Point Holdings, LLC and Lake Point Restoration LLC, (collectively "Lake Point") a Florida based natural aggregates business in our Construction Products segment, for a total purchase price of million. The acquisition was funded with million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. The acquisition was recorded as a business combination based on a valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair value using Level 3 inputs. The preliminary valuation resulted in the recognition of, among others, million of property, plant, and equipment, million of mineral reserves, million of permits, and million of goodwill in our Construction Products segment. We expect to complete our purchase price allocation as soon as reasonably possible, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date. Adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation could be material, particularly with respect to our preliminary estimates of mineral reserves, permits, and property, plant, and equipment. 
 In October 2023, we completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of a Phoenix, Arizona based recycled aggregates business and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of a Florida based recycled aggregates business in our Construction Products segment.

 Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. An entity is required to establish a fair value hierarchy that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values are listed below: 
 Level 1 This level is defined as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company s cash equivalents are instruments of the U.S. Treasury or highly-rated money market mutual funds. 
 Level 2 This level is defined as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Interest rate hedges are valued at exit prices obtained from each counterparty. See Note 7 Debt. 
 Level 3 This level is defined as unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Contingent consideration relates to estimated future payments expected from businesses previously acquired or sold. We estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration using a model appropriate for the structure of the contingent consideration, which may include discounted cash flow models, Monte Carlo simulations, or option pricing models. The fair values are sensitive to changes in the forecast of the performance metrics and in other metrics such as discount rates and volatility. The fair value is reassessed quarterly based on assumptions used in our latest projections.

 Revolving Credit Facility 
 In August 2023, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") to increase our revolving credit facility from million to million, extend the maturity date of our revolving credit facility from January 2, 2025 to August 23, 2028, and refinance and repay in full the remaining balance of the term loan then outstanding under our prior credit facility. 
 On August 15, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement") to, among other things, (i) increase our revolving credit facility from million to million, (ii) collateralize the amended revolving credit facility with substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors' personal property (with certain exceptions), (iii) make the applicable margin for revolving borrowings, letters of credit and the commitment fee rate be based on our consolidated net leverage ratio (permitting up to million of unrestricted cash to be netted from the calculation thereof), (iv) modify the margin for SOFR-based revolving borrowings and letters of credit to range from to per annum, (v) modify the margin for base rate revolving borrowings to range from to , (vi) modify the commitment fee that accrues on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility to range from to , and (vii) modify the maximum permitted leverage to include a net debt concept (permitting up to million of unrestricted cash to be netted from the calculation thereof), and to provide that such ratio shall be no greater than to 1.00 during the fourth quarter of 2024 and the next two fiscal quarters, to 1.00 for the next following two fiscal quarters, and to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter thereafter (however, this maximum permitted leverage ratio may be increased to to 1.00 for up to four fiscal quarters if a material acquisition is entered into). These amendments did not become effective until the closing of the Stavola acquisition on October 1, 2024. The amended revolving credit facility's maturity date of August 23, 2028 remains unchanged.

 million of outstanding loans borrowed under our revolving credit facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount of outstanding loans borrowed increased 80.0 million primarily due to million borrowed in April 2024 to fund, in part, the acquisition of Ameron, of which million was repaid during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, prior to the effectiveness of the Amended Credit Agreement, there were approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility that will expire in 2025, which left million available for borrowing. The majority of our letters of credit obligations support the Company s various insurance programs and generally renew by their terms each year. 
 The interest rate for revolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement are variable based on the daily simple or term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus 10-basis points, or an alternate base rate, in each case plus a margin for borrowing. A commitment fee accrues on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The margin for revolving borrowings and commitment fee rate are determined based on the Company s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as measured by a consolidated funded indebtedness, less the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash up to a maximum amount not to exceed million, to consolidated EBITDA ratio). As of September 30, 2024, prior to the effectiveness of the Amended Credit Agreement, the margin for borrowing based on SOFR was set at and the commitment fee rate was set at . 
 The revolving credit facility portion of the Amended Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of certain ratios related to leverage and interest coverage. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company. On October 1, 2024, we collateralized our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement with substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors' personal property (with certain exceptions). 
 The carrying value of revolving borrowings under the Credit Agreement approximates fair value because the interest rate adjusts to the market interest rate (Level 3 input). See Note 3 Fair Value Accounting. 
 In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of approximately million. As of September 30, 2024, total unamortized debt issuance costs related to the prior and amended revolving credit facilities were million. These costs are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are amortized into interest expense over the term of the Amended Credit Agreement. 
 Term Loan 
 The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a new secured term loan facility (the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of million. The Term Loan was funded on October 1, 2024 with the closing of the Stavola acquisition, of which million was used to pay down the Company's revolving credit facility. The Term Loan requires, among other things, (i) mandatory prepayments from excess cash flow on an annual basis, commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025, (ii) mandatory prepayments with proceeds of certain asset sales and debt issuances, and (iii) quarterly principal amortization payments in an amount equal to of the initial Term Loan. The Term Loan has a maturity date of October 1, 2031. The interest rate for the Term Loan is based on SOFR plus per year. The Term Loan is prepayable at any time without penalty, except, in the event of a voluntary repricing in the first six months after closing, in which case a premium in the amount of 1.0 of the initial Term Loan is payable. The Term Loan is guaranteed by the same subsidiaries of the Company, that guarantee our revolving credit facility, and the Term Loan is secured on a pari passu basis with our revolving credit facility. 
 Senior Notes 
 On August 26, 2024, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the "2024 Notes") that mature in August 2032. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semiannually in February and August. In April 2021, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the "2021 Notes", and together with the 2024 Notes, the "Senior Notes") that mature in April 2029. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semiannually in April and October. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company s domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor under our Amended Credit Agreement. The terms of each indenture governing the Senior Notes, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and each of its subsidiaries to create liens on assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets and the assets of its subsidiaries. The terms of each indenture also limit the ability of the Company s non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur certain types of debt.

 In connection with the agreement to acquire Stavola, on August 1, 2024 the Company entered into a commitment letter with certain lenders to provide a senior secured 364-day bridge loan facility of up to billion for the purpose of providing the financing necessary to fund the acquisition. No funds were drawn upon the bridge loan facility, which terminated upon the closing of the Stavola acquisition. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred million of debt issuance costs related to the bridge loan facility, all of which is reflected in interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 Interest rate hedges 
 In December 2018, the Company entered into a million interest rate swap instrument, effective as of January 2, 2019, to reduce the effect of changes in the variable interest rates associated with the first million of borrowings under the Company's committed credit facility. In conjunction with the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR as a benchmark for borrowings under our credit facility, on July 1, 2023 the swap instrument transitioned from LIBOR to SOFR. The instrument effectively fixed the SOFR component of borrowings under our credit facility at a monthly rate of until such instrument's termination. The interest rate swap instrument expired in October 2023 and no new interest rate swap instrument has been entered into in connection with the Term Loan.

 Our MD A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Arcosa, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries Arcosa, Company, we, or our and related Notes in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K ). 

Company Overview 
 Arcosa, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a provider of infrastructure-related products and solutions with leading positions in construction, engineered structures, and transportation markets in North America. Arcosa is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in 2018 as an independent, publicly-traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Market Outlook 
 Within our Construction Products segment, market demand remains healthy overall when seasonal weather conditions have been normal, supported by increased infrastructure spending and private non-residential activity. The outlook for single-family residential housing continues to be impacted by higher interest rates and home affordability, which has negatively impacted volumes. We have been successful in managing inflationary cost pressures through proactive price increases. 
 Within our Engineered Structures segment, our backlog as of September 30, 2024 provides good production visibility for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. Our customers remain committed to taking delivery of these orders. In utility structures, order and inquiry activity continues to be healthy, as customers remain focused on grid hardening and reliability initiatives. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA") on August 16, 2022, which included a long-term extension of the Production Tax Credit for new wind farm projects and introduced new Advanced Manufacturing Production AMP tax credits for companies that domestically manufacture and sell clean energy equipment in the U.S., is a significant catalyst for our wind towers business. As demonstrated by more than 1.1 billion of new orders for delivery through 2028, which we have received since the passage of the IRA, our wind towers business is at the beginning stages of a market recovery. A large portion of these orders will support wind energy expansion projects in the Southwest. As a result, we have opened a new plant in New Mexico and started delivering towers from this facility late in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Within our Transportation Products segment, our backlog for inland barges as of September 30, 2024 was 244.7 million and extends into 2025. Our customers remain committed to taking delivery of these orders. Our barge business is recovering from cyclical lows resulting from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic when order levels fell sharply due to high steel prices throughout 2022 and 2023. Over this time, customer inquiries have remained healthy, initially for dry barges and more recently for tank barges. The fleet continues to age as new builds have not kept pace with scrapping, and utilization rates are high. We have been successful in filling orders when we can strategically source steel. During the third quarter, we received orders of 75 million for tank and hopper barges.

 Executive Overview 
 Recent Developments 
 In October 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of the construction materials business of Stavola Holding Corporation and its affiliated entities ("Stavola") for 1.2 billion in cash. Stavola, which will be reported within the Construction Products segment, serves the New York-New Jersey MSA through its network of five hard rock natural aggregates quarries, twelve asphalt plants, and three recycled aggregates sites. The purchase price was funded with a 700.0 million secured term loan facility (the Term Loan that matures in October 2031 and 600.0 million of 6.875 senior notes (the "2024 Notes") that matures in August 2032. 
 In August 2024, the Company completed the sale of its steel components business. Previously reported in the Transportation Products segment, the steel components business is a leading supplier of railcar coupling devices, railcar axles, and circular forgings. The total consideration for the divestiture was 110.0 million consisting of 55.0 million in cash, a 25.0 million seller's note and a 30.0 million earnout of which the estimated fair value as of September 30, 2024 was 14.1 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a loss of 23.0 million on the sale of the business which is reflected in (gain) loss on sale of businesses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 In April 2024, we completed the acquisition of Ameron Pole Products, LLC ("Ameron"), a leading manufacturer of highly engineered, premium concrete and steel poles for a broad range of infrastructure applications, including lighting, traffic, electric distribution, and small-cell telecom, for a total purchase price of 180.0 million. With operations in Alabama, California, and Oklahoma, Ameron is included in our Engineered Structures segment. The acquisition was funded with 160.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Arcosa s primary liquidity requirement consists of funding our business operations, including capital expenditures, working capital investment, and disciplined acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash flow from operations, our existing cash balance, availability under the revolving credit facility, and, as necessary, the issuance of additional long-term debt or equity. To the extent we have available liquidity, we may also consider undertaking new capital investment projects, executing additional strategic acquisitions, returning capital to stockholders, or funding other general corporate purposes. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Total cash provided by (required by): Operating activities 253.8 198.8 Investing activities (250.6) (131.5) Financing activities 648.8 (72.4) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 652.0 (5.1) 
 Operating Activities . Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 253.8 million, compared to 198.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The changes in current assets and liabilities resulted in a net source of cash of 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net use of cash of 43.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The current year activity was primarily driven by a net increase in liabilities and decreased inventories, partially offset by increased receivables. 
 Investing Activities. Net cash required by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 250.6 million, compared to 131.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 136.4 million, compared to 144.8 million for the same period last year. Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 180 to 195 million in 2024.

 Other Investing and Financing Activities 
 Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan, and Senior Notes 
 In August 2023, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ("the Credit Agreement") to increase our revolving credit facility from 500.0 million to 600.0 million, extend the maturity date of our revolving credit facility from January 2, 2025 to August 23, 2028, and refinance and repay in full the remaining balance of the term loan then outstanding under our prior credit facility. On August 15, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement") to, among other things, (i) increase our revolving credit facility from 600.0 million to 700.0 million, (ii) collateralize the amended revolving credit facility with substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors' personal property (with certain exceptions), (iii) make the applicable margin for revolving borrowings, letters of credit and the commitment fee rate be based on our consolidated net leverage ratio (permitting up to 150.0 million of unrestricted cash to be netted from the calculation thereof), (iv) modify the margin for SOFR-based revolving borrowings and letters of credit to range from 1.25 to 2.50 per annum, (v) modify the margin for base rate revolving borrowings to range from 0.25 to 1.50 , (vi) modify the commitment fee that accrues on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility to range from 0.20 to 0.45 , and (vii) modify the maximum permitted leverage to include a net debt concept (permitting up to 150.0 million of unrestricted cash to be netted from the calculation thereof), and to provide that such ratio shall be no greater than 5.00 to 1.00 during the fourth quarter of 2024 and the next two fiscal quarters, 4.50 to 1.00 for the next following two fiscal quarters, and 4.00 to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter thereafter (however, this maximum permitted leverage ratio may be increased to 4.50 to 1.00 for up to four fiscal quarters if a material acquisition is entered into). These amendments did not become effective until the closing of the Stavola acquisition on October 1, 2024. The amended revolving credit facility's maturity date of August 23, 2028 remains unchanged. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 240.0 million of outstanding loans borrowed under our revolving credit facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount of outstanding loans borrowed increased 80.0 million primarily due to 160.0 million borrowed in April 2024 to fund, in part, the acquisition of Ameron, of which 60.0 million was repaid during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, prior to the effectiveness of the Amended Credit Agreement, there were approximately 0.7 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility that will expire in 2025, which left 359.3 million available for borrowing. The majority of our letters of credit obligations support the Company s various insurance programs and generally renew by their terms each year. 
 The interest rate for revolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement are variable based on the daily simple or term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus 10-basis points, or an alternate base rate, in each case plus a margin for borrowing. A commitment fee accrues on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The margin for revolving borrowings and commitment fee rate are determined based on the Company s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as measured by a consolidated funded indebtedness, less the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash up to a maximum amount not to exceed 150.0 million, to consolidated EBITDA ratio). As of September 30, 2024, prior to the effectiveness of the Amended Credit Agreement, the margin for borrowing based on SOFR was set at 1.50 and the commitment fee rate was set at 0.25 . 
 The revolving credit facility portion of the Amended Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of certain ratios related to leverage and interest coverage. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company. On October 1, 2024, we collateralized our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement with substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors' personal property (with certain exceptions).

 The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a new secured term loan facility (the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of 700.0 million. The Term Loan was funded on October 1, 2024 with the closing of the Stavola acquisition. The Term Loan requires, among other things (i) mandatory prepayments from excess cash flow on an annual basis, commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025, (ii) mandatory prepayments with proceeds of certain asset sales and debt issuances, and (iii) quarterly principal amortization payments in an amount equal to 0.25 of the initial Term Loan. The Term Loan has a maturity date of October 1, 2031. The interest rate for the Term Loan is based on SOFR plus 2.25 per year. The Term Loan is prepayable at any time without penalty, except in the event of a voluntary repricing in the first six months after closing, in which case a premium in the amount of 1.0 of the initial Term Loan is payable. The Term Loan is guaranteed by the same subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee our revolving credit facility, and the Term Loan is secured on a pari passu basis with our revolving credit facility. 
 On August 26, 2024, the Company issued 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875 senior notes (the "2024 Notes") that mature in August 2032. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semiannually in February and August. In April 2021, the Company issued 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375 senior unsecured notes (the "2021 Notes", and together with the 2024 Notes, the "Senior Notes") that mature in April 2029. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semiannually in April and October. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company s domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor under our Amended Revolving Credit Facility. The terms of each indenture governing the Senior Notes, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and each of its subsidiaries to create liens on assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets and the assets of its subsidiaries. The terms of each indenture also limit the ability of the Company s non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur certain types of debt. 
 We believe, based on our current business plans, that our existing cash, available liquidity, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures and operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future. 
 Dividends and Repurchase Program 
 In September 2024, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.05 per share that is scheduled to be paid on October 31, 2024. 
 In December 2022, the Board authorized a new 50.0 million share repurchase program effective January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024 to replace a program of the same amount that expired on December 31, 2022. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a remaining authorization of 36.2 million under the program.

The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article 9 except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by reason of such failure. 
 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of such Third-Party Claim, to assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim (i) for which any portion of the relief sought is an injunction, restraining order or specific performance, or (ii) which relates to any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation.

If any recovery from a third party (including any net insurance recovery other than from the RWI Policy) is realized by an Indemnified Party within a eighteen (18)-month period after having previously received indemnification proceeds under Section 9.2 , such Indemnified Party will promptly tender to the respective Indemnifying Party an amount equal to such recovery from a third party (including any insurance recovery other than from the RWI Policy), not to exceed the amount of the indemnification proceeds paid by the Indemnifying Party. 
 (e) Any indemnification amount that is agreed or determined to be due and owing to the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall be effected solely by, and the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties under Section 9.2(a) shall be, a release of funds held in the Indemnity Escrow Account, to the extent available (in which case, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall promptly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver the amount owed, to the extent of remaining funds, to the Buyer).

The Sellers Representative shall deliver to the Buyer a true and correct copy of contents of the Data Room on a USB drive or other electronic means as soon as reasonably practical (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) following the Closing. 
 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the RWI Policy is not a condition for the Buyer to proceed to Closing, and the Buyer shall remain obligated, subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 , to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement regardless of whether the RWI Policy becomes effective. The absence of coverage under the RWI Policy or the failure of the RWI Policy to be in full force and effect for any reason shall not expand, alter, amend, change, or otherwise affect the liability of any Seller, any Founder, or any other Seller Indemnified Party under this Agreement.
