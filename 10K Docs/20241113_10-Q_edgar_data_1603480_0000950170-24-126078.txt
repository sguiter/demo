 an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies; 

a contraction of available credit could impair our ability to obtain leverage;

our future operating results; 

the prospects of our portfolio companies; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their financial and other business objectives; 

the increasing concentration of our investment portfolio as we continue to wind down may heighten the risk that an adverse change in one issuer or industry could have a material adverse impact on our performance;

the speculative and illiquid nature of our investments; 

the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments;

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, some of those assumptions are based on the work of third parties and any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate; as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could prove to be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, except as required by applicable law. The safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the 1934 Act ), which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this report because we are an investment company. 
 Overview 
 We were formed on April 1, 2014 as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware. We have filed an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have also elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under the Code for the taxable year ending December 31, 2015 and subsequent years. We are required to continue to meet the minimum distribution and other requirements for RIC qualification. As such, we are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets, source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income and tax-exempt interest. 
 Each investor was required to enter into a subscription agreement in connection with its Commitment (a Subscription Agreement ). Under the terms of the subscription agreements, the Company may generally draw down all or any portion of the undrawn commitment with respect to each Common Unit upon at least ten business days prior written notice to the Common Unitholders. Investors have entered into subscription agreements for 20,134,698 Common Units of the Company issued and outstanding representing a total of 2.013 billion of committed capital. On July 11, 2022 our Members approved a reduction in Undrawn Commitments by 10.43 per unit, resulting in an approximately 41.18 reduction of overall remaining available capital commitments. We effected this commitment reduction by reducing the number of outstanding undrawn units and thereby reducing total Units from 20,134,698 to 18,034,649. Such Unit reduction was proportionately effected for each Member and therefore has no impact on each Member s percentage interest in us. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have two wholly-owned subsidiaries, each of which is a Delaware limited liability company designed to hold an equity investment of ours. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income and capital appreciation by providing private capital to middle market companies operating in a broad range of industries primarily in the United States. As our investment period has ended, we will not originate new loans, but may increase credit facilities to existing borrowers or affiliates. Our highly negotiated private investments may include senior secured loans, unsecured senior loans, subordinated and mezzanine loans, convertible securities, equity securities, and equity-linked securities such as options and warrants. However, our investment bias has been towards adjustable-rate, senior secured loans. We do not anticipate a secondary market developing for our private investments. The investment philosophy, strategy and approach of the private credit team of the Adviser (the Private Credit Team fka the Direct Lending Team has generally not involved the use of payment-in-kind PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, or similar arrangements. Although the Private Credit Team generally did not originate a significant amount of investments for us with PIK interest features, the majority of our current investments do contain PIK due to certain circumstances involving debt restructurings or work-outs. The high concentration of PIK in our current portfolio is primarily a result of the continued wind down of our portfolio. 
 We are primarily focused on investing in senior secured debt obligations, although there may be occasions where the investment may be unsecured. We also consider an equity investment as the primary security, in combination with a debt obligation, or as a part of total return strategy. Our investments are mostly in corporations, partnerships or other business entities. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we may co-invest with other investors and/or strategic partners through indirect investments in portfolio companies through a joint venture vehicle, partnership or other special purpose vehicle (each, an Investment Vehicle ). While we invest primarily in U.S. companies, there are certain instances where we invested in companies domiciled elsewhere. 
 Expenses 
 We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided through the Administration Agreement and the Advisory Agreement. 
 35 

We will bear (including by reimbursing the Adviser or Administrator) all costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, without limitation, organizational and offering expenses, management fees, costs of reporting required under applicable securities laws, legal fees of our counsel and accounting fees. However, we will not bear (a) more than an amount equal to 10 basis points of the aggregate Commitments for organization and offering expenses in connection with the offering of Common Units through the Closing Period and (b) more than an amount equal to 12.5 basis points of the aggregate Commitments per annum (pro-rated for partial years) for our Operating Expenses, including amounts paid to the Administrator under the Administration Agreement and reimbursement of expenses to the Adviser and its affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cap on Operating Expenses does not apply to payments of the Management Fee, Incentive Fee, organizational and offering expenses (which are subject to the separate cap described above), amounts payable in connection with our borrowings (including interest, bank fees, legal fees and other transactional expenses related to any borrowing or borrowing facility and similar costs), costs and expenses relating to our liquidation of the Company, taxes, or extraordinary expenses (such as litigation expenses and indemnification payments to either the Adviser or the Administrator). All expenses that we will not bear will be borne by the Adviser or its affiliates. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Investments which we hold for which market quotes are not readily available or are not considered reliable are valued at fair value according to procedures approved by our Board of Directors (the Board based on similar instruments, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Adviser as the "valuation designee" with respect to the fair valuation of the Company's portfolio securities, subject to oversight by and periodic reporting to the Board. 
 Fair Value Hierarchy: Assets and liabilities are classified by us into three levels based on valuation inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets. 
 Level 2 values are based on significant observable market inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets and quoted prices in inactive markets or other market observable inputs. 
 Level 3 values are based on significant unobservable inputs that reflect our determination of assumptions that market participants might reasonably use in valuing the assets. 
 Categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. 
 Level 1 Assets (Investments): The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows: 
 Equity, (Level 1), includes common stock valued at the closing price on the primary exchange in which the security trades. 
 Level 3 Assets (Investments): The following valuation techniques and significant inputs are used to determine the fair value of investments in private debt for which reliable market quotations are not available. Some of the inputs are independently observable; however, a significant portion of the inputs and the internal assumptions applied are unobservable. 
 Debt, (Level 3), include investments in privately originated senior secured debt. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. An income method approach incorporating a weighted average cost of capital and discount rate or a market method approach using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets are generally used to determine fair value, though some cases use an enterprise value waterfall method. Valuation may also include a shadow rating method. Standard pricing inputs include but are not limited to the financial health of the issuer, place in the capital structure, value of other issuer debt, credit, industry, and market risk and events. 
 Equity, (Level 3), includes common stock, preferred stock and warrants. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A market approach is generally used to determine fair value. Pricing inputs include, but are not limited to, financial health and relevant business developments of the issuer; EBITDA; market multiples of comparable companies; comparable market transactions and recent trades or transactions; issuer, industry and market events; and contractual or legal restrictions on the sale of the security. A liquidity discount based on current market expectations, future events, minority ownership position and the period management reasonably expects to hold the investment may be applied. 
 Net Asset Value NAV (Investment Funds and Vehicles): Equity investments in affiliated investment fund (TCW Strategic Ventures) are valued based on the net asset value reported by the investment fund. Investments held by the affiliated fund include debt investments in privately originated senior secured debt. Such investments held by the affiliated fund are valued using the 
 36 

same methods, approach and standards applied above to debt investments held by the Company. The Company s ability to withdraw from the fund is subject to restrictions. The term of the fund will continue until June 5, 2021 unless dissolved earlier or extended for two additional one-year periods by the Company, in its full discretion. The Company can further extend the term of the fund for additional one-year periods, upon notice to and consent from the funds management committee. On February 25, 2021, Company extended the fund s term one additional year, until June 5, 2022. On February 1, 2022, the Company further extended the fund's term one additional year, until June 5, 2023. On April 17, 2023, the Company further extended the fund's term one additional year, until June 5, 2024. On May 1, 2024, the Company further extended the fund's term one additional year, until June 5, 2025. The Company is entitled to income and principal distributed by the fund.

 As of December 31, 2023, our portfolio consisted of debt and equity investments in seven and six portfolio companies, respectively, including TCW Strategic Ventures. Based on fair values as of December 31, 2023, our portfolio was comprised of 62.5 debt investments which were primarily senior secured, first lien term loans and 37.5 equity investments, which were primarily common and preferred stocks; warrants; and our common and preferred membership interests in TCW Strategic Ventures. Debt investments in three portfolio companies were on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2023, representing 4.3 and 22.6 of our portfolio s fair value and cost, respectively.

Total investment income 
 Total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4.7 million and 12.1 million, respectively, and included interest income (including interest income paid-in-kind) of 4.7 million and 11.2 million, respectively. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included 2.5 million and 4.1 million, respectively, of interest income paid-in-kind. Total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 also included 0 and 0.8 million, respectively, of dividend income from our investment in TCW Direct Lending Strategic Ventures. 
 Total investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 26.3 million and 41.0 million, respectively, and included interest income (including interest income paid-in-kind) of 21.4 million and 33.6 million, respectively. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included 14.1 million and 11.4 million, respectively, of interest income paid-in-kind. Total investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 also included 4.8 million and 7.0 million, respectively, of dividend income from our investment in TCW Direct Lending Strategic Ventures. 
 Total investment income decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the decrease in dividend income from TCW Direct Lending Strategic Ventures during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 coupled with a decrease in interest income. Interest income decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the H-D Advanced Manufacturing Company term loan being reorganized into a term loan with Overton Chicago Gear, LLC and Class A units of Precision Products Machining Group, LLC during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The equitization of a portion of the H-D term loan and a lower interest rate on the Overton Chicago Gear, LLC term loan reduced accrued interest for the period. In addition, the Pace Industries, Inc. revolver was placed into non-accrual status during the three months ended September 30, 2024 which reduced accrued interest on the loan. 
 Net investment income 
 Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.7 million and 8.6 million, respectively. Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 14.6 million and 29.2 million, respectively. 
 The decrease in net investment income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to the decrease in total investment income as described above, coupled with higher net expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in net investment income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in total investment income as described above, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Our net expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4.0 million and 3.6 million, respectively. Our net expenses included management fees attributed to the Adviser of 0.9 million and 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were waived by the Adviser subsequent to December 31, 2022. 
 
 38 

Our net expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 11.7 million and 11.8 million, respectively. Our net expenses included management fees attributed to the Adviser of 2.7 million and 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were waived by the Adviser subsequent to December 31, 2022. 
 The increase in net operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to higher interest and credit facility expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in amortization of deferred financing costs from the debt amendment that occurred after the three months ended September 30, 2023 as well as an increase in interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024 . In addition, there was also an increase in interest expense on repurchase transactions due to increases in interest rates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in net operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to lower interest and credit facility expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease in our weighted averaging outstanding credit facility balance. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest expense on repurchase transactions due to increases in interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net realized loss on investments 
 
 Our net realized loss on investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.0 million and 5.0 million, respectively. Our realized loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was entirely due to our disposition of the H-D Advanced Manufacturing Company term loan. 
 
 Our net realized loss on investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 0 and 2.0 million, respectively. We did not have a net realized loss on investments during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as no investments were disposed of during the period. Our net loss on investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was entirely due to our disposition of our revolver and preferred equity from Guardia LLC. 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on investments 
 Our net change in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 41.6) million and 2.7) million, respectively.

 The Net decrease in Members Capital from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Net increase in Members' Capital from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to net realized and unrealized losses on our investments of 89.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 coupled with an decrease in net investment income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as described above. 
 Direct Lending Strategic Ventures LLC 
 On June 5, 2015, the Company, together with an affiliate of Security Benefit Corporation and accounts managed by Oak Hill Advisors, L.P., entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the Agreement to become members of TCW Strategic Ventures. TCW Strategic Ventures focuses primarily on making senior secured floating rate loans to middle-market borrowers. The Agreement was effective June 5, 2015. The Company s capital commitment is 481.6 million, representing approximately 80 of the preferred and common equity ownership of TCW Strategic Ventures, with the third-party investors representing the remaining capital commitments and preferred and common equity ownership. A portion of the Company s capital commitment was satisfied by the contribution of two loans to TCW Strategic Ventures. TCW Strategic Ventures also entered into a revolving credit facility to finance a portion of certain eligible investments on June 5, 2015. The revolving credit facility is for up to 600 million. TCW Strategic Ventures is managed by a management committee comprised of two members, one appointed by the Company and one appointed by Oak Hill Advisors, L.P. All decisions of the management committee require unanimous approval of its members. Neither the Company, nor the Adviser will receive management fees from this entity. Although the Company owns more than 25 of the voting securities of TCW Strategic Ventures, the Company does not believe that it has control over TCW Strategic Ventures (other than for purposes of the 1940 Act). The Company s ability to withdraw from the fund is subject to restrictions. 
 On April 30, 2021, TCW Strategic Ventures revolving credit facility was terminated. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 On March 19, 2015 we completed the final private placement of Common Units. We generate cash from (1) drawing down capital in respect of Common Units, (2) cash flows from investments and operations and (3) borrowings from banks or other lenders. 
 Our primary use of cash is for (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (2) the cost of operations (including expenses, management fees, incentive fees, and any indemnification obligations), (3) debt service of any borrowings and (4) cash distributions to the Common Unitholders.

Natixis Credit Agreement 
 We have a secured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with Natixis, New York Branch Natixis as administrative agent and committed lender. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit line of up to 750 million (the Maximum Commitment (the Credit Facility ), subject to the lesser of the Borrowing Base assets or the Maximum Commitment (the Available Commitment ). The Borrowing Base assets generally equal the sum of (a) a percentage of certain eligible investments in a controlled account, (b) a percentage of unfunded commitments from certain eligible investors in the Company and (c) cash in a controlled account. The Credit Agreement is generally secured by the Borrowing Base assets. 
 On April 10, 2017, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement. Under the April 10, 2017 Credit Agreement borrowings bear interest at a rate equal to either the (a) adjusted eurodollar rate calculated in a customary manner plus 2.35 , (b) commercial paper rate plus 2.35 , or (c) a base rate calculated in a customary manner (using the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 , the Prime Rate and the Floating LIBOR Rate plus 1.00 plus 1.35 . Moreover, the Credit Agreement s stated maturity date was extended from November 10, 2017 to April 10, 2020. 
 On April 6, 2020, we entered into a First Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement ), with Natixis, New York Branch, as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit line of up to 375.0 million (with an option for us to increase this amount to 450.0 million subject to consent of the lenders and satisfaction of certain other conditions), subject to the available borrowing base, which is generally the sum of (a) a percentage of certain eligible investments, (b) a percentage of remaining unfunded commitments from certain eligible investors in the Company and (c) cash in a controlled account. The Amended Credit Agreement is generally secured by the unfunded commitments (together with the recallable amounts) of our investors, portfolio investments and substantially all other assets of the Company. The stated maturity date of the Amended Credit Agreement was April 9, 2021, which date (subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions) could have been extended by the Company for up to an additional 364 days. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement bore interest at a rate equal to either (a) adjusted eurodollar rate calculated in a customary manner plus 2.50 , (b) commercial paper rate plus 2.50 , or (c) a base rate calculated in a customary manner (which will never be less than the adjusted eurodollar rate plus 1.00 plus 1.50 , provided however in each case the commercial paper rate and the eurocurrency rate shall have a floor of 1.00 . 
 On May 27, 2020, we entered into a Lender Group Joinder Agreement pursuant to which Zions Bancorporation, N.A. d/b/a California Bank Trust was added as a committed lender (with a commitment of 25.0 million) under the Amended Credit Agreement. Concurrently therewith, we elected to increase the size of our revolving credit line under the Credit Agreement to 400.0 million. On December 29, 2020, we elected to permanently decrease the size of our revolving credit line under the Credit Agreement to 177.0 million. 
 On April 6, 2021, we entered into a Third Amendment to the Amended Credit Agreement (the Third Amended Credit Agreement ). The Third Amended Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit line of up to 177.0 million subject to the available borrowing base, which is generally a percentage of remaining unfunded commitments from certain eligible investors in the Company. The Third Amended Credit Agreement is generally secured by the unfunded commitments (together with the recallable amounts) of the Company s investors. The stated maturity date of the Third Amended Credit Agreement is April 8, 2022, which (subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions) may be extended by us for up to an additional 364 days. On March 23, 2022, we exercised our final extension option, and extended the maturity date of the Third Amended Credit Agreement to April 7, 2023. Borrowings under the Third Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to either (a) Eurocurrency Rate calculated in a customary manner plus 1.95 , (b) commercial paper CP rate plus 1.95 , or (c) a base rate calculated in a customary manner (which will never be less than the adjusted Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00 plus 0.95 , provided however in each case the CP Rate and the Eurocurrency Rate shall have a floor of 0.00 . The Credit Facility may be terminated, and any outstanding amounts thereunder may become due and payable, should the Company fail to satisfy certain covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with such covenants. 
 42 

On January 10, 2023, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Fourth Amended Credit Agreement"). The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement replaces the Eurocurrency Rate with a Daily Simple SOFR Rate, Term SOFR Rate and Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (each as defined in the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement) for purposes of calculating interest on the loan. Each Term SOFR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for such Interest Period plus the interest rate spread or "Applicable Margin." Each Daily SOFR Loan will bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus the Applicable Margin. The Term SOFR Loan and Daily SOFR Loan have an Applicable Margin of 1.95 . 
 On April 7, 2023, we entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Fifth Amended Credit Agreement"). The Fifth Amended Credit Agreement removed the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for purposes of calculating interest on the loan but kept the Daily Simple SOFR and Term SOFR rates as is. It also updated the Applicable Margin from 0.95 to 1.15 for Base Rate Loans and from 1.95 to 2.15 for all other loan types. The revolving credit line was also reduced from 177.0 million to 152.0 million and lastly, the maturity date of the loan was extended 364 days to April 5, 2024. 
 On April 5, 2024, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Sixth Amended Credit Agreement"). The Sixth Amended Credit Agreement updated the Applicable Margin from 1.15 to 1.50 for Base Rate Loans and from 2.15 to 2.50 for all other loan types. The maturity date of the loan was also extended 364 days to April 4, 2025. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Available Commitment under the Credit Facility was 65.6 million and 75.0 million, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility were 86.5 million and 77.1 million, respectively. The carrying amount of the Credit Facility, which is categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximates its fair value. Valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value include Company details, credit, market and liquidity risk and events, financial health of the Company, place in the capital structure, interest rate and terms and conditions of the Credit Facility. 
 Costs associated with the Credit Facility are recorded as deferred financing costs on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and the costs are being amortized over the life of the Credit Facility. We incurred financing costs of 0.9 million and 0.5 million in connection with the April 6, 2021 Third Amended Credit Agreement and the April 7, 2023 Fifth Amended Credit Agreement, respectively. We also incurred financing costs of 0.6 million in connection with the April 5, 2024 Sixth Amended Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 0.3 million and 0.1 million, respectively, of such prepaid deferred financing costs had yet to be amortized.

We may, from time to time, enter into repurchase agreements with Barclays Bank PLC Barclays ), whereby we sell to Barclays our short-term investments and concurrently enter into an agreement to repurchase the same investments at an agreed-upon price at a future date, generally within 30-days (the Repurchase Transaction ). 
 In accordance with ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing , these Repurchase Transactions meet the criteria for secured borrowings. Accordingly, the short-term investments remain on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as an asset, and we record a liability to reflect our repurchase obligation to Barclays (the Repurchase Obligation ). The Repurchase Obligation is secured by the short-term investments that are the subject of the repurchase agreement. 
 We had no outstanding Repurchase Obligations as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. Interest expense incurred under these Repurchase Transactions was 1.6 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company s total capital commitment to its underlying investment in Strategic Ventures is 481,600. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s unfunded commitment to Strategic Ventures was 219,646.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2024, 74.6 of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, such as SOFR. The interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to three months. At September 30, 2024, the percentage of our floating rate debt investments that bore interest based on an interest rate floor was 0.0 . Floating rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to three months only if the index exceeds the floor. 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. We assess our portfolio companies periodically to determine whether such companies will be able to continue making interest payments in the event that interest rates increase. There can be no assurances that the portfolio companies will be able to meet their contractual obligations at any or all levels of increases in interest rates. Based on our September 30, 2024 consolidated balance sheet, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income (excluding the related incentive compensation impact) of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure (dollar amounts in thousands):

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under loans to or other contracts with our portfolio companies. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Sales of unregistered securities 
 On September 19, 2014, the Company began accepting subscription agreements from investors for the private sale of its Common Units. The Company continued to enter into subscription agreements through the final closing date of March 19, 2015. Under the terms of the subscription agreements, the Company may generally draw down all or any portion of the undrawn commitment with respect to each Common Unit upon at least ten business days prior written notice to the Unitholders.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Fund is an investment company following the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 946 Financial Services Investment Companies. 
 Basis of Presentation: The Fund s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP for investment companies. 
 Use of Estimates: The preparation of the accompanying financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Investments: The Fund records investment transactions on the trade date. The Fund considers trade date for investments not traded on a recognizable exchange, or traded in the over-the-counter markets, to be the date on which the Fund receives legal or contractual title to the asset and bears the risk of loss. 
 Income Recognition: Interest, interest paid-in-kind and unused commitment fee income are recorded on an accrual basis unless doubtful of collection or the related investment is in default. Realized gains and losses on investments are recorded on a specific identification basis. Amendment, consent, waiver and forbearance fees received in exchange for a concession that result in a change in yield are recognized immediately when earned as interest income. The Fund typically receives a fee in the form of a discount to the purchase price at the time it funds an investment in a loan. The discount is accreted to interest income over the life of the respective loan, as reported in the Statement of Operations, and reflected in the amortized cost basis of the investment. Discounts associated with a revolver as well as fees associated with a delayed draw that remains unfunded are treated as a discount to the issuers term loan. Fee income received from the Adviser that the Adviser received from a portfolio company for services rendered, are recognized immediately as income. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Fund considers cash equivalents to be liquid investments, including money market funds or individual securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund are generally comprised of money market funds and demand deposits, valued at cost, which approximates fair value and are classified as Level 1 in the GAAP valuation hierarchy. 
 Income Taxes: The Fund is exempt from federal and state income taxes and, consequently, no income tax provision has been made in the accompanying financial statements. 
 11 

TCW Direct Lending Strategic Ventures LLC (A Delaware Limited Liability Company) 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(continued) 					 September 30, 2024 
 The Fund has invested in numerous jurisdictions and is therefore subject to varying policies and statutory time limitations with respect to examination of tax positions. The Fund reviews and evaluates tax positions in its major jurisdictions and determines whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition. 
 The Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as an income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. As of and during the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Fund did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits, nor did it recognize any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. 
 The Fund is subject to examination by U.S. federal tax authorities for returns filed for the prior three years and by state tax authorities for returns filed for the prior four years. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions ASU 2022-03 ). ASU 2022-03 (1) clarifies the guidance in ASC 820 on the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to a contractual sale restriction and (2) requires specific disclosures related to such an equity security. ASU 2022-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. On January 1, 2024, the Fund adopted ASU 2022-03 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the financial statements. 
 Subsequent Events: The Management Committee evaluated the activity of the Fund through November 13, 2024, the date that the financial statements are available to be issued, and have concluded that no other subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition or disclosure. 
 3. INVESTMENT VALUATIONS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Investments at Fair Value: Investments held by the Fund for which market quotes are readily available are valued at fair value. Fair value is generally determined on the basis of last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary exchange in which each security trades, or if no sales are reported, based on the midpoint of the valuation range obtained for debt investments from a quotation reporting system, established market makers or pricing service. Investments held by the Fund for which market quotes are not readily available or market quotations are not considered reliable are valued at fair value by the Management Committee based on similar instruments, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. 
 Fair Value Hierarchy: Assets and liabilities are classified by the Fund based on valuation inputs used to determine fair value into three levels. 
 Level 1 values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets. 
 Level 2 values are based on significant observable market inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets and quoted prices in inactive markets or other market observable inputs. 
 Level 3 values are based on significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Fund s determination of assumptions that market participants might reasonably use in valuing the assets. 
 Categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)(continued) 	 September 30, 2024 
 Level 3 Assets (Investments): The following valuation techniques and significant inputs are used to determine fair value of investments in private debt for which reliable market quotations are not available. Some of the inputs are independently observable however, a significant portion of the inputs and the internal assumptions applied are unobservable. 
 Debt , (Level 3), includes investments in privately originated senior secured debt. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A discounted cash flow approach incorporating a weighted average cost of capital is generally used to determine fair value or, in some cases, an enterprise value waterfall method. Valuation may also include a shadow rating method. Standard pricing inputs include but are not limited to the financial health of the issuer, place in the capital structure, value of other issuer debt, credit, industry, and market risk and events. 
 Equity , (Level 3), includes common stock, preferred stock and warrants. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A market approach is generally used to determine fair value. Pricing inputs include, but are not limited to, financial health, and relevant business developments of the issuer; EBITDA, market multiples of comparable companies, comparable market transactions and recent trades or transactions; issuer, industry and market events; contractual or legal restrictions on the sale of the security. When a Black-Scholes pricing model is used, the pricing model takes into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputs, including: time value, implied volatility, equity prices and interest rates. A liquidity discount based on current market expectations, future events, minority ownership position and the period management reasonably expects to hold the investment may be applied. 
 Pricing inputs and weightings applied to determine value require subjective determination. Accordingly, valuations do not necessarily represent the amounts that may eventually be realized from sales or other dispositions of investments. 
 The following table summarizes by major security type the valuation techniques and quantitative information utilized in determining the fair value of the Level 3 investments as of September 30, 2024.

 The Internal Rates of Return (IRR) since inception of the Members, after financing costs and other operating expenses are 11.8 and 12.3 through September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The IRR is computed based on cash flow due dates contained in notices to Members (contributions from and distributions to the Members) and the net assets (residual value) of the Members capital account at period end and is calculated for the Members taken as a whole. 
 The IRR is calculated based on the fair value of investments using principles and methods in accordance with GAAP and does not necessarily represent the amounts that may be realized from sales or other dispositions. Accordingly, the return may vary significantly upon realization.
