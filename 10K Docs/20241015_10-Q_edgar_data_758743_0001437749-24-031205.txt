ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and with the Company's 2024 Annual Report to Shareholders, which included audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024, as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview 

The Company designs, engineers, manufactures, markets, distributes and installs technologically advanced display products and systems, from basic components to turnkey systems, for government, military, aerospace, medical, industrial, and commercial organizations. The Company is comprised of one segment - the manufacturing and distribution of displays and display components. The Company is organized into two interrelated operations aggregated into one reportable segment. 

Simulation and Training Products offers a wide range of projection display systems for use in training and simulation, military, medical, entertainment and industrial applications. 

Cyber Secure Products offers advanced TEMPEST technology, and EMSEC products. This business also provides various contract services including the design and testing solutions for defense and niche commercial uses worldwide. 

During fiscal 2025, management of the Company is focusing key resources on strategic efforts to grow its business through internal sales of the Company s more profitable product lines and reduce expenses in all areas of the business to bring its cost structure in line with the current size of the business. Challenges facing the Company during these efforts include: 

Liquidity 

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company reported a net loss and a decrease in working capital for the six-month period ending August 31, 2024, primarily due to insufficient revenues in the Company. The Company also had an increase in liquid assets for the six month period primarily as a result of proceeds from loans from the Company s CEO, offset by negative cash flows from operations due to a lack of revenue. The Company has sustained losses for the last four of five fiscal years and has seen overall a decline in working capital and liquid assets during this five -year period. Annual losses over this time are due to a combination of decreasing revenues across the divisions without a commensurate reduction of expenses. The Company s working capital and liquid asset position are presented below (in thousands) as of August 31, 2024, and February 29, 2024:

These initiatives include enhancing sales and marketing efforts, targeting repeat business, and have hired an experienced Simulation Business Development Manager, increasing customer visits, participating in trade shows, and conducting email marketing campaigns to promote its product lines. 

In order, to assist funding operating activity, the Company s CEO loaned an additional 200 thousand to the company during the first six months of fiscal year 2025. There is no line of credit outstanding or other financing currently in place other than the note payable with the Company CEO with a balance of 2,343,918. There are no repayment terms related to the loan, however, the Company plans to repay the note within the next twelve months and therefore has classified the loan as a current liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of August 31, 2024. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of management s plans to improve revenues, the operational effectiveness of continuing operations, the procurement of suitable financing, or a combination of these. The uncertainty regarding the potential success of management s plan create substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

Inventory valuation Management regularly reviews the Company s investment in inventories for declines in value and writes down the cost when it is apparent that the expected net realizable value of the inventory falls below its carrying amount. The Company operates in an environment of constantly changing technologies and retains a certain amount of inventory for legacy products for maintenance and replacement capabilities for its customers. The Company maintains inventory on certain products to ensure it has adequate inventory to fulfill orders for transitioning product lines. Management reviews inventory levels on a quarterly basis. Such reviews include observations of product development trends of the original equipment manufacturers, new products being marketed, and technological advances relative to the product capabilities of the Company s existing inventories.

The Company also had an increase in liquid assets for the six month period primarily as a result of proceeds from loans from the Company s CEO, offset by negative cash flows from operations due to a lack of revenue. The Company has sustained losses for the last four of five fiscal years and has seen overall a decline in working capital and liquid assets during this five -year period. Annual losses over this time are due to a combination of decreasing revenues across the divisions without a commensurate reduction of expenses. The Company s working capital and liquid asset position are presented below (in thousands) as of August 31, 2024, and February 29, 2024:

Management continues to implement plans to improve liquidity and to increase revenues at all divisions. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of management s plans to improve revenues, the operational effectiveness of continuing operations, the procurement of suitable financing, or a combination of these. The uncertainty regarding the potential success of management s plan create substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

Cash used in operations for the six months ended August 31, 2024, was 0.1 million. Offsets to net losses of 0.3 million were 0.1 million for depreciation and amortization and 0.1 million for noncash lease cost. Changes in working capital were 0.1 million, primarily a decrease in contract liabilities of 0.5 million, a decrease in accounts payable of 0.2 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of 0.1 million, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of 0.4 million, a decrease in inventories of 0.4 million, and a decrease in contract assets of 0.1 million. 

Cash used in operations for the six months ended August 31, 2023, was 0.5 million. Adjustments to net losses of 0.1 million were 0.1 million for depreciation, 0.1 million for non-cash lease cost, and by 0.4 million for the loss from discontinued operations. Changes in working capital used 1.0 million, primarily an increase in accounts receivable of 1.3 million, an increase in inventory of 0.6 million, offset by an increase in contract liabilities of 0.4 million, an increase in accounts payable of 0.2 million, a decrease in contract assets of 0.2 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses of 0.1 million.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon the Company s interim condensed consolidated financial statements. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. The accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments, estimates, and complexity include reserves on inventories, revenue recognition, and the sufficiency of the valuation reserve related to deferred tax assets. The Company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates: 

Inventory Valuation 

Management regularly reviews the Company s investment in inventories for declines in value and writes down the cost when it is apparent that the expected net realizable value of the inventory falls below its carrying amount. The Company operates in an environment of constantly changing technologies and retains a certain amount of inventory for legacy products for maintenance and replacement capabilities for its customers. The Company maintains inventory on certain products to ensure it has adequate inventory to fulfill orders for transitioning product lines. Management reviews inventory levels on a quarterly basis. Such reviews include observations of product development trends of the original equipment manufacturers, new products being marketed, and technological advances relative to the product capabilities of the Company s existing inventories. 

Revenue Recognition 

We recognize revenue when we transfer control of the promised products or services to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services. We derive our revenue primarily from sales of simulation and video wall systems, cyber secure products, data displays, and keyboards. We exclude sales and usage-based taxes from revenue. 

Our simulation and video wall systems are custom-built (using commercial off-the-shelf products) to customer specifications under fixed price contracts. Judgment is required to determine whether each product and service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately under the contract. Generally, these contracts contain one performance obligation (the installation of a fully functional system). We recognize revenue for these systems over time as control is transferred based on labor hours incurred on each project. 

18

Video Display Corporation and Subsidiaries

August 31, 2024

We recognize revenue related to our cyber secure products, data displays, and keyboards at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer (generally upon shipment of the product to the customer). 

Timing of invoicing to customers may differ from timing of revenue recognition; however, our contracts do not include a significant financing component as substantially all of our invoices have terms of 30 days or less. We are applying the practical expedient to exclude from consideration any contracts with payment terms of one year or less and we never offer terms extending beyond one year. 

Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. As of August 31, 2024, the Company has established a valuation allowance of 6.5 million on the Company s deferred tax assets. 

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions under the provisions of ASC 740, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount, which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating the Company's tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments. At August 31, 2024, the Company did not record any liabilities for uncertain tax positions. 

Forward - Looking Information and Risk Factors 

This report contains forward-looking statements and information that is based on management s beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to management. When used in this document, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, intends, will, and expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties, which are included under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2024 could cause actual results to differ materially. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The Company s primary market risks include changes in technology. The Company operates in an industry which is continuously changing. Failure to adapt to the changes could have a detrimental effect on the Company. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

August 31, 2024

Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2024. We perform this evaluation on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures can be reported in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to an unremediated material weakness in our internal control over financial as set forth below. 

Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting described above, management concluded that, as of August 31, 2024, a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting. 

Our material weakness related to the following control deficiency: 

The Company lacks accounting staff with the appropriate level of technical abilities to perform the control activities in the financial statement close process with a sufficient level of precision. Specifically, management had not maintained effective controls over the financial reporting process, including management review controls over key disclosures and financial reporting schedules. 

Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and is in the process of implementing control deficiency remediation efforts which includes retraining and hiring additional resources to assist with the financial reporting process. The Company believes that these remediation efforts will represent improvements in the related controls. The Company has started to implement these steps, however, some of these steps will take time to be fully integrated and confirmed to be effective and sustainable. Additional controls may also be required over time. Until the remediation steps set forth above are fully implemented and tested, the material weakness described above will continue to exist. 

Changes in Internal Controls 

There have not been any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
