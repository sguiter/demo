 and negative working capital of . The Company expects current cash on hand will not be able to fund operations for a period in excess of 12 months. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 To date management has funded its operations through selling equity securities and advances from related parties. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company generating cash from its recently established operations, the sale of its common stock and/or obtaining debt financing and attaining future profitable operations, however, there can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts. As of the date of these consolidated financial statements the Company does not have any firm commitments for capital. Without the required capital, the Company has had to reduce its development expenditures which will delay the completion of products which are expected to generate future revenues.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report and those in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2024 and all subsequent filings. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 Spectral Capital Corporation us , we , our or the Company is a technology company focused on the identification, acquisition, development, financing of technology that has the potential to transform existing industries. We look for technology that can be protected through patents or laws regarding trade secrets. Spectral management has been searching for this type of technology to develop, finance and commercialize for more than a decade. We had previously acquired stakes in two technology companies at the cutting edge of semantic search and we have been looking to combine these companies with other emerging technologies that are at an inflection point of adoption and growth where enormous value can be unlocked. We believe that the technologies that will accelerate decentralized cloud computing, in particular quantum technologies, are the enormously promising and we have determined to focus on this field. 
 
 According to Acumen Research and Consulting, in their October 12, 2023 report, the global cloud computing market will be worth 2.5 trillion dollars by 2032 and is growing at a compounded annual rate of over 17 . Spectral management determined that the best technology to identify, incubate, accelerate and finance was in the cloud computing industry, which seemed ripe for disruption, with 60 of the business controlled by a handful of large companies who charge high rates for hosting, with limited competition and fragile security solutions. Spectral determined that quantum computing technology would be faster, safer, cheaper, more secure and more energy efficient and that facilitating the infrastructure, including decentralized data centers, hardware and software solutions and the ecosystem of companies developing these solutions would be the best area within emerging technology to concentrate its efforts. 
 
 Spectral now sees its focused mission as accelerating the development of decentralized cloud computing solutions that are quantum forward, including edge and hybrid computing solutions and the materials, energy solutions, software and hardware solutions that will enable the secure, energy efficient, decentralized cloud future. Spectral believes that individuals, small and large businesses, and governments have a deep, unmet need to be freed from the tyranny of high price, quasi-monopoly, energy inefficient, insecure, centralized data centers. These centralized data centers are vulnerable to physical and cyber attack, cost a fortune and take years to build and have a negative impact on climate change. We believe there is a vast global market for the development of an alternative-and Spectral has committed to the development and deployment of decentralized, energy efficient, quantum forward micro data centers all around the world. These data centers will be cheaper and faster to build, more energy efficient, more environmentally friendly, more secure and will therefore enjoy superior profit margins to centralized cloud providers. Quantum forward, energy efficient, decentralized, hyper-secure micro data centers will deliver superior hosting solutions at a lower price. 
 
 We have been studying the cloud computing and data hosting space for some time. In December 2021, we began providing wholesale telecommunications, data and switching services consisting of international long distance reselling services on a business-to-business B2B basis. Since December 2021, we have provided this service in conjunction with approximately 3 network providers who, in turn, provided services directly to customers around the world. We paused these services in Q3 2022 because we believed that we could increase our profits if we could find partners that provide real time data exchange and technical advantages over what we had previously. We intend to resume this business in the first half of 2025 facilitated by our emerging QAAS capabilities. 
 
 On January 3, 2022, we entered into a telecommunications services agreement with Sky Data PLL OU (Estonia) Sky to provide long distance switching services. We provided services under this agreement to 3 customers and 
 14 
 
 generated 98,323 of revenue from the contract during 2022. We have paused this line of business and plan to resume our telecommunications reselling services through our partnership with SKY/Scandere in early 2025 and without third-party intervention. Testing of these services will begin initially via SKY/Scandere, and after sufficient revenue streams and data providers have been resolved, we intend to join this arrangement. Having control of this traffic will allow full transparency and full control of this line of business and will allow us to scale the initial small traffic into higher amounts without added costs. 
 
 We began the journey to augment cloud hosting solutions with decentralized, quantum forward technologies in April of 2024. At that time, Spectral management concluded that the best course to pursue in fulfilling the mission of pursuing the development and acceleration of emerging technologies was to develop expertise in the area of Quantum Computing and related technologies. Spectral engaged additional management and board resources to enhance its expertise in this area, including the engagement of board chairman Sean Michael Brehm. The Company believes it can derive revenue through the development, acquisition and sale of Quantum Computing as a Service (QAAS) as well as providing services, support and platforms to Company s operating in that sector. Toward this end, the Company has signed an agreement on June 7, 2024 for a share exchange with a Quantum Computing technology company, Node Nexus Network Co. LLC NNN in order to enhance its Quantum Computing offerings through acquiring NNN. On August 24, 2024, we closed the NNN acquisition. 
 
 Due to tax considerations and the applicability of US Federal Research and Development grants and due to the Company s desire to solicit sensitive US government work, the stock exchange transaction entered into with Node Nexus Network, LLC, a UAE limited liability company NNN that closed on August 29, 2024 has been modified in a post-closing amendment attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 dated November 13, 2024. The post-closing amendment specifies that the intellectual property being acquired by the Company from NNN has been assigned to a newly formed Delaware US entity called Vogon Cloud, Inc., a Delaware corporation Vogon Cloud ). The original NNN transaction has been rescinded and the shares reissued to Vogon Cloud for the above reasons. Therefore, the Company will proceed with an audit of Vogon Cloud and will continue to commercialize the intellectual property without interruption. There is no longer any relationship between the Company and NNN and the parties have signed a mutual release to that effect. The licenses to the formerly NNN intellectual property are now held by the Company through its interest in Vogon Cloud, which includes the underlying concepts and assignments of 104 innovations that the Company is in the process of protecting under US and international patent law. The Company expects to file 104 provisional utility patents with the USPTO by December 31, 2024 based on the Vogon Cloud technology and the Quantomo OU acquisition listed below. In addition to the innovations developed in the patents referenced in this section which are related to the middleware, load balancing, security, efficiency, design, energy consumption, composite materials and semiconductor design of hybrid and edge computing systems. In addition, Vogon Cloud owns the following products which are now owned by Spectral: (1) Vogon Cloud-Superior Quantum Hosting Software. This software provides Distributed Quantum ledger technology to Spectral. This product provides immutable, fast, decentralized, cost-effective and environmentally friendly storage for enterprise-level data and for critical transactions. (2) QuantumVM-Critical Middleware . Spectral now owns as a result of the Vogon Cloud acquisition, QuantumVM-Critical Middleware, which is a hyper-efficient virtual machine that allows companies to use and integrate their legacy data in a quantum environment, optimizing the mix of classical cloud and quantum systems for maximum efficiency. 
 
 The Company believes that QAAS is exactly the type of technology that management has been searching for, as it has the potential to disrupt the way that classical computing cloud service providers meet the needs of enterprise customers. QAAS offerings have the potential to create faster, safer and more efficient methods of data storage and retrieval. The additional management resources that the Company has added in this area include the appointment of Chairman and member of the board of directors, Sean Michael Brehm. Mr. Brehm has a background developing and deploying large scale enterprise software solutions for the public and the private sector. He has led teams that have developed Quantum Computing solutions that make these technologies accessible for enterprise software clients without developed Quantum Computing infrastructure. 
 
 Management intends to develop a suite of QAAS solutions as well as to identify and partner with startups in the QAAS field. 
 
 Quantum Computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations that far surpass the capabilities of classical computers. Its transformative potential spans numerous sectors, including cryptography, drug discovery, supply chain management and materials science, with the potential to transform what is possible in these 
 15 
 
 sectors. However, practical implementation remains challenging due to technological complexities, high development costs, and a shortage of skilled professionals. This is a field where a number of startups have emerged that lack the full infrastructure, funding, expertise, access to shared platforms and markets that exist as mature ecosystems within the software as a service field (SAAS) that traditionally meets the classical computing needs of enterprise customers. 
 
 Spectral s approach to QAAS is a fundamentally decentralized one that puts users in full charge and control of Quantum Computing technologies. We believe that this approach, which follows in the open source software ethos, will be attractive to enterprise customers. Our market research to date suggests that the advantages of incumbency in the SAAS space seem to be less pronounced in the QAAS space, where no company has yet established itself as a market leader. This gives Spectral the opportunity to compete for business with enterprise customers in the QAAS field on a more level playing field than in the field of classical cloud computing solutions. 
 
 The Company has also undertaken to revitalize both its Noot and Monitor technologies and resume operations of those two companies using a QAAS approach. Management believes that the architecture of both of these products is well suited to the type of enhancements a QAAS approach can provide. 
 
 The Company also believes that QAAS will increase demand for the SKY/Scandere data and switching services and that the data centers required by QAAS companies will allow the Company to substantially grow its data center business in a way that enhances customer security, is climate friendly and facilitates needed decentralization in the sector.

 On August 22, 2024. we issued 40 million shares of the Common Stock in escrow to Node Nexus under the Exchange Agreement as amended and took possession and control of the Node Nexus assets. 
 
 On August 28, 2024, we executed a second amendment to the Exchange Agreement whereby we agreed to issue 1,000,000 shares of Series Quantum preferred stock (the Series Quantum Preferred Stock in lieu of the 40,000,000 common shares provided for under the Exchange agreement as previously amended. Each one (1) share of the Series Quantum Preferred Stock is convertible into forty (40) shares of our Common Stock by the holder or the Company provided that the holder has held the Series Quantum Preferred Stock for at least 12 months and the Company has authorized common shares to effectuate such conversion. 
 
 On August 29, 2024, the Exchange Agreement as amended was fully performed and the shares in Node Nexus were delivered to the Company. 
 
 Due to tax considerations and the applicability of US Federal Research and Development grants and due to the Company s desire to solicit sensitive US government work, the stock exchange transaction entered into with Node Nexus Network, LLC, a UAE limited liability company NNN that closed on August 29, 2024 was been modified in a post-closing amendment attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 dated November 13, 2024. The post-closing amendment specifies that the intellectual property being acquired by the Company from NNN has been assigned to a newly formed Delaware US entity called Vogon Cloud Inc., a Delaware corporation Vogon Cloud ). The original NNN transaction has been rescinded and the 1,000,000 shares reissued to Sean Michael Brehm for the above reasons. Therefore, the Company will proceed with an audit of Vogon Cloud and will continue to commercialize the intellectual property without interruption. There is no longer any relationship between the Company and NNN and the parties have signed a mutual release to that effect. The licenses to the formerly NNN intellectual property are now held by the Company through its interest in Vogon Cloud. The Company expects to file 104 provisional utility patents with the USPTO by December 31, 2024 based on the Vogon Cloud technology and the Quantomo OU acquisition listed below. It was originally determined that the share exchange agreement closed effective August 29, 2024. However, the Company 
 17 
 
 has determined that the transaction was never formally closed or title to the IP formally delivered to Spectral because of problems NNN had with its record keeping and ability to deliver certificates and other requirements under the agreement and that Spectral never formally received the shares in NNN as required by the agreement. Therefore, it was an error to state that the transaction had formally closed. Rather than revisit the transaction in an effort to cure defects, the Company and NNN decided to rescind the transaction. On November 14, 2024, the transaction was rescinded. The 1,000,000 Series Quantum Preferred Shares that were issued have been assigned to a new Delaware corporation which was assigned the intellectual property previously owned by NNN. There is no longer a connection between NNN and Spectral. See Note 3.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses increased 1,194,986, from 45,722 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,194,986 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the current period, the increase was primarily due to stock-based compensation of 419,819 related to the vesting of options for services as well as 548,398 in research and development incurred related to the development of our technologies and software. 
 
 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses increased 1,571,142, from 173,133 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,744,275 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the current period, the increase was primarily due to stock-based compensation of 749,332 related to the issuance of options and common stock from services as well as 548,398 in research and development incurred related to the development of our technologies and software. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 190,614 cash on hand. We intend to fund operations through the use of cash on hand, cash flows from operations and through debt and equity financings until sufficient cash flows from operations can be achieved. 
 
 Net cash used in operating, activities increased 846,127 from 40,133 in cash used during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 886,260 cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was due to the Company collecting a significant amounts of accounts receivable in the prior year as well as an increase in the loss during the current year due to the Company expending a significant amount of capital to improve the corporate structure of the Company and to pursue and exploit new technologies. 
 18 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 128,907 from 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 128,907 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to the cash payment made in connection with the proposed acquisition further discussed in Note 5. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased by 1,174,963 from 30,577 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,205,540 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to proceeds from short term advances and capital raised through our offerings. 
 
 We believe that our current financial resources are not sufficient to meet our working capital requirements over the next year. Additional funding will be necessary in order to expand portfolio operations and to reach our goals. Currently, the Company does not have any commitments or assurances for additional capital nor can the Company provide assurance that such financing will be available to it on favourable terms, or at all. If, after utilizing the existing sources of capital available to the Company, further capital needs are identified and the Company is not successful in obtaining the financing, it may be forced to curtail its existing or planned future operations. In addition, if necessary, we will decrease expenses and redirect our efforts towards a sale of one of more of our assets should funding become inadequate. 
 
 We believe that our short-term prospects are promising. The Company has spent more than a decade actively researching, identifying and testing the types of disruptive technologies that could be enhanced by common management and technological resources and it feels that it has found such technologies in the Quantum Computing field as well as in the applications of Quantum Computing to both the Noot and Monitor portfolio company solutions. We also believe that we will experience significant operational and financial growth as a result of entering the QAAS field, as a result of the enhancements this technology will provide to our two portfolio companies as well as to our data center business. We also believe that the acquisition of Vogon Cloud, Inc. and Quantomo.OU will further enhance our QAAS offerings. However, we need significant capital to implement our plan.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our management, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing evaluation, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 and that they do not allow for information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive and Principal Accounting Financial Officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 The material weaknesses were first identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 in which related to a lack of an accounting staff resulting in a lack of segregation of duties necessary for an effective system of internal control. The weakness in segregation of duties will continue to exist until such time as management can retain internal staff to properly segregate duties. 
 
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
