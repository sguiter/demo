U.S. Treasury Notes, U.S. government-sponsored agencies and the other available-for-sale securities reflected in the above table that the Company holds in its investment portfolio were in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 , but the unrealized loss was not recognized into income because the U.S. Treasury Notes are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States and the other issuers were high credit q uality, it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery occurs and the decline in fair value was due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The fair values of these securities are expected to recover as maturity dates of these securities approach. 
 
 We reviewed the available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position within the guidelines of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 326 and determined that no credit loss is required to be recognized. 
 
 The proceeds from sales of securities and the associated losses were as follows:

Collateral Dependent Loans 

Management's evaluation as to the ultimate collectability of loans includes estimates regarding future cash flows from operations and the value of property, real and personal, pledged as collateral. These estimates are affected by changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of borrowers. Collateral dependent loans are loans in which repayment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment. Loans are written down to the lower of cost or fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell. The Compan y had million of collateral dependent loans secured by real estate or business assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 

Individually Evaluated Loans 
 
 The following tables present loans individually evaluated by class of loans: 

Multi-family residential real estate 
 Nonresidential real estate 
 Commercial loans and leases 

Commercial loans and leases 

Nonaccrual Loans 
 
 The following tables present the recorded investment in nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due still on accrual by class of loans: 

Multi-family residential real estate 
 Nonresidential real estate 
 Commercial loans and leases 
 
 December 31, 2023 
 One-to-four family residential real estate 
 Commercial loans and leases 

Nonaccrual loans and individually evaluated loans are defined differently. Some loans may be included in both categories, and some loans may only be included in one category. Nonaccrual loans include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated and loans individually evaluated. 
 
 The Company s reserve for uncollected loan interest was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. When a loan is on nonaccrual status and the ultimate collectability of the total principal of a loan is in doubt, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. Alternatively, when a loan is on nonaccrual status but there is doubt concerning only the ultimate collectability of interest, contractual interest is credited to interest income only when received, under the cash basis method. In all cases, the average balances are calculated based on the month end balances of the financing receivables within the period reported. 

Past Due Loans 
 
 The following tables present the aging of the recorded investment of loans by portfolio segment:

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had no loan modifications that meet the definition described in ASU 2022 - 02 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326 ): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures for additional reporting. 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, including current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. Risk ratings are updated any time the situation warrants. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 
 Pass. This category includes loans that are all considered acceptable credits, ranging from investment or near investment grade, to loans made to borrowers who exhibit credit fundamentals that meet or exceed industry standards. 
 
 Special Mention. A Special Mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution s credit position at some future date. Special Mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 
 
 Substandard. Loans categorized as Substandard continue to accrue interest, but exhibit a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. The loans continue to accrue interest because they are well secured and collection of principal and interest is expected within a reasonable time. The risk rating guidance published by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency clarifies that a loan with a well-defined weakness does not have to present a probability of default for the loan to be rated Substandard, and that an individual loan s loss potential does not have to be distinct for the loan to be rated Substandard. 
 
 Nonaccrual. An asset classified Nonaccrual has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 Based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk categories of loans by class of loans are as follows: 

Multi-family residential real estate 
 Nonresidential real estate 
 Commercial loans and leases

 Subordinated notes, due May 15, 2031 
 Line of credit, due March 28, 2025 

In 2021, the Company entered into Subordinated Note Purchase Agreements with certain qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors pursuant to which the Company sold and issued million in aggregate principal amount of its Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due May 15, 2031 the Notes ). The Company incurred of issuance costs associated with the Notes. These issuance costs are being amortized over the -year life of the Notes. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were and , respectively, in remaining unamortized issuance costs and they are presented in the Company's financial statements as a reduction of the principal amount of the Notes. 
 
 The Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of , from and including the date of issuance to May 14, 2026, payable semi-annually in arrears. From and including May 15, 2026, but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, as applicable, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to Three-Month Term SOFR (as defined in the Notes) plus basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. Under the conditions specified in the Notes, the interest rate accruing during the applicable floating rate period may be determined based on a rate other than Three-Month Term SOFR. The Notes have a stated maturity date of May 15, 2031 and are redeemable, in whole or in part, on May 15, 2026, on any interest payment date thereafter, and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events. 
 
 Principal and interest payments due on the Notes are subject to acceleration only in limited circumstances in the case of certain bankruptcy and insolvency-related events with respect to the Company. The Notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of the Company and generally rank junior in right of payment to the Company s current and future senior indebtedness. The Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. 
 
 In March 2024, we repurchased million of the Notes and recorded a gain on repurchase. 
 
 In 2020, the Comp any established a million unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank. Interest is payable at a rate of Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal minus , with a minimum rate of . The line of credit has been extended since its original maturity date and the current maturity date is March 28, 2025. T he line of credit had outstanding balance at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 

Loans Evaluated Individually: The Company does not record portfolio loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, periodically, a loan is evaluated individually and is reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. If the collateral value is not sufficient, a specific reserve is recorded. Collateral values are estimated using a combination of observable inputs, including recent appraisals, and unobservable inputs based on customized discounting criteria. Due to the significance of unobservable inputs, fair values of individually evaluated collateral dependent loans have been classified as Level 3. 
 
 Foreclosed assets: Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach with data from comparable properties. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Foreclosed assets are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. 
 
 Premises held-for-sale: At the time of transfer to held-for sale, these assets are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. These assets are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted as necessary. During 2023, we recorded a valuation adjustment of at the time of transfer of two of our retail branches to premises held-for-sale. During the second quarter of 2023, we recorded an additional valuation adjustment of on our Hazel Crest office based on the purchase price of the then pending sale agreement for the facility.

Loans : The exit price observations are obtained from an independent third -party using its proprietary valuation model and methodology and may not reflect actual or prospective market valuations. The valuation is based on the probability of default, loss given default, recovery delay, prepayment, and discount rate assumptions. 
 
 While the above estimates are based on management s judgment of the most appropriate factors, as of the balance sheet date, there is no assurance that the estimated fair values would have been realized if the assets were disposed of or the liabilities settled at that date, since market values may differ depending on the various circumstances. The estimated fair values would also not apply to subsequent dates.

 A description of the Company's revenue streams accounted for under ASC 606 follows: 
 
 Deposit service charges and fees: The Company earns fees from its deposit customers based on specific types of transactions, account maintenance and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees, which include services such as ATM use fees, stop payment charges, statement rendering, and ACH fees, are recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the point in time the Company fulfills the customer's request. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the Company satisfies the performance obligation. Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft occurs. Service charges on deposits are withdrawn from the customer's account balance. 
 
 Interchange income: The Company earns interchange fees from debit cardholder transactions conducted through the Visa payment network. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. Interchange income is included in deposit service charges and fees. Interchange income was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Interchange income was and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Trust and insurance commissions and annuities income: The Company earns trust, insurance commissions and annuities income from its contracts with trust customers to manage assets for investment, and/or to transact on their accounts. These fees are primarily earned over time as the Company provides the contracted monthly or quarterly services and are generally assessed based on a tiered scale of the market value of assets under management (AUM) at month-end. Fees that are transaction-based, including trade execution services, are recognized at the point in time that the transaction is executed, i.e ., the trade date. Other related services provided include fees the Company earns, which are based on a fixed fee schedule and are recognized when the services are rendered. 
 
 Gains/losses on sales of foreclosed assets and other assets: The Company records a gain or loss from the sale of foreclosed assets and other assets when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally occurs at the time of an executed deed. When the Company finances the sale of foreclosed assets to the buyer, the Company assesses whether the buyer is committed to perform their obligations under the contract and whether collectability of the transaction price is probable. Once these criteria are met, the foreclosed asset is derecognized and the gain or loss on sale is recorded upon the transfer of control of the property to the buyer. In determining the gain or loss on the sale, the Company adjusts the transaction price and related gain (loss) on sale if a significant financing component is present. Foreclosed assets sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not financed by the Company.

 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains, and other periodic and current reports, press releases and other public stockholder communications of BankFinancial Corporation may contain, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements may include statements relating to our future plans, strategies and expectations, as well as our future revenues, expenses, earnings, losses, financial performance, financial condition, asset quality metrics and future prospects. Forward looking statements are generally identifiable by use of the words believe, may, will, should, could, continue, expect, estimate, intend, anticipate, preliminary, project, plan, or similar expressions. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date made. They are frequently based on assumptions that may or may not materialize, and are subject to numerous uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements. We intend all forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for the purpose of invoking these safe harbor provisions. 
 
 Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated or projected and which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition or future prospects include, but are not limited to: (i) the impact of re-pricing and competitors pricing initiatives on loan and deposit products (ii) interest rate movements and their impact on the economy, customer behavior, the market value of securities and our net interest margin (iii) changes in U.S. Government or State government budgets, appropriations or funding allocation policies or practices affecting our credit exposures to U.S. Government or State governments, agencies or related entities, or borrowers' dependent on the receipt of Federal or State appropriations, including but not limited to, defense, healthcare, transportation, education and law enforcement programs (iv) less than anticipated loan and lease growth (v) for any significant credit exposure, borrower-specific adverse developments with respect to the adequacy of cash flows, liquidity or collateral (vi) the inherent credit risks of lending activities, including risks that could cause changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and charge-offs (vii) adverse economic conditions in general, or specific events such as a pandemic or national or international war, act of conflict or terrorism, and in the markets in which we lend that could result in increased delinquencies in our loan portfolio or a decline in the value of our investment securities and the collateral for our loans (viii) declines in real estate values that adversely impact the value of our loan collateral, other real estate owned ("OREO"), asset dispositions and the level of borrower equity in their investments (ix) results of supervisory monitoring or examinations by regulatory authorities, including the possibility that a regulatory authority could, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for credit losses or adversely change our loan classifications, write-down assets, reduce credit concentrations or maintain specific capital levels (x) changes, disruptions or illiquidity in national or global financial markets (xi) monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board (xii) factors affecting our ability to retain or access deposits or cost-effective funding, including changes in public confidence, withdrawals of deposits not insured by the FDIC or the availability of other borrowing sources for any reason (xiii) legislative or regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on our products, services, operations and operating expenses (xiv) higher federal deposit insurance premiums (xv) higher than expected overhead, infrastructure and compliance costs (xvi) changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines (xvii) the effects of any federal government shutdown or failure to enact legislation related to the maximum permitted amount of U.S. Government debt obligations and (xviii) privacy and cybersecurity risks, including the risks of business interruption and the compromise of confidential customer information resulting from intrusions. 
 
 These risks and uncertainties, together with the Risk Factors and other information set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as well as Part II, Items 1A of our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings we make with the SEC, should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition and results of operations depend, and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments, are included in the discussion entitled Critical Accounting Policies in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We reported net income of 2.0 million, or 0.16 per common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had total assets of 1.418 billion, total loans of 923.9 million, total deposits of 1.199 billion and stockholders' equity of 159 million. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, interest income decreased by 769,000 primarily due to declines in commercial loans and lease balances. Interest expense increased by 146,000 due to retail depositors seeking higher-yielding account types. Our tax-equivalent net interest margin decreased to 3.47 from 3.67 . 
 
 Noninterest income increased by 206,000, primarily due to increased deposit service charges and fees and trust department income, as well as improved returns on bank-owned life insurance. 
 
 Noninterest expense decreased by 1.1 million. Compensation and benefits declined by 502,000 due to a 9 reduction in full time equivalent headcount since the end of the first quarter of 2024 and reduced incentive compensation expense. Office occupancy and information technology expense declined by 407,000 due to adjustments to estimated real estate tax accruals and reduced transaction processing software expense.

Cash Cash-Equivalent Assets 
 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalent assets represented 9.8 of total assets, compared to 10.3 of total assets at June 30, 2024. 
 
 Investment Securities Portfolio 
 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, total investment securities increased by 42.0 million due to 139.0 million in purchases, offset by 98.5 million of maturities and redemptions of U.S. Treasury Notes and U.S. government-sponsored agency securities. The investment securities portfolio had a weighted-average term to maturity of 1.09 years as of September 30, 2024, with an after-tax unrealized loss of 842,000 or 0.5 of Tier 1 capital. 
 
 Loan Portfolio 
 
 Our loan portfolio declined by 63.8 million in the third quarter of 2024. Multi-family residential loans decreased by 3.2 million (0.6 due to scheduled loan repayments. Commercial finance balances decreased by 21.8 million (23.5 primarily due to a planned 18.8 million reduction in balances from principal repayments and line of credit payoffs within the healthcare finance portfolio and lessor finance portfolio for risk management purposes. Equipment finance balances declined by 37.2 million (15.1 due to scheduled repayments, partially offset by modestly higher originations of corporate equipment finance transactions. The average yield on our loan portfolio decreased to 5.07 . 
 
 Loan demand for all commercial credit categories was muted for the first two months of the third quarter of 2024. Towards the end of the quarter, demand for multi-family residential loans and nonresidential real estate loans expected to fund in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased due to lower market interest rates and expanded marketing activities. Demand for new equipment finance transactions remained stagnant while the equipment finance pipeline duration extended further due to delays in delivery and installation for approved equipment finance transactions. Demand for commercial finance transactions and commercial line utilization remained sporadic, as borrowers utilized available liquidity instead of unused credit availability; however, increased marketing to small- and medium-businesses continued to produce modest improvements in new credit facility opportunities compared to previous quarters. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 
 The ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets increased to 1.71 at September 30, 2024, from 1.54 at June 30, 2024, inclusive of two U.S. Government equipment finance transactions totaling 18.9 million. Excluding these two U.S. Government transactions, our ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets would have been 0.38 at September 30, 2024. The Bank placed a 1.5 million multi-family residential borrower relationship in the Chicago MSA market on nonaccrual status until the pending receivership and sale of the collateral is consummated in the fourth quarter of 2024. Past due trends improved, and nonperforming asset resolution activity continued to accelerate during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses increased to 0.85 of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.82 at June 30, 2024. 
 
 Deposit Portfolio 
 
 Total deposits decreased by 52.9 million (4.2 ). Noninterest-bearing demand deposit balances declined by 35.7 million, primarily due to the withdrawal of 20.0 million deposited in connection with the acquisition of a commercial real estate property late in the second quarter of 2024, the liquidation of 4.8 million in cash collateral securing a commercial finance letter of credit drawn by the beneficiary, and typical balance volatility for certain other commercial depositors. Interest-bearing deposit balances (consisting of interest-bearing NOW accounts, money market accounts and savings deposits) declined by 22.1 million primarily due to seasonal expenses such as real estate taxes, college tuition and capital expenditures, with competition from equity markets and non-bank money market mutual funds also being a contributing factor. Certificates of deposits increased by 5.0 million due to retail depositors seeking higher long-term yields in anticipation of lower short-term market yields in the future. The cost of our total retail and commercial deposits increased to 1.94 during the third quarter of 2024 from 1.87 at June 30, 2024. Core deposits represented 81 of total deposits, with noninterest-bearing demand deposits representing 19 of total deposits at September 30, 2024. Total commercial deposits were 20 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and 22 of total deposits at June 30, 2024. FDIC-insured deposits represented 84.42 of total deposits and collateralized public funds deposits represented 1.92 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Capital Adequacy 
 
 The Company s capital position remained strong, with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.11 at September 30, 2024. The book value of the Company s common shares increased to 12.77 at September 30, 2024 from 12.64 at June 30, 2024.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 
 Total assets decreased 69.7 million, or 4.7 , to 1.418 billion at September 30, 2024, from 1.487 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease in total assets was primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents and loans receivable, partially offset by an increase in securities. Cash and cash equivalents decreased 40.2 million to 138.3 million at September 30, 2024, from 178.5 million at December 31, 2023, while loans receivable decreased 126.8 million to 923.9 million. Securities increased 111.7 million to 264.9 million at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our loan portfolio consists primarily of investment and business loans (multi-family, nonresidential real estate, and commercial loans and leases), which together totaled 98.1 of gross loans at September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, commercial loans and leases decreased by 113.1 million, or 28.8 , and nonresidential real estate loans decreased by 8.2 million, or 7.0 . The decrease in commercial loans and leases was primarily due to decreases in government and corporate leases of 47.5 million and 28.5 million, respectively, due to scheduled payments and payoffs. The decrease in nonresidential real estate loans was due to 11.0 million of payments and payoffs in the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Our primary lending area for regulatory purposes consists of the counties in the State of Illinois where our branch offices are located, and contiguous counties. We currently derive the most significant portion of our revenues from these geographic areas. We also engage in multi-family residential real estate lending activities in carefully selected metropolitan areas outside our primary lending area, and we engage in certain types of commercial lending and commercial equipment finance activities on a nationwide basis. At September 30, 2024, 316.2 million, or 60.4 , of our multi-family residential real estate loans were in the Metropolitan Statistical Area for Chicago, Illinois 70.7 million, or 13.5 , were in Florida 68.0 million, or 13.0 , were in Texas and 26.3 million, or 5.0 , were in North Carolina. This information reflects the location of the collateral for the loan and does not necessarily reflect the location of the borrowers. At September 30, 2024, our concentrations within the nonresidential real estate portfolio were retail shopping malls of 46.5 million, or 42.4 ; office buildings of 17.2 million, or 15.6 ; mixed use buildings of 13.4 million, or 12.2 ; and industrial buildings of 10.4 million, or 9.4 . We experienced no material adverse developments in the portfolio related to hurricane activity affecting these geographic markets. 
 
 Total liabilities decreased 73.4 million, or 5.5 , to 1.259 billion at September 30, 2024, from 1.332 billion at December 31, 2023, due to a decrease in total deposits, a 1.0 million repurchase of our Notes, and decreases in accrued interest payable and other liabilities. Total deposits decreased 62.2 million, or 4.9 , to 1.199 billion at September 30, 2024, from 1.262 billion at December 31, 2023. Money market accounts increased 9.6 million, or 3.2 , to 306.7 million at September 30, 2024, from 297.1 million at December 31, 2023. Retail certificates of deposit also increased 6.1 million, or 2.7 , to 228.5 million at September 30, 2024, from 222.4 million at December 31, 2023. These increases were offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits of 34.0 million, or 13.0 , to 226.9 million at September 30, 2024, from 260.9 million at December 31, 2023 and interest-bearing NOW accounts of 30.0 million, or 9.8 , to 276.6 million at September 30, 2024, from 306.5 million at December 31, 2023. Savings accounts decreased 13.9 million, or 8.0 , to 160.8 million at September 30, 2024, from 174.8 million at December 31, 2023. Core deposits (which consists of savings, money market, noninterest-bearing demand and NOW accounts) represented 81.0 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and 82.4 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Total stockholders equity was 159.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 155.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in total stockholders equity was primarily due to net income of 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a 1.8 million decrease, net of tax, of accumulated other comprehensive loss on our securities portfolio, partially offset by our repurchase of 15,203 shares of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 at a total cost of 156,000, and our declaration and payment of cash dividends totaling 3.7 million during the same period. 

Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net Income. Net income was 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per basic and fully diluted share of common stock were 0.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.19 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Interest Income . Net interest income was 11.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.3 million decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a 1.3 million increase in interest expense. 
 
 The increase in interest expense was due in substantial part to an increase in the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 56 basis points to 2.04 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.48 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 30 basis points to 4.94 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.64 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total average interest-earning assets decreased 84.4 million, or 5.8 , to 1.360 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.444 billion for the same period in 2023. Total average interest-bearing liabilities decreased 35.4 million, or 3.4 , to 1.020 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.056 billion for the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest-bearing liabilities is partially attributable to a 33.7 million decrease in average deposits. Our net interest rate spread decreased by 26 basis points to 2.90 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.16 for the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in the cost of deposits. Our net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, decreased ten basis points to 3.47 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.57 for the same period in 2023.

Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 The ACL is a significant estimate in our unaudited consolidated financial statements, affecting both earnings and capital. The methodology adopted influences, and is influenced by, the Bank s overall credit risk management processes. The ACL is recorded in accordance with US GAAP to provide an adequate reserve for expected credit losses that is reflective of management s best estimate of what is expected to be collected. All estimates of credit losses should be based on careful consideration of all significant factors affecting the collectability as of the evaluation date. The ACL is established through the provision for credit loss expense charged to income. 
 
 The provision for credit losses loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 472,000 and 180,000, respectively. The provision for, or recovery of, credit losses loans varies based on, among other things, forecasted unemployment rates, loan growth, net charge-offs, collateral values associated with collateral dependent loans and qualitative factors. 
 
 There were no reserves established for loans individually evaluated at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs were 715,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 847,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 35.37 at September 30, 2024, compared to 39.12 at June 30, 2024. Excluding the effect of the two U.S. Government financing transactions, totaling 18.9 million, on nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans would have been 229.49 at September 30, 2024.

Noninterest expense decreased 706,000, or 6.5 , to 10.1 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.8 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to decreases in expenses for office occupancy and equipment, advertising, professional fees, FDIC insurance premiums, and other expenses. These decreases were partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits expense and information technology expense. Office occupancy and equipment decreased 514,000, or 25.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to decreases in real estate taxes and rent expense. Advertising expenses decreased 54,000, or 31.6 , to 117,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. FDIC insurance premiums decreased 66,000, or 29.7 , to 156,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to a decrease in the assessment rate as well as a decrease in the assessment base.

Income Taxes 
 
 We recorded income tax expense of 581,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 899,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our combined state and federal effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.6 , compared to 27.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The tax rate for 2024 was favorably impacted by the tax benefit of interest earned on U.S. Treasury Notes and U.S. government-sponsored agency securities. 

Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net Income. Net income was 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per basic and fully diluted share of common stock were 0.47 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.58 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Interest Income . Net interest income was 36.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 39.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 2.6 million decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a 5.3 million increase in interest expense, offset partially by the 2.7 million increase in interest income. 
 
 The increase in interest expense was due in substantial part to an increase in the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 73 basis points to 1.95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 49 basis points to 4.98 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total average interest-earning assets decreased 74.5 million, or 5.1 , to 1.391 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.466 billion for the same period in 2023. Total average interest-bearing liabilities decreased 39.7 million, or 3.7 , to 1.034 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.074 billion for the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest-bearing liabilities is attributable to a 42.3 million decrease in average deposits, partially offset by the increase in FHLB advances in 2023. Our net interest rate spread decreased by 24 basis points to 3.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.27 for the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in the cost of deposits. Our net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, decreased three basis points to 3.58 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.61 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Compensation and benefits expense increased 883,000, or 5.3 to 17.4 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.6 million for the same period in 2023, due in part to increased payroll costs and benefit costs, in addition to decreased loan originations resulting in lower compensation costs being recorded as deferred loan origination costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Information technology expenses increased 264,000, or 9.6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased core banking contract renewal costs, the implementation of new Treasury Services software, and hardware upgrade consulting costs. FDIC insurance premiums decreased 197,000, or 29.9 , to 461,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a decrease in the assessment rate as well as a decrease in the assessment base. Other expense increased 527,000, or 14.7 , to 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.6 million for the same period in 2023. Year to date 2024, we recorded 407,000 of increased legal fees and other expenses related to nonperforming loans and 225,000 for the final resolution of pending litigation and inter-creditor tax liability related to a middle market equipment finance transaction, as well as recording losses totaling 227,000 on sales of foreclosed assets.

Nonperforming Loans and Assets 
 
 We review loans on a regular basis, and generally place loans on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. In addition, we place loans on nonaccrual status when we do not expect to receive full payment of interest or principal. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed from interest income. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are recognized in accordance with our significant accounting policies. Once a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the borrower must generally demonstrate at least six consecutive months of contractual payment performance before the loan is eligible to return to accrual status. We may have loans classified as 90 days or more delinquent and still accruing. Generally, we do not utilize this category of loan classification unless: (1) the loan is repaid in full shortly after the period end date; (2) the loan is well secured and there are no asserted or pending legal barriers to its collection; or (3) the borrower has remitted all scheduled payments and is otherwise in substantial compliance with the terms of the loan, but the processing of loan payments actually received or the renewal of the loan has not occurred for administrative reasons. At September 30, 2024, we have no loans in this category.

Nonperforming Assets 
 
 Nonperforming assets increased 1.6 million during the third quarter, to 24.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 22.7 million at June 30, 2024, and 25.1 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 1.5 million multi-family residential borrower relationship in the Chicago MSA market that we placed on nonaccrual status pending the expected sale of the collateral in the fourth quarter 2024. The Company s ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was 1.71 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.69 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 In 2023, we classified two U.S. Government equipment finance exposures totaling 18.9 million as nonperforming assets. Given the unexpected conduct by the U.S. Government in these two transactions and information we learned about similar activity encountered by other participants in the market, we discontinued originations of U.S. Government equipment finance transactions in early 2023 pending the outcome of our claims. With respect to these two U.S. Government equipment finance transactions, we submitted Contract Disputes Act claims to the U.S. Government in March 2024 for the 10.5 million transaction and in August 2024 for the 8.4 million transaction. As of September 30, 2024, both claims remain under review by the respective government entities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity. The overall objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash funds to meet all financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities. We manage liquidity in order to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise. 
 
 Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and, to a lesser extent, wholesale borrowings, the proceeds from maturing securities and short-term investments, the sales of loans and securities and lease payments. The scheduled amortization of loans and securities, as well as proceeds from borrowings, are predictable sources of funds. Other funding sources, however, such as deposit inflows, mortgage prepayments and mortgage loan sales are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments and lines of credit and maturing certificates of deposit that are not renewed or extended. We generally remain fully invested and utilize FHLB advances as an additional source of funds. We had 20.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 25.0 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company is a separate legal entity from BankFinancial, NA. The Company must provide for its own liquidity to pay any dividends to its stockholders and to repurchase shares of its common stock, and for other corporate purposes. The Company's primary source of liquidity is dividend payments it receives from the Bank. The Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company is subject to regulatory limitations. The Company completed the issuance of 20.0 million of subordinated notes in 2021, at a rate of 3.75 maturing on May 15, 2031. In March 2024, the Company repurchased 1.0 million of these subordinated notes and recorded a gain of 107,000. At September 30, 2024, the Company (on an unconsolidated, stand-alone basis) had liquid assets of 12.8 million. In 2020, the Company obtained a 5.0 million unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank to provide a secondary source of liquidity. Interest is payable at a rate of Prime rate minus 0.50 . The line of credit has been extended since its original maturity date and the current maturity date is March 28, 2025. The line of credit had no outstanding balance at September 30, 2024. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were not aware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that had or were reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, we had no other material commitments for capital expenditures. 
 
 Capital Management - Bank. The overall objectives of our capital management are to ensure the availability of sufficient capital to support loan, deposit and other asset and liability growth opportunities and to maintain sufficient capital to absorb unforeseen losses or write-downs that are inherent in the business risks associated with the banking industry. We seek to balance the need for higher capital levels to address such unforeseen risks and the goal to achieve an adequate return on the capital invested by our stockholders. 
 
 The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. The capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulation, involve the quantitative measurement of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. The failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in regulatory actions. The net unrealized gain or loss on available-for-sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital. 
 
 The federal banking agencies have developed a Community Bank Leverage Ratio (the ratio of a bank s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than 10 billion. A qualifying community bank that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered well capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The federal banking agencies may consider a financial institution s risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement. The federal banking agencies must set the minimum capital for the new Community Bank Leverage Ratio at not less than 8 and not more than 10 . Beginning January 1, 2022, banking organizations that had a leverage ratio of 9 or greater and met certain other criteria could elect to use the Community Bank Leverage Ratio framework. A financial institution can elect to be subject to this new definition, and opt-out of this new definition, at any time. As a qualifying community bank, we elected to be subject to this definition beginning in the second quarter of 2020. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank's Community Bank Leverage Ratio was 11.48 . 
 
 Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If only adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required.

Table of Contents 

The Company and the Bank have each adopted Regulatory Capital Policies that target a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 7.5 and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.5 at the Bank. The minimum capital ratios set forth in the Regulatory Capital Policies will be increased and other minimum capital requirements will be established if and as necessary. In accordance with the Regulatory Capital Policies, the Bank will not pursue any acquisition or growth opportunity, declare any dividend or conduct any stock repurchase that would cause the Bank's total risk-based capital ratio and/or its Tier 1 leverage ratio to fall below the targeted minimum capital levels or the capital levels required for capital adequacy plus the capital conservation buffer CCB ). The minimum CCB is 2.5 . As of September 30, 2024 the Bank was well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the Bank s prompt corrective action capitalization category. 
 
 The Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends it may declare and pay to the Company without prior regulatory approval, and to regulatory notification requirements for dividends that do not require prior regulatory approval.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Qualitative Analysis. A significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk results from timing differences in the maturity or repricing of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts i.e., forward loan commitments), the effect of loan prepayments and deposit withdrawals, the difference in the behavior of lending and funding rates arising from the use of different indices and yield curve risk arising from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities for constant or variable credit risk investments. In addition to directly affecting net interest income, changes in market interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations, the ability of borrowers to repay variable rate loans, the volume of loan prepayments and refinancings, the carrying value of investment securities classified as available-for-sale and the flow and mix of deposits. 
 
 The general objective of our interest rate risk management is to determine the appropriate level of risk given our business strategy and then manage that risk in a manner that is consistent with our policy to reduce, to the extent possible, the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee ALCO ), which consists of certain members of senior management, evaluates the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities, our operating environment and capital and liquidity requirements, and modifies our lending, investing and deposit gathering strategies accordingly. The Board of Directors then reviews the ALCO s activities and strategies, the effect of those strategies on our net interest margin, and the effect that changes in market interest rates would have on the economic value of our loan and securities portfolios as well as the intrinsic value of our deposits and borrowings, and reports to the full Board of Directors. 
 
 We actively evaluate interest rate risk in connection with our lending, investing and deposit activities. In an effort to better manage interest rate risk, we have de-emphasized the origination of residential mortgage loans, and have increased our emphasis on the origination of nonresidential real estate loans, multi-family residential real estate loans, and commercial loans and commercial leases. In addition, depending on market interest rates and our capital and liquidity position, we generally sell all or a portion of our longer-term, fixed-rate residential loans, and usually on a servicing-retained basis. Further, we primarily invest in shorter-duration securities, which generally have lower yields compared to longer-term investments. Shortening the average maturity of our interest-earning assets by increasing our investments in shorter-term loans and securities, as well as loans with variable rates of interest, helps to better match the maturities and interest rates of our assets and liabilities, thereby reducing the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Finally, we have classified all of our investment portfolio as available-for-sale so as to provide flexibility in liquidity management. 
 
 We utilize a combination of analyses to monitor the Bank s exposure to changes in interest rates. The economic value of equity analysis is a model that estimates the change in net portfolio value NPV over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet contracts. In calculating changes in NPV, we assume estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates that seem most likely based on historical experience during prior interest rate changes.

Table of Contents 

Our net interest income analysis utilizes the data derived from the dynamic GAP analysis, described below, and applies several additional elements, including actual interest rate indices and margins, contractual limitations such as interest rate floors and caps and the U.S. Treasury yield curve as of the balance sheet date. In addition, we apply consistent parallel yield curve shifts (in both directions) to determine possible changes in net interest income if the theoretical yield curve shifts occurred instantaneously. Net interest income analysis also adjusts the dynamic GAP repricing analysis based on changes in prepayment rates resulting from the parallel yield curve shifts. 
 
 Our dynamic GAP analysis determines the relative balance between the repricing of assets and liabilities over multiple periods of time (ranging from overnight to five years). Dynamic GAP analysis includes expected cash flows from loans and mortgage-backed securities, applying prepayment rates based on the differential between the current interest rate and the market interest rate for each loan and security type. This analysis identifies mismatches in the timing of asset and liability repricing but does not necessarily provide an accurate indicator of interest rate risk because it omits the factors incorporated into the net interest income analysis. 
 
 Quantitative Analysis. The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the estimated changes in the Bank s NPV and net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel shift in the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.

The table set forth above indicates that at September 30, 2024, in the event of an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, the Bank would be expected to experience a 8.72 decrease in NPV and a 727,000 increase in net interest income. In the event of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates, the Bank would be expected to experience a 1.58 decrease in NPV and a 386,000 decrease in net interest income. This data does not reflect any actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates, such as changes in rates paid on certain deposit accounts based on local competitive factors, which could reduce the actual impact on NPV and net interest income, if any. 
 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in NPV and net interest income requires that we make certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The NPV and net interest income table presented above assumes that the composition of our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and, accordingly, the data does not reflect any actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates, such as changes in rates paid on certain deposit accounts based on local competitive factors. The table also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or the repricing characteristics of specific assets and liabilities. Because of the shortcomings mentioned above, management considers many additional factors such as projected changes in loan and deposit balances and various projected forward interest rate scenarios when evaluating strategies for managing interest rate risk. Accordingly, although the NPV and net interest income table provides an indication of our sensitivity to interest rate changes at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.
