 Impairment charge ) ) Balance at end of period Goodwill Balance at beginning of period Impairment charge Balance at end of period Due to the decline in the Company s projected cash flows, combined with a reduction in stock price, which represented a triggering event during the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company performed an interim impairment analysis of its franchise operating rights and goodwill. The Company did not identify a triggering event for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and as such, an interim impairment analysis was not necessary. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company had a triggering event that resulted in an interim impairment analysis of the franchise operating rights and goodwill which resulted in the recognition of non-cash impairment losses. Franchise Operating Rights Franchise operating rights are evaluated for impairment annually by comparing the carrying value of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods, at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which generally represent the markets in which the Company operates. Qualitative analysis is performed for franchise assets in the event the previous analysis indicates that there is a significant margin between the estimated fair value of franchise operating rights and the carrying value of those rights, and that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value equals or exceeds its carrying value. For any interim impairment analysis, all franchise operating rights were evaluated using quantitative analysis. The Company calculates the estimated fair value of franchise operating rights using the multi-period excess earnings method, an income approach, which calculates the estimated fair value of an intangible asset by discounting its future cash flows. The estimated fair value is determined based on discrete discounted future cash flows attributable to each franchise operating right intangible asset using assumptions consistent with internal forecasts. Assumptions key in estimating fair value under this method include, but are not limited to, revenue and subscriber growth rates (less anticipated customer churn), operating expenditures, capital expenditures (including any build out), market share achieved or market multiples, contributory asset charge rates, tax rates and a discount rate. The discount rate used in the model represents a weighted average cost of capital and the perceived risk associated with an intangible asset such as the Company s franchise operating rights. If the fair value of the franchise operating right asset is less than its carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset. As a result of the interim impairment analysis performed during the three months ended September 30, 2023, the estimated fair value of certain franchise operating right assets was determined to be below the carrying value, which resulted in the recognition of non-cash impairment losses. The Company also performed an interim impairment analysis for the three months ended June 30, 2023, which resulted in the recognition of non-cash impairment losses.

Table of Contents 
 Huntsville, AL Augusta, GA Montgomery, AL Charleston, SC Panama City, FL Valley, AL Knoxville, TN Newnan, GA Total The primary driver of the impairment charges was a decline in the estimated fair market value of indefinite-lived intangible assets in certain markets. The decline is primarily due to declining cash flows, which results in an increase in the discount rate used to estimate fair value, with the decline in the Company s common stock price. The impairment charges do not have an impact on the Company s intent and/or ability to renew or extend existing franchise operating rights. Goodwill For the interim impairment analysis, the Company quantitatively evaluated goodwill at the consolidated reporting unit level. The Company determined the estimated fair value utilizing a market approach that incorporated the approximate market capitalization as of the interim testing date, increased by the quoted market price of the Company s debt and adjusted for a control premium. Based on the interim analysis, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, the estimated fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value, as such, impairment charge related to goodwill was recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. There were no triggering events identified during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting in no need to perform an interim impairment analysis.

If it is deemed probable that the performance condition will be met, compensation cost will be recognized based on the closing price per share of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant multiplied by the number of awards expected to be earned. If it is deemed that it is not probable that the performance condition will be met, the Company will discontinue the recognition of compensation cost and any compensation cost previously recorded will be reversed.

 of customers. Priority Credit Agreement On October 11, 2024, the Company entered into a new super-priority credit agreement with existing lenders and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent and collateral agent (the Priority Credit Agreement ). The Priority Credit Agreement provides for (i) a million super-priority first out new money term loan (the First Out TL ), (ii) a super-senior second out term loan (the Second Out TL and (iii) a super-senior second out revolving credit facility (the Second Out RCF and together with the First Out TL and Second Out TL, the Super-senior Facility ). The Super-senior Facility is guaranteed by the same guarantors and collateral package as the Company s existing credit facility, and also contains certain collateral and guarantee enhancements. The Super-senior Facility provides that term loan lenders under the existing Credit Agreement that fund their pro rata share of the new money First Out TL are entitled to exchange their existing term loans under the existing Credit Agreement into the Priority Credit Agreement, with of such exchanged term loans to be included at par in the First Out TL (with such amounts incremental to the million amount outstanding under the First Out TL) and of the exchanged term loans at par into the Second Out TL. As of October 31, 2024, substantially all existing term loan lenders participated in the new money First Out TL, which resulted in an aggregate First Out TL of million (exclusive of PIK fees) and a Second Out TL of approximately million. In addition, to the extent that the Company s revolving lenders under the existing Credit Facility agree to provide covenant relief with respect to the springing leverage ratio under the existing Credit Agreement, such revolving lenders are entitled to exchange their revolving commitments at par into the Second Out RCF prior to November 1, 2024. The First Out TL matures in December 2028 (subject to a springing maturity of prior to the maturity of the revolving facility under the existing Credit Agreement) and bears interest at a rate equal to SOFR plus . In addition, the First Out TL contains capacity for an incremental million which may not be incurred prior to the first anniversary of the closing date of the Priority Credit Agreement. The Second Out TL matures in December 2028, and bears interest at a rate equal to SOFR plus . The Second Out RCF matures in December 2026 and initially bears interest at a rate equal to SOFR plus (subject to adjustment based on a grid). Both the First Out TL and Second Out TL require amortization payments of per annum. The Super-senior Facility contains certain (a) restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the entry into burdensome agreements, the prohibition of the incurrence of certain indebtedness, restrictions on the ability to make certain payments and to enter into certain merger, consolidation, asset sale and affiliate transactions, and (b) a springing secured net leverage ratio for the benefit only of the Second Out RCF lenders. The Priority Credit Agreement also contains representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default customary for an agreement of its type. As is customary, certain events of default could result in an acceleration of the Company s obligations under the Priority Credit Agreement.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are one of the nation s leading broadband providers offering an expansive portfolio of advanced services, including high-speed data HSD ), cable television Video ), and digital telephony Telephony services to residential customers and offer a full range of products and services to business customers. Our services are delivered across 16 markets via our efficient, advanced hybrid fiber-coax HFC network. Our footprint covers certain suburban areas within the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina and Tennessee. At September 30, 2024, our broadband networks passed nearly 2.0 million homes and businesses and served approximately 490,500 customers. Our core strategy is to provide outstanding service at affordable prices. We execute this strategy by managing our operations to focus on the customer. We believe that the customer experience should be reliable, easy and pleasantly surprising, every time. To achieve this customer experience, we operate one of the most technically advanced and high-performing networks in the industry. We operate under a broadband first strategy. Our advanced network offers HSD speeds up to 1.2 GIG (1200 Mbps) in approximately 99 of our footprint and HSD speeds up to 5 GIG (5000 Mbps) in our Greenfield expansion markets. Led by our robust HSD offering, our products are available either as an individual service or a bundle to residential and business service customers. Based on our per subscriber economics, we believe that HSD represents the greatest opportunity to enhance profitability across our residential and business markets. We continue to experience strong demand for our HSD service. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average percentage of HSD only new connections was approximately 94 , a 3 increase when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. However, there was a decline in customers purchasing higher speeds with approximately 71 of HSD only new connections purchasing 500MB or higher speeds during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an approximate 9 decrease when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. WOW is continuing to focus on its greenfield expansion strategy by building out its network in locations adjacent and nonadjacent to its existing network and bringing its state-of-the-art all IP fiber technology and award-winning customer service to those markets. As of September 30, 2024, WOW launched services in the communities of Altamonte Springs, Wekiwa Springs, Casselberry, Forest City, Longwood, Sanlando Springs, Lake Mary, Winter Springs, and Sanford, Florida as well as Headland, Alabama and Mauldin, South Carolina. Key Transactions Impacting Operating Results and Financial Condition Hurricane Helene In late September 2024, Hurricane Helene impacted the southeastern United States, resulting in damage to our network infrastructure and widespread power outages and service disruptions for customers in these markets. As a result, we issued service outage credits to impacted customers totaling 0.6 million as of September 30, 2024. For several weeks after the storm, a portion of our workforce has been dedicated to restoring services to our customers as quickly as possible. In the days since the hurricane, the Company has restored approximately 262 miles of network infrastructure and 71 of customers are back online and operational as of October 30, 2024, The Company recorded a 2.4 million loss related to the estimated write-down of damaged fixed assets at September 30, 2024 as a result of the storm.

 Hurricane Milton On October 10, 2024, the Company s network infrastructure in the Company s Florida markets were impacted by Hurricane Milton. The Company has assessed the damage in the impacted areas and does not believe this will have a material impact on the financial statements. The Company has restored approximately 35 miles of network infrastructure and 96 of customers are back online and operational as of October 30, 2024. Priority Credit Agreement On October 11, 2024, the Company closed on 200.0 million dollars of additional debt. See Note 15 Subsequent Event for the discussion of the additional debt through an incremental superpriority loan. Share Repurchase Program On October 4, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 50.0 million of our outstanding common stock. We completed our Share Repurchase Program in June 2023 with approximately 4.9 million shares purchased for 50.4 million (including commissions). Critical Accounting Estimates For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates and the means by which we develop estimates refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes from the critical estimates described in our Form 10-K. Homes Passed and Subscribers We report homes passed as the number of serviceable addresses, such as single residence homes, apartments and condominium units, and businesses passed by our broadband network and listed in our database. We report total subscribers as the number of subscribers who receive at least one of our HSD, Video or Telephony services, without regard to which or how many services they subscribe. We define each of the individual HSD subscribers, Video subscribers and Telephony subscribers as a revenue generating unit RGU ).

Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber information based on such reviews. Financial Statement Presentation Revenue Our operating revenue is primarily derived from monthly recurring charges for HSD, Video, Telephony and other business services to residential and business customers, in addition to other revenues. HSD revenue consists primarily of fixed monthly fees for data service and rental of modems. Video revenue consists primarily of fixed monthly fees for basic, premium and digital cable television services and rental of video converter equipment, as well as charges from optional services, such as pay-per-view, video-on-demand and other events available to the customer. The Company is required to pay certain cable franchising authorities an amount based on the percentage of gross revenue derived from video services. The Company generally passes these fees on to the customer, which are included in video revenue. Telephony revenue consists primarily of fixed monthly fees for local service and enhanced services, such as call waiting, voice mail and measured and flat rate long-distance service. Other business service revenue consists primarily of monthly recurring charges for session initiated protocol, web hosting, metro Ethernet, wireless backhaul, broadband carrier services and cloud infrastructure services provided to business customers. Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from line assurance warranty services provided to residential and business customers and revenue from paper statement fees, late fees and advertising placement. 
 Revenues attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our HSD, Video and Telephony services provided by our broadband networks were 92 and 93 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining percentage of total revenue represents non-subscription revenue primarily from other business services, paper statement fees, late fees, line assurance warranty services and advertising placement. Costs and Expenses Our expenses primarily consist of operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense. 

 22 

Table of Contents 
 Operating expenses primarily include programming costs, data costs, transport costs and network access fees related to our HSD, Video and Telephony services, hardware/software expenses, network operations and maintenance services, customer service and call center expenses, bad debt, billing and collection expenses and franchise and other regulatory fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and benefits of corporate and field management, sales and marketing personnel, human resources and related administrative costs. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of our network infrastructure, including associated equipment, hardware and software, buildings and leasehold improvements, and finance lease obligations. Amortization is recognized on other intangible assets with definite lives, primarily related to acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization expense is presented separately from operating and selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. We control our costs of operations by maintaining strict controls on expenditures. More specifically, we are focused on managing our cost structure by improving workforce productivity, increasing the effectiveness of our purchasing activities and maintaining discipline in customer acquisition. We expect programming expenses to continue to increase per Video subscriber due to a variety of factors, including increased demands by owners of some broadcast stations for carriage of other services or payments to those broadcasters for retransmission consent and annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation. We have not been able to fully pass these increases on to our customers without the loss of customers, nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future. Results of Operations The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented:

 Revenue Total revenue for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 15.1 million and 39.6 million, or 9 and 8 , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 as follows: 

Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in millions) Residential subscription 117.4 132.1 356.9 395.9 Business subscription 28.6 28.2 84.6 84.2 Total subscription 146.0 160.3 441.5 480.1 Other business services 4.5 5.4 14.8 15.7 Other 7.5 7.4 22.0 22.1 Total revenue 158.0 173.1 478.3 517.9 Subscription Revenue Total subscription revenue decreased 14.3 million, or 9 , and 38.6 million, or 8 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The decreases were primarily driven by a 13.4 million and 38.2 million shift in service offering mix, respectively, as we experience a reduction across all RGUs, and a 6.0 million and 18.8 million decrease in volume across all services. These decreases were partially offset by a 5.1 million and 18.4 million increase in average revenue per unit ARPU ), respectively, due to rate increases issued in the first quarter and third quarter of 2024. The increase in ARPU for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is partially offset by the 0.6 million of revenue credits issued to customers in those markets impacted by Hurricane Helene. ARPU is calculated as subscription revenue for each of the HSD, Video and Telephony services divided by the average total RGUs for each service category for the respective period. Other Business Services Other business services revenue decreased 0.9 million, or 17 , and 0.9 million, or 6 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decreases are primarily due to decreases in wholesale and data center revenue. Other Revenue Other revenue increased 0.1 million, or 1 , and decreased 0.1 million, or 0 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase is primarily due to increases in advertising revenue, partially offset by a decrease in paper statement fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in line assurance revenue, advertising revenue, shopping revenue, and service call fee revenue, partially offset by increases in paper statement fees and streaming partner revenue. Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased 13.0 million, or 17 , and 34.6 million, or 15 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decreases are primarily driven by reduction in direct operating expenses, specifically programming expenses of 9.2 million and of 27.2 million, respectively, which aligns with the reduction in Video RGUs between periods, as well as decreases in call center costs, stock compensation and bad debt expenses, partially offset by increases in compensation related expenses.

 Incremental contribution Incremental contribution is defined as subscription services revenue less costs directly incurred from third parties in connection with the provision of such services to our customers (service direct expense). Incremental contribution decreased 5.0 million, or 4 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and 12.5 million, or 3 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See non-GAAP discussion below. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.4 million, or 1 , and decreased 54.5 million, or 33 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in legal and professional fees partially offset by reductions in marketing expenses and stock compensation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in patent litigation expense, marketing expense stock compensation expenses and transition service agreement expenses, partially offset by increases in legal and professional fees. The transition service agreement ended in the second quarter 2023. Depreciation and amortization expenses Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 5.8 million, or 12 , and 18.7 million, or 13 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increases are primarily due to increases of equipment placed into service as we continue to expand our network. Included in depreciation and amortization expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is the loss of 2.4 million related to the estimated write-down of fixed assets damaged as a result of Hurricane Helene. Impairment losses on intangibles The Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge related to its franchise operating rights of 131.7 million and 259.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The charge was primarily related to declining cash flows, which resulted in an increase in the discount rate, combined with a decline in the Company s common stock price. The Company did not recognize such charges for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 5 Franchising Operating Rights and Goodwill for discussion of non-cash impairment charge. Interest expense Interest expense increased 12.7 million, or 67 , and 19.3 million, or 38 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increases are primarily due to higher overall debt balances, and entrance into five interest rate derivative instruments during the first quarter of 2024. The change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is presented in interest expense each period.

 Other income Other income increased 0.5 million and decreased 1.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. While the three months ended September 30, 2024 was relatively flat, the decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the decline in services provided as part of the transition services agreements under which the Company was providing post-transaction continuity of service to the two different buyers of our sold service areas during the transition periods. The agreements with both buyers ended in 2023. Income tax expense We reported an income tax benefit of 6.5 million and 10.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective tax rates were primarily impacted by the increase in valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, and disallowed executive compensation expense. We reported an income tax benefit of 35.6 million and 84.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The change in income tax benefit year over year is primarily related to decreased income caused by impairment charges on intangibles in fiscal year 2023. Use of Incremental Contribution Incremental contribution is included herein because we believe that it is a key metric used by our management to assess the financial performance of the business by showing how the relative relationship of the various components of subscription services contributes to our overall consolidated historical results. Our management further believes that it provides useful information to investors in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations because the additional detail illustrates how an incremental dollar of revenue generates cash, before any unallocated costs are considered, which we believe is a key component of our overall strategy and important for understanding what drives our cash flow position relative to our historical results. Incremental contribution is defined by us as the components of subscription revenue, less costs directly incurred from third parties in connection with the provision of such services to our customers. Incremental contribution is not made in accordance with GAAP and our use of the term incremental contribution varies from others in our industry. Incremental contribution should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, consolidated net income (loss) and operating income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or operating cash flows, or as measures of liquidity. Incremental contribution has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP as it does not identify or allocate any other operating costs and expenses that are components of our income from operations to specific subscription revenues as we do not measure or record such costs and expenses in a manner that would allow attribution to a specific component of subscription revenue. Accordingly, incremental contribution should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or operating cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.

 The following tables provide a reconciliation of incremental contribution to income from operations, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods presented: 

Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in millions) Income (loss) from operations 2.3 (121.1) 11.2 (279.4) Revenue (excluding subscription revenue) (12.0) (12.8) (36.8) (37.8) Other non-allocated operating expense (excluding depreciation and amortization) 37.8 41.5 112.4 120.9 Selling, general and administrative 37.9 37.5 112.1 166.6 Depreciation and amortization 55.2 49.4 160.3 141.6 Impairment losses on intangibles 131.7 259.8 Incremental contribution 121.2 126.2 359.2 371.7 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary funding requirements are for our ongoing operations, capital expenditures, outstanding debt obligations, including lease agreements, and strategic investments. At September 30, 2024, the principal amount of our outstanding consolidated debt aggregated to 973.0 million, of which 17.9 million is classified as current in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of such date. As of September 30, 2024, we had borrowing capacity of 0.4 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. On October 11, 2024, the Company closed on a 200.0 million new super-priority term loan. We continue to strategically managing our cash by decreasing our spending on discretionary capital and expenses. We are required to prepay principal amounts if we generate excess cash flow, as defined in the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we had 21.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our existing cash balances and operating cash flows will provide sufficient resources to fund our obligations and anticipated liquidity requirements over the next 12 months. We expect to utilize cash flow from operations and cash on hand as funding sources, as well as the proceeds from our super-priority term loan to fund our greenfield expansion initiatives. We may also potentially engage in future financing transactions to further extend the maturities of our debt obligations. The timing and terms of any financing transactions will be subject to market conditions among other considerations. As potential acquisitions or dispositions arise, we actively review such transactions against our objectives including, among other considerations, improving our operational efficiency, geographic clustering of assets, product development or technology capabilities of our business and achieving appropriate strategic objectives, and we may participate in such transactions to the extent we believe these possibilities present attractive opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that we will actually complete any acquisitions or dispositions, or that any such transactions will be material to our operations or results. Our ability to fund operations, make capital expenditures, repay debt obligations and make future acquisitions and strategic investments depends on future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Historical Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was 132.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 90.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to the increase in operating income, combined with the timing differences of our receivables and payables, partially offset by the increase in interest paid.

Table of Contents 
 Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was 163.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 188.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We have ongoing capital expenditure requirements related to the maintenance, expansion and technological upgrades of our network. Capital expenditures are funded primarily through a combination of cash on hand cash flow from operations, and in future periods will include cash proceeds from our super-priority credit agreement. Our capital expenditures were 164.1 million and 188.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following table sets forth additional information regarding our capital expenditures for the periods presented: 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Capital Expenditures Scalable infrastructure(1) 58.2 44.7 Customer premise equipment(2) 54.4 48.3 Support capital and other(3) 26.6 38.2 Line extensions(4) 24.9 57.1 Total 164.1 188.3 Capital expenditures included in total related to: Greenfields(5) 59.8 71.2 Edge-outs(6) 4.9 10.0 Business services(7) 10.5 10.4 

 (1) Scalable infrastructure includes costs, not directly related to customer acquisition activity, to support new customer growth and provide service enhancements (e.g., headend equipment). (2) Customer premise equipment, or CPE, includes equipment and installation costs incurred to deliver services to residential and business services customers. CPE includes the costs of acquiring and installing our set-top boxes and modems, as well as the cost of customer connections to our network. (3) Support capital and other includes costs to modify or replace existing HFC network, including enhancements, and all other costs to support day-to-day operations, including land, buildings, vehicles, office equipment, tools and test equipment. (4) Line extensions include costs associated with new home development including edge-outs and greenfields (e.g., fiber / coaxial cable, amplifiers, electronic equipment, make-ready and design engineering). (5) Greenfields represent costs associated with building our fiber technology network in locations non-adjacent to our existing network. (6) Edge-outs represent costs to extend our network into new adjacent service areas, including the associated CPE. (7) Business services represent costs associated with the build-out of our network to support business services customers, including the associated CPE. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 29.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 89.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in amounts drawn from our revolving credit facility during the period and a reduction in purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by the reduction in share repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk is limited and primarily related to fluctuating interest rates associated with our variable rate indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, borrowings under our Term B Loans and Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at SOFR plus 3.00 and SOFR plus 2.75 , respectively. We manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and operating cash flows by entering into derivative instruments to protect against increases in the interest rates on our variable rate debt. We use interest rate swaps, where we receive variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments. As of September 30, 2024, after considering our interest rate swaps, approximately 46 of our Senior Secured Credit Facility is still variable rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point (1 change in SOFR interest rates (based on the interest rates in effect under our Senior Secured Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024) would result in an annual interest expense change of up to approximately 4.5 million on our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of the Certifying Officers, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, as the result of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Notwithstanding this material weakness, management has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

 Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that existed at December 31, 2023. The material weakness described below did not result in a misstatement of the Company s annual or interim consolidated financial statements. Specifically, management did not design and maintain effective information technology general controls over certain systems that support the revenue recognition process for subscription services. Additionally, management did not design and maintain effective review controls over the completeness and accuracy of information produced by those systems. This material weakness continued to exist at September 30, 2024. Remediation Plan Management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. In response to the material weakness identified above, management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has developed several new controls and is in process of implementing new controls as well as testing existing and newly developed controls. The new controls are designed to provide appropriate segregation of duties and monitoring over certain systems that support the revenue recognition process for subscription services. Additionally, these controls will provide further assurance over the completeness and accuracy of information generated from these systems. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting With the exception of the controls developed and implemented in response to the material weakness identified above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the third quarter of 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
