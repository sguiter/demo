 segments: Insurance and Asset Management. The Company separately reports the results of its Corporate division and the effects of consolidating FG VIEs and CIVs. This presentation is consistent with the manner in which the Company s CODM reviews the business to assess performance and allocate resources. 
 
 The Company analyzes the operating performance of each segment using segment adjusted operating income (loss). Results for each segment include specifically identifiable expenses as well as intersegment expense allocations, as applicable, based on time studies and other cost allocation methodologies based on headcount or other metrics. Segment adjusted operating income is defined as net income (loss) attributable to AGL, adjusted for the following items, which primarily affect the Insurance segment and Corporate division: 
 
 Elimination of realized gains (losses) on the Company s investments, except for gains and losses on securities classified as trading. 
 Elimination of non-credit impairment-related unrealized fair value gains (losses) on credit derivatives that are recognized in net income, which is the amount of unrealized fair value gains (losses) in excess of the present value of the expected estimated economic credit losses, and non-economic payments. 
 Elimination of fair value gains (losses) on the Company s committed capital securities (CCS) that are recognized in net income. 
 Elimination of foreign exchange gains (losses) on remeasurement of net premium receivables and loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) reserves that are recognized in net income. 
 The tax effects related to the above adjustments, which are determined by applying the statutory tax rate in each of the jurisdictions that generate these adjustments. 
 
 In addition to the adjustments listed above, the adjusted operating income (loss) segment measure differs from GAAP in other respects. The Insurance segment includes: (i) premiums and losses from the financial guaranty insurance policies issued by the U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries that guarantee the FG VIEs debt; and (ii) the insurance subsidiaries share of earnings from investments in funds managed by Sound Point (prior to July 1, 2023, AssuredIM) and AHP funds in equity in earnings (losses) of investees. Under GAAP, (i) FG VIEs are consolidated by the U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries and the premiums and losses/recoveries associated with the financial guaranty policies in respect of the FG VIEs debt are eliminated (the reconciliation tables below present the FG VIEs and related eliminations in other and (ii) certain alternative investments are accounted for as CIVs, which are consolidated by either AGUS or AGAS (in the reconciliation tables below, the CIVs and related

 BIG surveillance categories below, which generally represent the following: 
 
 BIG 1: Below-investment-grade exposures for which there are possible losses, on a present value basis, and the aggregate probability weighting of scenarios with losses is less than . 
 BIG 2: Below-investment-grade exposures for which there are possible losses, on a present value basis, and the aggregate probability weighting of scenarios with losses is at least , but for which no claims (other than claims that the Company expects to be reimbursed within have yet been paid. 
 BIG 3: Below-investment-grade exposures for which losses are expected, on a present value basis, and the aggregate probability weighting of scenarios with losses is at least , and for which claims have been paid that the Company does not expect to be reimbursed within one year. 
 
 For purposes of classifying BIG exposures into one of the three BIG categories, the Company calculates the present value of projected claim payments and recoveries using the pre-tax book yield of the relevant insurance subsidiary s investment portfolio as the applicable discount rate. 
 
 As discussed in Note 4, Expected Loss to be Paid (Recovered), for financial statement measurement purposes, the Company uses risk-free rates (as determined each quarter) for discounting, rather than pre-tax book yield of the investment portfolio, to calculate the expected losses to be paid. Expected losses to be paid (recovered) are based on probability weighted scenarios and serve as the basis for the loss reserves reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Financial Guaranty Exposure 
 
 The Company measures its financial guaranty exposure in terms of (i) gross and net par outstanding and (ii) gross and net debt service. 
 
 The Company typically guarantees the payment of debt service when due. Since most of these payments are due in the future, the Company generally uses gross and net par outstanding as a proxy for its financial guaranty exposure. Gross par outstanding generally represents the principal amount of the insured obligation at a point in time. Net par outstanding equals gross par outstanding net of any reinsurance. The Company includes in its par outstanding calculation the impact of any consumer price index inflator to the reporting date as well as, in the case of accreting (zero-coupon) obligations, accretion to the reporting date. Non-U.S. dollar denominated par outstanding is translated at the spot rate at the end of the reporting period.

 billion attributable to Loss Mitigation Securities. 
 
 Gross debt service outstanding represents the sum of all estimated future debt service payments on the insured obligations, on an undiscounted basis. Net debt service outstanding equals gross debt service outstanding net of any reinsurance. Future debt service payments include the estimated impact of any consumer price index inflator after the reporting date as well as, in the case of accreting (zero-coupon) obligations, accretion after the reporting date. 
 
 The Company calculates its debt service outstanding as follows: 
 
 for insured obligations that are not supported by homogeneous pools of assets (which category includes most of the Company s public finance transactions), as the total estimated contractual future debt service due through maturity, regardless of whether the obligations may be called and regardless of whether, in the case of obligations where principal payments are due when an underlying asset makes a principal payment, the Company believes the obligations will be repaid prior to contractual maturity; and 
 
 for insured obligations that are supported by homogeneous pools of assets that are contractually permitted to prepay principal (which category includes, for example, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS)), as the total estimated expected future debt service due on insured obligations through their respective expected terms, which reflects the Company s expectations as to whether the obligations may be called and, in the case of obligations where principal payments are due when an underlying asset makes a principal payment, when the Company expects principal payments to be made prior to contractual maturity. 
 
 The calculation of debt service requires the use of estimates, which the Company updates periodically, including estimates and assumptions for the expected remaining term of insured obligations supported by homogeneous pools of assets, updated interest rates for floating and variable rate insured obligations, behavior of consumer price indices for obligations with consumer price index inflators, foreign exchange rates and other assumptions based on the characteristics of each insured obligation. Debt service is a measure of the estimated maximum potential exposure to insured obligations before considering the Company s various legal rights to the underlying collateral and other remedies available to it under its financial guaranty contract. 
 
 Actual debt service may differ from estimated debt service due to refundings, terminations, negotiated restructurings, prepayments, changes in interest rates on variable rate insured obligations, consumer price index behavior differing from that projected, changes in foreign exchange rates on non-U.S. dollar denominated insured obligations and other factors.

 PREPA 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s net par outstanding on insured PREPA obligations was million and million, respectively. The PREPA bonds are secured by a lien on the net revenues of the electric system. 
 
 The default of PREPA s obligations has been the subject of restructuring negotiations, mediation and litigation since 2014. On April 8, 2022, the United States District Court of the District of Puerto Rico (Federal District Court of Puerto Rico) issued an order appointing three U.S. Bankruptcy Judges as members of a PREPA mediation team. The Federal District Court of Puerto Rico also entered a separate order establishing the terms and conditions of mediation. The Financial Oversight and Management Board (the FOMB) which was established under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) filed an initial plan of adjustment and disclosure statement for PREPA with the Federal District Court of Puerto Rico on December 16, 2022. 
 
 On March 22, 2023, the Federal District Court of Puerto Rico held that the PREPA bondholders had perfected liens only in revenues that had been deposited in the sinking fund established under the PREPA trust agreement and related funds over which the bond trustee had control but did not have a lien on future revenues until deposited in those funds. The Federal District Court of Puerto Rico also held, however, that PREPA bondholders do have recourse under the PREPA trust agreement in the form of an unsecured net revenue claim. At that time, the Federal District Court of Puerto Rico declined to value the unsecured net revenue claim or the method for its determination. The ultimate value of the claim, according to the Federal District Court of Puerto Rico, should be determined through a claim estimation proceeding. 
 
 On June 26, 2023 the Federal District Court of Puerto Rico issued an opinion and order estimating the unsecured net revenue claim to be billion as of July 3, 2017. Subject to their appeal of the Federal District Court of Puerto Rico s ruling on the scope of lien, PREPA bondholders had sought an unsecured net revenue claim of approximately billion. 
 
 On November 17, 2023, the Federal District Court of Puerto Rico approved the supplemental disclosure statement (Supplemental Disclosure Statement) supporting the PREPA plan of adjustment filed by the FOMB (as amended or modified from time to time). On February 16, 2024, the FOMB filed with the Federal District Court of Puerto Rico its most recent plan of adjustment for PREPA, the Modified Fourth Amended Title III Plan of Adjustment (FOMB PREPA Plan). The Supplemental Disclosure Statement and the FOMB PREPA Plan are based on the last revised PREPA fiscal plan certified by the FOMB on June 23, 2023. The confirmation hearing for the FOMB PREPA Plan occurred in March 2024. At the end of the hearing, the Federal District Court of Puerto Rico stated that it was taking the confirmation of the FOMB PREPA Plan under advisement and gave no indication of timing for an opinion or order.

 stay of all FOMB PREPA Plan litigation. On October 29, 2024, the Federal District Court of Puerto Rico extended the term of mediation and the litigation stay through January 31, 2025. 
 
 Resolved Puerto Rico Exposures 
 
 In 2022, as a result of the resolution of the Company s exposure to insured Puerto Rico credits experiencing payment default other than PREPA (2022 Puerto Rico Resolutions), the Company received cash, new general obligation bonds (New GO Bonds), new bonds backed by toll revenues (Toll Bonds, and together with New GO Bonds, New Recovery Bonds) and contingent value instruments (CVIs). The CVIs are intended to provide creditors with additional recoveries tied to the outperformance of the Puerto Rico 5.5 Sales and Use Tax receipts against May 2020 certified fiscal plan projections, subject to annual and lifetime caps. Cash, New Recovery Bonds and CVIs received pursuant to the 2022 Puerto Rico Resolutions are collectively referred to as Plan Consideration. As of September 30, 2024, all but million of the CVIs (at fair value), and substantially all of the New Recovery Bonds had been sold or redeemed. As of September 30, 2024, remaining CVIs are reported in fixed-maturity securities, trading. See Note 7, Investments. The Company may sell in the future any CVIs it continues to hold. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had million and million of insured net par outstanding of legacy PRHTA bonds, respectively. This net par outstanding primarily represents the Company s exposure in respect of legacy insured PRHTA bondholders who elected to receive custody receipts that represent an interest in the legacy insurance policy plus Plan Consideration, as described below. The remaining amounts owed for insured PRHTA bonds are payable in full by the Company s insurance subsidiaries under their financial guaranty policies and are no longer dependent on the credit of PRHTA. The Company consolidates the trusts in which the PRHTA financial guaranty policies are reported. See Note 8, Financial Guaranty Variable Interest Entities and Consolidated Investment Vehicles. 
 
 Certain insured bondholders elected to receive custody receipts representing an interest in custodial trusts that hold the legacy insurance policy plus Plan Consideration that were reported in FG VIEs assets at the time of the receipt. The Company s insurance policy continues to guarantee principal and interest coming due on the legacy insured bonds in accordance with the terms of such insurance policy on the originally scheduled legacy bond interest and principal payment dates. 
 
 Non-Defaulting Puerto Rico Exposures 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had million and million, respectively, of remaining non-defaulting Puerto Rico net par outstanding related primarily to the MFA. The MFA exposures are secured by a lien on local tax revenues and remain current on debt service payments. 
 
 Puerto Rico Litigation 
 
 Currently, there are numerous legal actions relating to the default by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain of its instrumentalities on debt service payments, and related matters, and the Company is a party to a number of them. The Company has taken legal action, and may take additional legal action in the future, to enforce its rights with respect to the remaining Puerto Rico obligations it still insures. In addition, the Commonwealth, the FOMB and others have taken legal action naming the Company as party.

 Public Finance 
 
 The largest components of the public finance net expected losses to be paid (recovered), based on the probability weighting of its scenarios, relate to certain Puerto Rico, healthcare and U.K. regulated utilities exposures. See Note 3, Outstanding Exposure, for a discussion of Puerto Rico exposures, and Note 8, Financial Guaranty Variable Interest Entities and Consolidated Investment Vehicles, for a discussion of the Puerto Rico Trusts. 
 
 Certain BIG healthcare exposures are experiencing rising labor costs due to competition for labor and shortages in certain markets. Additionally, inflation has increased the cost of medical supplies, medical equipment, and pharmacy products, while hospitals with large Medicaid and Medicare payor mixes have not seen reimbursement levels keep pace with rising costs. The combined revenue and expense challenges have led to cash flow and liquidity stress in certain transactions. In addition, certain credits are struggling to make necessary capital expenditures and improvements to facilities. 
 
 In third quarter 2024, the Company internally downgraded to BIG certain U.K regulated utilities and European renewable energy transactions that are experiencing operational strain, high financing costs and other capital constraints. 
 
 The total net expected loss to be paid for U.S. public finance exposures is net of expected recoveries related to certain claims already paid. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, that assumed future recovery was million and million, respectively. 
 
 The Company s net expected losses to be paid (recovered) incorporate management s probability weighted estimates of all possible scenarios. Economic loss development for public finance transactions in third quarter 2024 and nine months 2024 was primarily attributable to certain U.K. regulated utilities and Puerto Rico exposures, offset in part by improvements in certain healthcare exposures. 
 
 U.S. RMBS Loss Projections 
 
 The Company projects losses on its insured U.S. RMBS on a transaction-by-transaction basis by projecting the performance of the underlying pool of mortgages over time and then applying the structural features (e.g., payment priorities and tranching) of the RMBS and any expected representation and warranty recoveries/payables to the projected performance of the collateral over time. The resulting projected claim payments or reimbursements are then discounted using risk-free rates. 
 
 Each period the Company reviews the assumptions it uses to make RMBS loss projections with consideration of updates on the performance of its insured transactions (including early-stage delinquencies, late-stage delinquencies and loss severity) as well as the residential property market and economy in general. To the extent it observes changes, it makes a judgment as to whether those changes are normal fluctuations or part of a more prolonged trend. ) ) ) Second lien U.S. RMBS ) ) ) ) 

First Lien U.S. RMBS Loss Projections: Alt-A, Prime, Option ARM and Subprime 
 
 The majority of projected losses in first lien U.S. RMBS transactions are expected to come from non-performing mortgage loans (those that are or have recently been or more payments behind, have been modified, are in foreclosure, or have been foreclosed upon). Changes in the amount of non-performing loans from the amount projected in the previous period are one of the primary drivers of loss projections in this portfolio. Collateral losses are projected to be offset by recoveries on

 ____________________ 
 (1) The ranges represent variation in calculated liquidation rates across RMBS sectors. 
 
 While the Company uses the liquidation rates above to project defaults of non-performing loans (including current loans that were recently modified or delinquent), it projects defaults on presently current loans by applying a conditional default rate (CDR) curve. The start of that CDR curve is based on the defaults the Company projects will emerge from currently nonperforming, recently nonperforming and modified loans. The total amount of expected defaults from the non-performing loans is translated into a constant CDR (i.e., the CDR plateau), which, if applied for each of the next months, results in the projection of the defaults that are expected to emerge from the various delinquency categories. The CDR thus calculated individually on the delinquent collateral pool for each RMBS is then used as the starting point for the CDR curve used to project defaults of the presently performing loans. 
 
 In the most heavily weighted scenario (the base scenario), after the -month CDR plateau period, each transaction s CDR is projected to improve over months to a final CDR of of the CDR plateau. In the base scenario, the Company assumes the final CDR will be reached after the -month CDR plateau period. Under the Company s methodology, defaults projected to occur in the first months represent defaults that can be attributed to loans that were recently modified or delinquent, or that are currently delinquent or in foreclosure, while the defaults projected to occur using the projected CDR trend after the first -month period represent defaults attributable to borrowers that are currently performing or are projected to re-perform. 
 
 Another important driver of loss projections is loss severity, which is the amount of loss the transaction incurs on a loan after the application of net proceeds from the disposal of the underlying property. The Company assumes in the base scenario that recent (still historically elevated) loss severities will improve after loans with accumulated delinquencies and foreclosure cost are liquidated. The Company is assuming in the base scenario that recent severity levels generally will continue for another months. The Company determines its initial loss severity based on recent experience. Each quarter, the Company reviews available data and (if necessary) adjusts its severities based on its observations. The Company then assumes that loss severities begin returning to levels consistent with underwriting assumptions beginning after the initial -month period, trending to in the base scenario over years. 
 
 The Company incorporates a recovery assumption into its loss modeling to reflect observed trends in recoveries of deferred principal balances of modified first lien loans that had been previously written off. For transactions where the Company has detailed loan information, the Company assumes that a percentage of the deferred loan balances will eventually be recovered upon sale of the collateral or refinancing of the loans. In third quarter 2024, due to observed trends and high levels of home equity, the Company increased its scenario-based recovery assumptions such that the weighted average recovery percentage increased from to approximately . The effect of these updated assumptions on expected losses was a benefit of million.

 - - Final CDR - - Initial loss severity - Future recovery for deferred principal balances 
 
 The rate at which the principal amount of loans is voluntarily prepaid may impact both the amount of losses projected (since that amount is a function of the CDR, the loss severity and the loan balance over time) as well as the amount of excess spread (the amount by which the interest paid by the borrowers on the underlying loan exceeds the amount of interest owed on the insured obligations). The assumption for the voluntary conditional prepayment rate (CPR) follows a pattern similar to that of the CDR. The current level of voluntary prepayments is assumed to continue for the plateau period before gradually increasing over months to the final CPR, which is assumed to be in the base scenario. For transactions where the initial CPR is higher than the final CPR, the initial CPR is held constant and the final CPR is not used. These CPR assumptions are the same as those the Company used for December 31, 2023. 
 
 Certain transactions benefit from excess spread when they are supported by large portions of fixed rate assets (either originally fixed or modified to be fixed) but have insured floating rate debt linked to the Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR). An increase in projected SOFR decreases excess spread, while lower SOFR projections result in higher excess spread. 
 
 In estimating expected losses, the Company modeled and probability weighted sensitivities for first lien U.S. RMBS transactions by varying its assumptions of how fast a recovery is expected to occur. One of the variables used to model sensitivities was how quickly the CDR returned to its modeled equilibrium, which was defined as of the CDR plateau. The Company also stressed CPR and the speed of recovery of loss severity rates. The Company probability weighted a total of scenarios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company used a similar approach to establish its scenarios as of September 30, 2024 as it used as of December 31, 2023, increasing and decreasing the periods and levels of stress from those used in the base scenario. In the Company s most stressful scenario where of deferred principal balances are assumed to be recovered, loss severities experience stress for and the initial ramp-down of the CDR was assumed to occur over months, expected loss to be paid would increase from current projections by approximately million for all first lien U.S. RMBS transactions. In the Company s least stressful scenario where of deferred principal balances are assumed to be recovered, the CDR plateau was shorter months, effectively assuming that liquidation rates would improve) and the CDR recovery was more pronounced (including an initial ramp-down of the CDR over ), expected loss to be paid would decrease from current projections by approximately million for all first lien U.S. RMBS transactions. 
 
 Second Lien U.S. RMBS Loss Projections 
 
 Second lien U.S. RMBS transactions include both home equity lines of credit (HELOC) and closed end second lien mortgages. The Company believes the primary variable affecting its expected losses in second lien U.S. RMBS transactions is the amount and timing of future losses or recoveries in the collateral pool supporting the transactions (including recoveries from previously charged-off loans). Expected losses are also a function of the structure of the transaction, the prepayment speeds of the collateral, the interest rate environment and assumptions about loss severity. 
 
 The Company estimates the amount of loans that will default over the next several years by first calculating expected liquidation rates for delinquent loans, and applying liquidation rates to currently delinquent loans in order to arrive at an expected dollar amount of defaults from currently delinquent collateral (plateau period defaults). 
 
 Similar to the methodology applied to first lien U.S. RMBS transactions, the Company then calculates a CDR that will cause the targeted amount of liquidations to occur during the plateau period.

 months. Once the plateau period ends, the CDR is assumed to trend down in uniform increments for to its final long-term steady state CDR of original plateau). 
 
 HELOC loans generally permit the borrower to pay only interest for an initial period (often and, after that period, require the borrower to make both the monthly interest payment and a monthly principal payment. This causes the borrower's total monthly payment to increase, sometimes substantially, at the end of the initial interest-only period. A substantial number of loans in the Company s insured transactions had been modified to extend the interest-only period to years. The majority of the modified loans have reset to full amortization. 
 
 The Company has observed the performance of the modified loans that have finally reset to full amortization and noted low levels of delinquency, even with substantial increases in monthly payments. This observed performance lowers the level of uncertainty regarding this modified cohort. 
 
 When a second lien loan defaults, there is generally a low recovery. The Company assumed, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, that it will generally recover of future defaulting collateral at the time of charge-off, with additional amounts of post charge-off recoveries projected to come in over time. A second lien on the borrower s home may be retained in the Company s second lien transactions after the loan is charged off and the loss applied to the transaction, particularly in cases where the holder of the first lien has not foreclosed. If the second lien is retained and the value of the home increases, the servicer may be able to use the second lien to increase recoveries, either by arranging for the borrower to resume payments or by realizing value upon the sale of the underlying real estate. The Company evaluates its assumptions quarterly based on actual recoveries of charged-off loans observed from period to period and reasonable expectations of future recoveries. In instances where the Company is able to obtain information on the lien status of charged-off loans, it assumes there will be a certain level of future recoveries of the balance of the charged-off loans where the second lien is still intact. During third quarter 2024, due to observed trends and high levels of home equity, the Company updated its assumptions of such recoveries to reflect a base scenario, and a weighted average, recovery of , up from , which resulted in a benefit of million. Such recoveries are assumed to be received evenly over the next . 
 
 The rate at which the principal amount of loans is prepaid may impact both the amount of losses projected as well as the amount of excess spread. In the base scenario, an average CPR (based on experience of the past year) is assumed to continue until the end of the plateau before gradually increasing to the final CPR over the same period the CDR decreases. The final CPR is assumed to be for second lien U.S. RMBS transactions (in the base scenario), which is lower than the historical average but reflects the Company s continued uncertainty about the projected performance of the borrowers in these transactions. For transactions where the initial CPR is higher than the final CPR, the initial CPR is held constant and the final CPR is not used. This pattern is consistent with how the Company modeled the CPR as of December 31, 2023. To the extent that prepayments differ from projected levels, the Company s projected excess spread and losses could materially change. 
 
 In estimating expected losses, the Company modeled and probability weighted scenarios, each with a different CDR curve applicable to the period preceding the return to the long-term steady state CDR. The Company believes that the level of the elevated CDR and the length of time it will persist, the ultimate prepayment rate and recoveries for charged-off loans are the primary drivers of the amount of losses the collateral will likely suffer.

 - - Final CDR - - Liquidation rates: Current but recently delinquent 30 59 Days Delinquent 60 89 Days Delinquent 90+ Days Delinquent Bankruptcy Foreclosure Real Estate Owned Loss severity on future defaults Projected future recoveries on previously charged-off loans 
 
 The Company continues to evaluate the assumptions affecting its modeling results. The Company believes the most important driver of its projected second lien U.S. RMBS losses is the performance of its HELOC transactions. 
 
 The Company used a similar approach to establish its scenarios as of September 30, 2024 as it used as of December 31, 2023. The Company modeled scenarios with a longer period of elevated defaults and others with a shorter period of elevated defaults as well as various levels of assumed recoveries. In the Company s most stressful scenario, assuming recoveries on charged-off loans, increasing the CDR plateau to months and increasing the ramp-down by to months (for a total stress period of months) would decrease the expected recovery by approximately million for HELOC transactions. On the other hand, in the Company s least stressful scenario, assuming recoveries on charged-off loans, reducing the CDR plateau to months and decreasing the length of the CDR ramp-down to (for a total stress period of months) and lowering the ultimate prepayment rate to would increase the expected recovery by approximately million for HELOC transactions. 
 
 Recovery Litigation and Dispute Resolution 
 
 In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, certain of AGL s subsidiaries are involved in litigation or other dispute resolution with third parties to recover insurance losses paid or return benefits received in prior periods or prevent or reduce losses in the future. The impact, if any, of these and other proceedings on the amount of recoveries the Company ultimately receives and losses it pays in the future is uncertain, and the impact of any one or more of these proceedings during any quarter or year could be material to the Company s financial statements. 
 
 The Company has asserted claims in a number of legal proceedings in connection with its exposure to Puerto Rico. See Note 3, Outstanding Exposure, for a discussion of the Company s exposure to Puerto Rico and related recovery litigation being pursued by the Company.

 The impact of changes in credit spreads will vary based upon the volume, tenor, interest rates and other market conditions at the time these fair values are determined. In addition, since each transaction has unique collateral and structural terms, the change in fair value of each transaction may vary considerably. The fair value of credit derivative contracts generally also reflects the Company s own credit cost based on the price to purchase credit protection on AG. The Company determines its own credit risk primarily based on quoted CDS prices traded on AG at each balance sheet date.

 The fair value of CDS contracts as of September 30, 2024, before considering the benefit applicable to AG s credit spread, is a direct result of the relatively wider credit spreads under current market conditions, sometimes related to downgrades, compared with those at the time of underwriting for certain underlying credits with longer tenor.

 The Company considered the credit quality, cash flows, interest rate movements, ability to hold a security to recovery and intent to sell a security in determining whether a security had a credit loss. The Company has determined that the unrealized losses recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were primarily related to higher interest rates rather than credit quality. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not intend to and was not required to sell investments in an unrealized loss position prior to expected recovery in value.

 Puerto Rico Trusts 
 
 With respect to certain insured securities covered by the 2022 Puerto Rico Resolutions, insured bondholders were permitted to elect to receive custody receipts that represent an interest in the legacy insurance policy plus cash and investments. At least one separate custodial trust was set up for each legacy insured bond, and the trusts are deconsolidated when their liabilities are paid off. For those who made the election above, distributions of Plan Consideration are passed through to insured bondholders under the custody receipts to the extent of any cash or proceeds of new securities held in the custodial trust and are applied to make payments and/or prepayments of amounts due under the legacy insured bonds. The Company s insurance policy continues to guarantee principal and interest coming due on the legacy insured bonds in accordance with the terms of such insurance policy on the originally scheduled legacy bond interest and principal payment dates to the extent that distributions of Plan Consideration are insufficient to pay or prepay such amounts after giving effect to the distributions described in the immediately preceding sentence. In the case of insured bondholders who elected to receive custody receipts, the Company retains the right to satisfy its obligations under the insurance policy with respect to the related legacy insured

 days notice, by paying 100 of the then outstanding principal amount of insured bonds plus accrued interest. 
 
 By December 31, 2023, substantially all of the securities in the Puerto Rico Trusts had been called, and the assets in the Puerto Rico Trusts consisted primarily of cash. In January 2024, such cash proceeds were used to pay down a portion of the liabilities of the Puerto Rico Trusts. The remaining liabilities of the Puerto Rico Trusts will be paid by AG under its financial guaranty policies and are no longer dependent on the credit of PRHTA. For the Puerto Rico Trust liabilities, the Company elected the FVO in order to simplify the accounting for these instruments. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company consolidated custodial trusts established as part of the Puerto Rico resolutions reached in 2022. See Note 3, Outstanding Exposure, Exposure to Puerto Rico. 
 
 Components of FG VIEs Assets and Liabilities 
 
 Net fair value gains and losses on FG VIEs are expected to reverse to by the maturity of the FG VIEs debt, except for net premiums received and net claims paid by the insurance subsidiaries under the financial guaranty insurance contracts. The Company s estimate of expected loss to be paid (recovered) for FG VIEs is included in Note 4, Expected Loss to be Paid (Recovered).

 The inception-to-date change in fair value of the FG VIEs liabilities with recourse (all of which are measured at fair value under the FVO) attributable to the ISCR is calculated by holding all current period assumptions constant for each security and isolating the effect of the change in the Company s CDS spread from the most recent date of consolidation to the current period. In general, if the Company s CDS spread tightens, more value will be assigned to the Company s credit; however, if the Company s CDS spread widens, less value is assigned to the Company s credit.

 CIVs 
 
 CIVs consist of certain Sound Point funds for which the Company is the primary beneficiary or has a controlling interest. The Company consolidates investment vehicles that are VIEs when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary based on its power to direct the most significant activities of each VIE and its level of economic interest in the entities. 
 
 As a result of the Sound Point Transaction and AHP Transaction in third quarter 2023, the Company deconsolidated CIV assets of billion and CIV liabilities of billion. The Company recognized a loss on deconsolidation of million, which was reported in fair value gains (losses) on CIVs for third quarter 2023 and nine months 2023. 
 
 The assets and liabilities of the Company s CIVs are held within separate legal entities. The assets of the CIVs are not available to creditors of the Company, other than creditors of the applicable CIVs. In addition, creditors of the CIVs have no recourse against the assets of the Company, other than the assets of such applicable CIVs. Liquidity available at the Company s CIVs is not available for corporate liquidity needs, except to the extent of the Company s investment in the funds, subject to redemption provisions. Changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities of CIVs, interest income and expense, and gains and losses on consolidation and deconsolidation of CIVs are reported in fair value gains (losses) on CIVs in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company consolidated CIVs. Effective July 1, 2024, one of the CIVs had distributed substantially all of its invested assets to AGAS. Beginning on July 1, 2024, the Company classifies the million of distributed investments as either (i) trading securities, (ii) equity method investments or (iii) equity securities.

 As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the CIVs included derivative contracts with average notional amounts of million. Derivative instruments, which include forward foreign currency contracts, serve as a component of the CIVs investment strategies. The fair value of derivative contracts is reported in the assets of CIVs or other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Noncontrolling Interest in CIVs 
 
 Noncontrolling interest (NCI) represents the portion of the consolidated funds not owned by the Company and includes ownership interests of third parties and former employees. The NCI is non-redeemable and presented on the statement of shareholders equity. 
 
 Other Consolidated VIEs 
 
 In certain instances where the Company consolidates a VIE that was established as part of a loss mitigation negotiated settlement that results in the termination of the obligations under the original financial guaranty insurance or insured credit derivative contract, the Company classifies the assets and liabilities of that VIE in the line items that most accurately reflect the nature of such assets and liabilities, as opposed to within FG VIEs assets and FG VIEs liabilities. The largest of these VIEs had assets of million and liabilities of million as of December 31, 2023, which were reported in investments and credit derivative liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company deconsolidated the largest of these VIEs. 
 
 Non-Consolidated VIEs 
 
 As described in Note 3, Outstanding Exposure, the Company monitors all policies in the insured portfolio. Of the approximately thousand policies monitored as of September 30, 2024, approximately thousand policies are not within the scope of FASB ASC 810, Consolidation because these financial guaranties relate to the debt obligations of governmental organizations or financing entities established by a governmental organization. The majority of the remaining policies involve transactions where the Company is not deemed to currently have control over the FG VIEs most significant activities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company identified and policies, respectively, that contain provisions and experienced events that may trigger consolidation. 
 
 The Company holds variable interests in non-FG VIEs which are not consolidated, as the Company is not the primary beneficiary. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s maximum exposure to losses relating to these VIEs was million, which is limited to the carrying value of these assets.

 There were transfers of securities into Level 3 in the investment portfolio, due to changes in observability of pricing inputs, and in CIVs, in connection with the distribution of assets from the CIV, in third quarter 2024 and nine months 2024. There was a transfer of a fixed-maturity security in the investment portfolio from Level 3 to Level 2 during third quarter 2023 and nine months 2023. There were no other transfers from or into Level 3 during the periods presented.

 securities. All Level 3 securities were priced with the assistance of independent third parties. The pricing is based on a discounted cash flow approach using the third party s proprietary pricing models. The models use inputs such as projected prepayment speeds; severity assumptions; recovery lag assumptions; estimated default rates (determined based on an analysis of collateral attributes, historical collateral performance, borrower profiles and other features relevant to the evaluation of collateral credit quality); home price appreciation/depreciation rates based on macroeconomic forecasts; and recent trading activity. The yield used to discount the projected cash flows is determined by reviewing various attributes of the security including collateral type, weighted average life, sensitivity to losses, vintage, and convexity, in conjunction with market data on comparable securities. Significant changes to any of these inputs could have materially changed the expected timing of cash flows within these securities which could have significantly affected the fair value of the securities. 
 
 Short-Term Investments 
 
 Short-term investments that are traded in active markets are classified as Level 1 as their value is based on quoted market prices. Securities such as discount notes are classified as Level 2 because these securities are typically not actively traded. Due to their approaching maturity the cost of discount notes approximates fair value. 
 
 Other Assets 
 
 Committed Capital Securities 
 
 AG has entered into put agreements with separate custodial trusts allowing it to issue an aggregate of million of non-cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred securities to the trusts in exchange for cash. 
 
 The arrangement entails custodial trusts (Woodbourne Capital Trust I, II, III and IV and Sutton Capital Trust I, II, III and IV), each of which issued million face amount of committed capital securities (CCS) and invested the proceeds of that issuance in eligible assets that would enable the trust to have the cash necessary to respond to AG s exercise of a put option. 
 
 The put option consists of a right that AG has, pursuant to separate put agreements that AG entered into with each of the trusts, to issue to each trust million of non-cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred stock, in exchange for an equivalent amount of cash (i.e., an aggregate of million). When AG exercises its put option, the relevant trust(s) must liquidate the portfolio of high-quality, liquid assets that it currently maintains and use the liquidation proceeds to purchase AG preferred stock. The put agreements have no scheduled termination date or maturity, but may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain specified events. None of the events that would give rise to a termination of the put agreements have occurred. 
 
 The fair value of CCS, which is reported in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, represents the difference between the present value of the remaining expected put option premium payments under the put agreements, and the estimated present value of the amounts that the Company would hypothetically have to pay as of the reporting date for a

 and , based on fair value, of the Company s CDS contracts were fair valued using this minimum premium as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 A credit derivative liability on protection sold is the result of contractual cash inflows on in-force transactions that are lower than what a hypothetical financial guarantor could receive if it sold protection on the same risk as of the reporting date. If the Company were able to freely exchange these contracts (i.e., assuming its contracts did not contain proscriptions on transfer and there was a viable exchange market), it would realize a loss representing the difference between the lower contractual premiums to which it is entitled and the current market premiums for a similar contract. The Company determines the fair value of its CDS contracts by applying the difference between the current premium and the contractual premium for the remaining duration of each contract to the notional value of such contract and then discounting such amounts using the applicable discount rate corresponding to the weighted average remaining life of the contract. The rates used to discount future expected premium cash flows ranged from to as of September 30, 2024 and to as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company s credit derivative valuation model is a consistent approach that takes into account the transaction structure and the key drivers of market value and maximizes the use of market-driven inputs whenever they are available. However, because there is no exit market or any actual exit transactions, the Company s exit market is a hypothetical one based on the Company s entry market and there is a very limited and illiquid market in which to validate the reasonableness of the fair values developed by the Company s model. 
 
 FG VIEs Assets and Liabilities 
 
 FG VIEs include Puerto Rico Trusts and structured finance and other FG VIEs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, assets in the Puerto Rico Trusts, consisted of fixed-maturity debt security classified as Level 3. The Company elected the FVO for the Puerto Rico Trusts liabilities and they are classified as Level 3. Structured finance and other FG VIEs assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under the FVO and are classified as Level 3. 
 
 The fair value of the residential mortgage loan FG VIEs assets is generally sensitive to changes in estimated prepayment speeds; estimated default rates (determined on the basis of an analysis of collateral attributes such as: historical collateral performance, borrower profiles and other features relevant to the evaluation of collateral credit quality); yields implied by market prices for similar securities; and, as applicable, house price depreciation/appreciation rates based on macroeconomic forecasts. Significant changes to some of these inputs could have materially changed the fair value of the FG VIEs assets and the implied collateral losses within these transactions. In general, the fair value of the FG VIEs assets is most sensitive to changes in the projected collateral losses, where an increase in collateral losses typically leads to a potential decrease in the fair value of FG VIEs assets, while a decrease in collateral losses typically leads to an increase in the fair value of FG VIEs assets.

 On December 27, 2023 the Bermuda government enacted a corporate income tax at the rate of which will apply to the Bermuda Subsidiaries for accounting periods starting on or after January 1, 2025. The enactment of the corporate income tax regime required the Company to recognize Bermuda deferred taxes for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2023. An economic transition adjustment (ETA) equal to the difference between the fair market value and the carrying value of assets and liabilities of each of the Company s Bermuda insurance subsidiaries as of September 30, 2023 resulted in the establishment of a deferred tax asset and corresponding benefit of million reported in the fourth quarter of 2023 consolidated statement of operations. The ETA is expected to be utilized over to years, beginning in 2025. 
 
 AGL s U.S., U.K. and French subsidiaries are subject to income taxes imposed by U.S., U.K. and French authorities, respectively, and file applicable tax returns. In addition, AGRO, a Bermuda domiciled company, has elected under Internal Revenue Code Section 953(d) to be taxed as a U.S. domestic corporation. 
 
 AGUS files a consolidated federal income tax return with all of its U.S. subsidiaries. Assured Guaranty Overseas US Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries, AGRO and AG Intermediary Inc., file their own consolidated federal income tax return.

 Net current tax assets (liabilities) ) ) 
 
 Valuation Allowance 
 
 The Company came to the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully realized after weighing all positive and negative evidence available as required under GAAP. The positive evidence that was considered included the cumulative income the Company has earned over the last and the significant unearned premium income to be included in taxable income. The positive evidence outweighs any negative evidence that exists. As such, the Company believes that no valuation allowance is necessary in connection with the remaining deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to analyze the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. 
 
 Changes in market conditions during 2024 and 2023, including rising interest rates, resulted in the recording of deferred tax assets related to net unrealized tax capital losses. When assessing recoverability of these deferred tax assets, the Company considers the ability and intent to hold the underlying securities to recovery in value, if necessary, as well as other factors as noted above. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, based on all available evidence, including capital loss carryback capacity, the Company concluded that the deferred tax assets related to the unrealized tax capital losses on the available-for-sale securities portfolios are, more likely than not, expected to be realized. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The Company s provision for income taxes for interim financial periods is not based on an estimated annual effective rate due, for example, to the variability in loss reserves, fair value of its credit derivatives and VIEs and foreign exchange gains and losses which prevents the Company from projecting a reliable estimated annual effective tax rate and pre-tax income for the full year 2024. A discrete calculation of the provision is calculated for each interim period. 
 
 The Company s overall effective tax rate fluctuates based on the distribution of income across jurisdictions. The effective tax rates reflect the proportion of income recognized by each of the Company s operating subsidiaries, with 
 
 U.S. subsidiaries taxed at the U.S. marginal corporate income tax rate of ,

 The expected tax provision (benefit) is calculated as the sum of pre-tax income in each jurisdiction multiplied by the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction by which it will be taxed. Where there is a pre-tax loss in one jurisdiction and pre-tax income in another, the total combined expected tax rate may be higher or lower than any of the individual statutory rates.

 Litigation 
 
 On November 28, 2011, Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (in administration) (LBIE) sued AG Financial Products Inc. (AGFP), an affiliate of AG, which, in the past, had provided credit protection to counterparties under CDS. AG acts as the credit support provider of AGFP under these CDS. LBIE s complaint, which was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (the Court), asserted a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on AGFP's termination in December 2008 of credit derivative transactions between LBIE and AGFP and asserted claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on AGFP s termination in July 2009 of other credit derivative transactions between LBIE and AGFP and AGFP s calculation of the termination payment in connection with those other credit derivative transactions. Following defaults by LBIE, AGFP had terminated the transactions in question in compliance with the agreement between AGFP and LBIE, and properly calculated that LBIE owes AGFP approximately million for the claims which were dismissed (as described below) and approximately million in connection with the termination of the other credit derivative transactions, whereas LBIE asserted in the complaint that AGFP owes LBIE a termination payment of approximately billion. On March 15, 2013, the Court granted AGFP s motion to dismiss in respect of the count relating to the credit derivative transactions and narrowed LBIE s claim with respect to the other credit derivative transactions. Following a bench trial, on March 8, 2023, the Court rendered its decision and found in favor of AGFP. On June 30, 2023, the clerk entered judgment in favor of AGFP in the amount of approximately million plus post-judgment simple interest at an annual rate of . On July 1, 2023, AGFP moved the Court to award it approximately million for attorneys fees and expenses AGFP incurred through March 2023. The parties reached a confidential settlement with respect to this motion for attorneys fees, and AGFP withdrew the motion without prejudice on October 30, 2023. On September 22, 2023, LBIE appealed the Court s post-trial decision to the New York Appellate Division s First Judicial Department (Appellate Division). On March 14, 2024, the Appellate Division affirmed the Court s judgment. On April 15,

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward Looking Statements 
 
 This Form 10-Q contains information that includes or is based upon forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements give the expectations or forecasts of future events of Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGL) and its subsidiaries (collectively with AGL, Assured Guaranty or the Company). These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and relate to future operating or financial performance. 
 
 Any or all of Assured Guaranty s forward looking statements herein are based on current expectations and the current economic environment and may turn out to be incorrect. Assured Guaranty s actual results may vary materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. Among factors that could cause actual results to differ adversely are: 
 
 (i) significant changes in inflation, interest rates, the world s credit markets or segments thereof, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or general economic conditions, including the possibility of a recession or stagflation; (ii) geopolitical risk, terrorism and political violence risk, including those arising out of Russia s invasion of Ukraine and intentional or accidental escalation between The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Russia, conflict in the Middle East and confrontation over Iran s nuclear program, the polarized political environment in the United States (U.S.), and U.S. China strategic competition; (iii) cybersecurity risk and the impacts of artificial intelligence, machine learning and other technological advances, including potentially increasing the risks of malicious cyber attacks, dissemination of misinformation, and disruption of markets; (iv) the possibility of a U.S. government shutdown, payment defaults on the debt of the U.S. government or instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, and downgrades to their credit ratings; (v) developments in the world s financial and capital markets, including stresses in the financial condition of banking institutions in the U.S. and the possibility that increasing participation of unregulated financial institutions in these markets results in losses or lower valuations of assets, reduced liquidity and credit and/or contraction of these markets, that adversely affect repayment rates of insured obligors, Assured Guaranty s insurance loss or recovery experience, or investments of Assured Guaranty; (vi) reduction in the amount of available insurance opportunities and/or in the demand for Assured Guaranty s insurance; (vii) the possibility that budget or pension shortfalls, difficulties in obtaining additional financing or other factors will result in credit losses or liquidity claims on obligations of state, territorial and local governments, their related authorities, public corporations and other obligors that Assured Guaranty insures or reinsures; (viii) insured losses, including losses with respect to related legal proceedings, in excess of those expected by Assured Guaranty or the failure of Assured Guaranty to realize loss recoveries that are assumed in its expected loss estimates for insurance exposures, including as a result of the final resolution of Assured Guaranty s Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) exposure or the amounts recovered on securities received in connection with the resolution of Puerto Rico exposures already resolved; (ix) the impact of Assured Guaranty satisfying its obligations under insurance policies with respect to legacy insured Puerto Rico bonds; (x) the possibility that underwriting insurance in new jurisdictions and/or covering new sectors or classes of business does not result in the benefits anticipated or subjects Assured Guaranty to negative consequences; (xi) increased competition, including from new entrants into the financial guaranty industry, nonpayment insurance and other forms of capital saving or risk syndication available to banks and insurers; (xii) the possibility that investments made by Assured Guaranty for its investment portfolio, including alternative investments, do not result in the benefits anticipated or subject Assured Guaranty to reduced liquidity at a time it requires liquidity, or to other negative or unanticipated consequences; (xiii) the impacts of Assured Guaranty s transactions with Sound Point Capital Management, LP (Sound Point, LP) and certain of its investment management affiliates (together with Sound Point, LP, Sound Point) and/or Assured Healthcare Partners LLC (AHP) on Assured Guaranty and its relationships with its shareholders, regulators, rating agencies, employees and the obligors it insures and on the asset management business contributed to Sound Point, LP and on the business of AHP and their relationships with their respective clients and employees; (xiv) the possibility that strategic transactions made by Assured Guaranty, including the transactions with Sound Point and/or AHP and/or merger of Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. (AGM) with and into Assured Guaranty Inc. (AG, formerly Assured Guaranty Corp.), do not result in the benefits anticipated or subject Assured Guaranty to negative consequences; (xv) the inability to control the business, management or policies of entities in which Assured Guaranty holds a minority interest; (xvi) the impact of market volatility on the fair value of Assured Guaranty s assets and liabilities subject to mark-to-market, including certain of its investments, contracts accounted for as derivatives, its committed capital securities, its consolidated investment vehicles and certain consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs); (xvii) rating agency action, including a ratings downgrade, a change in outlook, the placement of ratings on watch for downgrade, or a change in rating criteria, at any time, of AGL or any of its insurance subsidiaries, and/or of any securities AGL or any of its subsidiaries have issued, and/or of transactions that AGL s insurance subsidiaries have insured; (xviii) the inability of Assured Guaranty to access external sources of capital on acceptable terms; (xix) changes in applicable accounting policies or practices; (xx) changes in applicable laws or 
 73

regulations, including insurance, bankruptcy and tax laws, or other governmental actions; (xxi) the possibility that legal or regulatory decisions or determinations subject obligations that Assured Guaranty insures or reinsures to negative consequences; (xxii) difficulties with the execution of Assured Guaranty s business strategy; (xxiii) loss of key personnel; (xxiv) the effects of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures; (xxv) public health crises, including pandemics and endemics, and the governmental and private actions taken in response to such events; (xxvi) natural or man-made catastrophes; (xxvii) the impact of climate change on Assured Guaranty s business and regulatory actions taken related to such risk; (xxviii) other risk factors identified in AGL s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); (xxix) other risks and uncertainties that have not been identified at this time; and (xxx) management s response to these factors. 
 
 The foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive, and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this Form 10-Q, as well as the risk factors included in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Investors are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the Company makes on related subjects in the Company s reports filed with the SEC. 
 
 If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the Company s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially from what the Company projected. Any forward looking statements in this Form 10-Q reflect the Company s current views with respect to future events and are subject to these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to its operations, results of operations, growth strategy and liquidity.

Overview 

Business 
 
 The Company reports its results of operations in two distinct segments, Insurance and Asset Management, consistent with the manner in which the Company s chief operating decision maker reviews the business to assess performance and allocate resources. The Company s Corporate division and other activities (including financial guaranty VIEs (FG VIEs) and consolidated investment vehicles (CIVs)) are presented separately.

Table of Contents 

In the Insurance segment, the Company provides credit protection products to the U.S. and non-U.S. public finance (including infrastructure) and structured finance markets. Until July 1, 2023, the Company served as investment advisor to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and opportunity funds, through Assured Investment Management LLC (AssuredIM LLC) and its investment management affiliates (together with AssuredIM LLC, AssuredIM). Beginning July 1, 2023, the Company participates in the asset management business through its ownership interest in Sound Point. See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 1, Business and Basis of Presentation. 
 
 The Corporate division primarily consists of: (i) interest expense and any losses on the extinguishment of the debt of Assured Guaranty US Holdings Inc. (AGUS) and Assured Guaranty Municipal Holdings Inc. (AGMH) (the U.S. Holding Companies); (ii) other corporate operating expenses of AGL and the U.S. Holding Companies, and (iii) beginning in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 (third quarter 2024), equity in earnings from certain alternative investments that were transferred from AG to AGMH as part of the share redemption that occurred on August 5, 2024 in connection with the merger of AGM with and into AG, as discussed below. The Other category in the segment tables below primarily includes the effect of consolidating FG VIEs and CIVs (FG VIE and CIV consolidation), intersegment eliminations and, prior to July 1, 2023, the reclassification of reimbursable fund expenses. See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 2, Segment Information. 

Economic Environment 
 
 Real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 2.8 in the third quarter 2024, compared to an increase of 3.0 in the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 (second quarter 2024), according to the third quarter 2024 advance estimate news release issued by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. At the end of September 2024, the U.S. unemployment rate, seasonally adjusted, stood at 4.1 , the same as where it stood at the end of second quarter 2024. The Company believes a more robust economy makes it less likely that obligors whose obligations it guarantees will default. 
 
 According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the inflation rate in the U.S. before seasonal adjustment for the 12-month period ending September 2024, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, was 2.4 , as compared to 3.0 for the 12-month period ending June 2024. According to the United Kingdom s (U.K.) Office for National Statistics, the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers housing costs rose 2.6 for the 12 months through September 2024, down from 2.8 for the 12 months ended June 2024. The Company believes that higher inflation may put pressure on the budgets of obligors whose obligations it guarantees and make defaults more likely. In addition, consumer price inflation in the U.K. increases reported net par outstanding for certain U.K. exposures with approximately 24.0 billion of net par outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and also increases projected future installment premiums on the portion of such exposure that pays at least a portion of the premium on an installment basis over the term of the exposure. 
 
 At its September 17-18, 2024 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to lower the federal funds rate by 0.50 to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 , which was a reversal of the rate increases it had initiated in March 2022 to combat inflation. The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks lend to and borrow from each other, is the benchmark for most interest rates, and tends to influence mortgage rates. As the federal funds rate decreases, interest rates, including mortgage rates, tend to follow. At its November 6-7, 2024 meeting, the FOMC further lowered the federal funds rate by 0.25 to a range of 4.50 to 4.75 , stating that it seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 over the longer run, and that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC has indicated it will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. These assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. 
 
 The level and direction of interest rates and credit spreads impact the Company in numerous ways. On the one hand, lower interest rates may increase the fair value of fixed-maturity securities currently held in the Company s investment portfolio, encourage municipal bond issuance and positively impact the finances of some of the obligors whose payments the Company insures. On the other hand, lower interest rates may decrease the base on which the Company charges up-front premium on most new U.S. municipal bond transactions and may also decrease amounts the Company can earn on fixed-maturity securities newly acquired for its investment portfolio. Lower interest rates also are often accompanied by narrower spreads, which may also decrease the level of premiums the Company can charge for those products. 
 
 The 30-year AAA Municipal Market Data (MMD) rate is a measure of interest rates in the Company s largest financial guaranty insurance market, U.S. public finance. The MMD rate averaged 3.60 for third quarter 2024, lower than the 3.82 average for second quarter 2024, and lower than the 3.77 average for the quarter ended September 2023. Meanwhile, the difference, or credit spread, between the 30-year BBB-rated general obligation relative to the 30-year AAA MMD averaged 90 basis points (bps) in third quarter 2024, which is flat compared to the 90 bps average for second quarter 2024, and narrower 
 75 

Table of Contents 

than the 101 bps average for the quarter ended September 2023. The Company believes that wider spreads could permit it to increase its premium rates on new business. 
 
 According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.08 as of September 26, 2024, down from 7.31 one year ago. The Company believes that, despite recent decreases in mortgage interest rates, restricted housing inventory continues to influence home prices where demand outpaces supply. Higher housing prices may benefit distressed residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) the Company insures. The National Association of Realtors reported that year-over-year existing-home sales decreased 3.5 from September 2023 to September 2024, while the median existing-home sales price increased 3.0 from September 2023 392,700) to September 2024 404,500). 

Key Business Strategies 
 
 The Company continually evaluates its business strategies and is currently pursuing key business strategies in three areas: (i) insurance; (ii) asset management and alternative investments; and (iii) capital management. 
 
 Insurance 
 
 The Company seeks to grow the insurance business through new business production, acquisitions of legacy financial guarantors or reinsurance or novation of their insured portfolios, and to continue to mitigate losses in its current insured portfolio. 
 
 Growth of the Insured Portfolio 
 
 The Company seeks to grow its financial guaranty insurance portfolio through new business production in each of its markets: public finance (including infrastructure) and structured finance. The Company believes high-profile defaults by municipal obligors, such as Puerto Rico, Detroit, Michigan and Stockton, California as well as events such as the COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased awareness of the value of bond insurance and stimulated demand for the product. The Company believes there will be continued demand for its insurance in this market because, for those exposures that the Company guarantees, it undertakes the tasks of credit selection, analysis, negotiation of terms, surveillance and, if necessary, loss mitigation. The Company believes that its insurance: (i) encourages retail investors, who typically have fewer resources than the Company for analyzing municipal bonds, to purchase such bonds; (ii) enables institutional investors to operate more efficiently; and (iii) allows smaller, less well-known issuers to gain market access on a more cost-effective basis. 
 
 The low interest rate environment and tight U.S. municipal credit spreads from when the financial crisis began in 2008 through early 2020 dampened demand for bond insurance compared with the levels before the financial crisis. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, credit spreads initially widened as a result of market concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on some municipal credits, thereby improving demand for financial guaranty insurance even in a low interest rate environment, before narrowing again in 2022. The Company believes that, over time, wider credit spreads may improve demand for bond insurance. 
 
 In certain segments of the infrastructure and structured finance markets, the Company believes its financial guaranty product is competitive with other financing options. For example, certain investors may receive advantageous capital requirement treatment with the addition of the Company s guaranty. The Company considers its involvement in both infrastructure and structured finance transactions to be beneficial because such transactions diversify both the Company s business opportunities and its risk profile beyond U.S. public finance. The timing of new business production in the infrastructure and structured finance sectors is influenced by typically long lead times and therefore may vary from period to period.

 ____________________ 
 (1) Source: The amounts in the table are those reported by Thomson Reuters. The table excludes Corporate-CUSIP transactions insured by Assured Guaranty, certain of which the Company also considers to be public finance business. 
 
 The Company also considers opportunities to acquire financial guaranty portfolios, whether by acquiring financial guarantors that are no longer actively writing new business or their insured portfolios, generally through reinsurance or novations. These transactions enable the Company to improve its future earnings and deploy excess capital. 
 
 Merger of the U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries 
 
 On August 1, 2024, AGM merged with and into AG, with AG as the surviving company. Upon the merger all liabilities of AGM, including insurance policies issued or assumed by AGM, became obligations of AG. 
 
 The Company believes that Assured Guaranty s simplified organizational and capital structure following the merger will help it grow its business. The combined company, as compared with either AG or AGM before the merger, has a larger, more highly diversified insured portfolio, a larger investment portfolio and a larger capital base, creating a more efficient capital structure and greater claims-paying resources. In addition, the combined company, as compared with either AG or AGM before the merger, has larger regulatory single risk limits. Such limits are applicable to each individual financial guaranty insurer for obligations issued by a single entity and backed by a single revenue source. Since the combined company has greater policyholder s surplus and contingency reserves, as compared to standalone AG or AGM before the merger, the dollar amounts for its single risk limits on obligations issued by a single entity and backed by a single revenue source are also greater. 
 
 Prior to the merger, AG had been directly owned by AGUS. As a result of the merger, effective as of August 1, 2024, AG is directly owned by AGMH, a subsidiary of AGUS. 
 
 Loss Mitigation 
 
 In an effort to avoid, reduce or recover losses and potential losses in its insurance portfolio, the Company employs a number of strategies. 
 
 In the public finance area, the Company believes its experience and the resources it is prepared to deploy, as well as its ability to provide bond insurance or other contributions as part of a solution, result in more favorable outcomes in distressed public finance situations than would be the case without its participation. This has been illustrated by the Company s role in negotiating various agreements in connection with the restructuring of obligations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and various obligations of its related authorities and public corporations, as well as Detroit, Michigan and Stockton, California. The Company will also, where appropriate, pursue litigation to enforce its rights. For example, the Company initiated a number of 
 77 

Table of Contents 

legal actions to enforce its rights with respect to obligations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and various obligations of its related authorities and public corporations. 
 
 In 2022, as a result of the resolution of the Company s exposure to insured Puerto Rico credits experiencing payment default other than PREPA (2022 Puerto Rico Resolutions), the Company received cash, new general obligation bonds (New GO Bonds), new bonds backed by toll revenues (Toll Bonds, and together with New GO Bonds, New Recovery Bonds) and contingent value instruments (CVIs). The CVIs are intended to provide creditors with additional recoveries tied to the outperformance of the Puerto Rico 5.5 Sales and Use Tax receipts against May 2020 certified fiscal plan projections, subject to annual and lifetime caps. The Company may sell in the future any CVIs it continues to hold. The Company continues to work to resolve its remaining unresolved defaulted Puerto Rico exposure, PREPA. For more information about developments in Puerto Rico and related recovery litigation being pursued by the Company, see Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 3, Outstanding Exposure, and the Insured Portfolio section below. 
 
 The Company is, and for several years has been, working with the servicers of some of the U.S. RMBS transactions it insures to encourage the servicers to provide alternatives to distressed borrowers that will encourage them to continue making payments on their loans to help improve the performance of the related RMBS. For public finance credits, the Company s surveillance function monitors and proactively engages with the distressed credits to offer assistance aimed to improve operations and financial performance, including access to external consultants and other industry experts. 
 
 The Company may also purchase attractively priced obligations, including below-investment-grade (BIG) obligations, that it has insured and for which it had expected losses to be paid, in order to mitigate the economic effect of insured losses (Loss Mitigation Securities). The fair value of Loss Mitigation Securities as of September 30, 2024 (excluding the value of the Company s insurance) was 468 million. 
 
 In some instances, the terms of the Company s policy or the terms of certain workout orders and resolutions give it the option to pay principal on an accelerated basis on an obligation on which it has paid a claim, thereby reducing the amount of guaranteed interest due in the future. The Company has at times exercised this option, which uses cash but reduces projected future losses. The Company may also facilitate the issuance of refunding bonds, by either providing insurance on the refunding bonds or purchasing refunding bonds, or both. Refunding bonds may provide the issuer with payment relief. 
 
 Asset Management and Alternative Investments 
 
 Until July 1, 2023, the Company pursued its asset management strategy through AssuredIM. Upon the closing of the transaction with Sound Point (Sound Point Transaction) and the transaction with AHP (AHP Transaction), effective as of July 1, 2023, the Company participates in the asset management business through its ownership interest in Sound Point, and no longer directly manages investments for third parties. The Company s ownership interest in Sound Point furthers its strategy of participating in a fee-based earnings stream independent of the risk-based premiums generated by its financial guaranty business. The Sound Point business was strengthened by the addition of AssuredIM s assets under management (AUM) (excluding AUM relating to AHP). See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 1, Business and Basis of Presentation, for a description of the Sound Point Transaction and the AHP Transaction. 
 
 The Company expects its relationship with Sound Point to also enhance its alternative investment opportunities. The Company has agreed to invest an aggregate amount of 1.5 billion in alternative investments, including 1 billion in Sound Point managed investments. 
 
 Capital Management 
 
 The Company has developed strategies to efficiently manage capital within the Assured Guaranty group. 
 
 From 2013 through November 8, 2024, the Company has repurchased 150 million common shares for approximately 5.3 billion, representing approximately 77 of the total shares outstanding at the beginning of the repurchase program in 2013. On May 2, 2024 and November 8, 2024, the AGL Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the repurchase of an additional 300 million and 250 million, respectively, of the Company s common shares. Under this and previous authorizations, as of November 8, 2024, the remaining amount the Company was authorized to purchase was approximately 385 million of its common shares. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, form and amount of the share repurchases under the program are at the discretion of management and will depend on a variety of factors, including funds available at the parent company, other potential uses for such funds, market conditions, the Company s capital position, legal requirements and other factors. The repurchase program may be modified,

extended or terminated by the Board at any time and it does not have an expiration date. See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 12, Shareholders Equity, for additional information about the Company s repurchases of its common shares.

 As of September 30, 2024, the estimated accretive effect of the cumulative repurchases of common shares since the beginning of 2013 was approximately: 56.63 per share in shareholders equity attributable to AGL, 58.75 per share in adjusted operating shareholders equity and 97.75 per share in adjusted book value. 
 
 In May 2024, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approved, and AGM implemented, the redemption of approximately 100 million of AGM s shares of common stock from AGMH. 
 
 In connection with the merger of AGM into AG, the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) approved, and in third quarter 2024 AG implemented, the redemption of approximately 300 million of AG s shares of common stock from AGMH in exchange for cash of 167 million and the remainder in alternative investments. 
 
 The Company considers the appropriate mix of debt and equity in its capital structure. In 2023, the Company issued 350 million in 6.125 Senior Notes due in 2028 and used the proceeds primarily to redeem 330 million of 5 Senior Notes due in 2024. Since the second quarter of 2017, AGUS has also purchased 154 million in principal of AGMH s outstanding Junior Subordinated Debentures. 
 
 The Company may choose to redeem or make additional purchases of this or other Company debt in the future. See Liquidity and Capital Resources AGL and its U.S. Holding Companies.

 Third Quarter 2024 Compared with Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Net income attributable to AGL for third quarter 2024 was higher compared with the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 (third quarter 2023) primarily due to: 
 
 a benefit in net loss and LAE in third quarter 2024 of 51 million, compared with loss and LAE of 100 million in third quarter 2023, and 
 foreign exchange gains on remeasurement of 55 million in third quarter 2024, compared with foreign exchange losses of 39 million in third quarter 2023. 
 
 81 

Table of Contents 

These increases were offset in part by: 
 
 the gain associated with the Sound Point Transaction and AHP Transaction, net of transaction expenses, of 241 million (pre-tax) in third quarter 2023. 
 
 Nine Months 2024 Compared with Nine Months 2023 
 
 Net income attributable to AGL for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 (nine months 2024) was lower compared with the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 (nine months 2023) primarily due to: 
 
 the gain associated with the Sound Point Transaction and AHP Transaction, net of transaction expenses, of 215 million (pre-tax) in nine months 2023, 
 lower fair value gains on credit derivatives, 
 lower net investment income primarily due to lower income on Loss Mitigation Securities, which were partially offset by higher short-term income, and 
 lower other income mainly due to the reversal of a previously recorded litigation accrual of 20 million in nine months 2023. 
 
 These decreases were offset in part by: 
 
 a benefit in net loss and LAE in nine months 2024 of 54 million, compared with loss and LAE of 159 in nine months 2023, 
 higher net earned premiums in nine months 2024 compared with nine months 2023 primarily due to one large refunded transaction, and 
 higher foreign exchange gains on remeasurement of 43 million in nine months 2024, compared with 9 million in nine months 2023. 
 
 The Company s effective tax rate reflects the proportion of income recognized by each of the Company s operating subsidiaries, with U.S. subsidiaries generally taxed at the U.S. marginal corporate income tax rate of 21 , U.K. subsidiaries taxed at the U.K. marginal corporate tax rate of 19 prior to March 31, 2023 and 25 after April 1, 2023, the French subsidiary taxed at the French marginal corporate tax rate of 25 , and Assured Guaranty Re Ltd. (AG Re) and Cedar Personnel Ltd. taxed at the Bermuda marginal corporate tax rate of 0 . Effective January 1, 2024, the U.K. adopted a global minimum tax rate of 15 under the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Pillar Two rules. See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 10, Income Taxes. 
 
 Adjusted Operating Income 
 
 Adjusted operating income in third quarter 2024 was 130 million compared with 206 million in third quarter 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the gain associated with the Sound Point Transaction and AHP Transaction in third quarter 2023, offset in part by a benefit in loss expense in third quarter 2024 compared with loss expense in third quarter 2023. 
 
 Adjusted operating income in nine months 2024 was 323 million, compared with 310 million in nine months 2023. The increase was primarily due to a benefit in loss expense in nine months 2024, compared with a loss expense in nine months 2023, offset in part by a gain from the Sound Point Transaction and AHP Transaction in nine months 2023. See Results of Operations Reconciliation to GAAP for the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to AGL to adjusted operating income (loss). 
 
 Book Value and Adjusted Book Value 
 
 Shareholders equity attributable to AGL as of September 30, 2024 increased compared with December 31, 2023, primarily due to net income of 358 million and other comprehensive income of 128 million, offset in part by share repurchases of 412 million and dividends of 52 million. Adjusted operating shareholders equity and adjusted book value decreased primarily due to share repurchases and dividends, partially offset by operating income of 323 million and, in the case of adjusted book value, GWP of 254 million. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for the reconciliation of shareholders equity attributable to AGL to adjusted operating shareholders' equity and adjusted book value. 
 
 On a per share basis, shareholders equity attributable to AGL, adjusted operating shareholders equity and adjusted book value increased as of September 30, 2024 compared with December 31, 2023, due, in part, to the accretive effect of the

 By some key measures, consumer price inflation in the U.S. and the U.K. was higher in recent years than it has been in decades, and interest rates generally increased. Consumer price inflation in the U.K. can impact the Company directly by increasing exposure for certain index-linked U.K. debt with par that accretes with increasing inflation, and also by increasing projected future installment premiums on the portion of such exposure that pays at least some of the premium on an installment basis over the term of the exposure. Consumer price inflation may also impact the Company indirectly to the extent it makes it more difficult for obligors to make their debt payments, and may be accompanied by higher interest rates. 
 
 Higher interest rates impact the Company in numerous other ways. For example, higher interest rates are often accompanied by wider credit spreads, which may make the Company s credit enhancement products more attractive in the market and increase the level of premiums it can charge for that product. Despite the increases in interest rates from 2022 to 2024, the pace of credit spread widening was more modest and market penetration of municipal bond insurance in the U.S. public finance market remained relatively flat compared with 2021 when interest rates were lower. Over time, higher interest rates also increase the amount the Company can earn on its largely fixed-maturity investment portfolio. However, higher interest rates may, in turn, reduce the fair value of the Company s largely fixed-rate fixed-maturity investment portfolio, dampen municipal bond issuance, and negatively impact the finances of some insured obligors.

 Russia s Invasion of Ukraine 
 
 Russia s invasion of Ukraine has led to the imposition of economic sanctions by many western countries against Russia and certain Russian individuals, dislocation in global energy markets, massive refugee movements, and payment default by certain Russian credits. The economic sanctions imposed by western governments, along with decisions by private companies regarding their presence in Russia, continue to reduce western economic ties to Russia and to reshape global economic and political ties more generally, and the Company cannot predict all of the potential effects of the conflict on the world or on the Company. 
 
 The Company s surveillance and treasury functions have reviewed the Company s insurance and investment portfolios, respectively, and have identified no material direct exposure to Ukraine or Russia. In fact, the Company s direct insurance exposure to eastern Europe generally is limited to approximately 234 million in net par outstanding as of September 30, 2024, comprising 216 million net par exposure to the sovereign debt of Poland and 18 million net par exposure to a toll road in Hungary. The Company rates all such exposure investment grade. 
 
 Middle East Conflict 
 
 In light of recent events in the Middle East, the Company s surveillance and treasury functions have reviewed the Company s insurance and investment portfolios, respectively, for exposures to the Middle East. After review, the Company s surveillance and treasury functions have identified no material direct exposure to such area. The Company s direct insurance exposure to the Middle East is generally limited to approximately 68 million in net par outstanding as of September 30, 2024, comprised of funded commitments to subscription finance facilities; however, such exposure may increase to a total of approximately 105 million to the extent all unfunded commitments under the facilities are ultimately funded. The Company rates all such insurance exposure investment grade.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment and require the Company to make estimates and assumptions, based on available information, that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Estimates are inherently subject to change and actual results could differ from those estimates, and the differences may be material to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 83 

Table of Contents 

Critical estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated based on historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that is reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will conform to estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially different in the future due to changes in these estimates and assumptions. 
 
 Listed below are the accounting policies and estimates that the Company believes are most dependent on the application of judgment and assumptions. 
 
 Expected loss to be paid (recovered); 
 Fair value of certain assets and liabilities, primarily: 
 Investments (primarily Loss Mitigation Securities and alternative investments) 
 Assets and liabilities of CIVs 
 Assets and liabilities of FG VIEs

Net Earned Premiums and Credit Derivative Revenues 
 
 Premiums are earned over the contractual lives, or in the case of insured obligations backed by homogeneous pools of assets, the remaining expected lives, of financial guaranty insurance contracts. The Company periodically estimates remaining expected lives of its insured obligations backed by homogeneous pools of assets and makes prospective adjustments for such changes in expected lives. Scheduled net earned premiums decrease each year unless replaced by a higher amount of new business or books of business acquired in business combinations. See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 5, Contracts Accounted for as Insurance, Premiums, for additional information. 
 
 Net earned premiums due to accelerations are attributable to changes in the expected lives of insured obligations driven by: (i) refundings of insured obligations; or (ii) terminations of insured obligations either through negotiated agreements or the exercise of the Company s contractual rights to make claim payments on an accelerated basis. 
 
 Refundings occur in the public finance market when municipalities and other public finance issuers pay down insured obligations prior to their originally scheduled maturities. Refundings tend to increase when issuers can refinance their debt obligations at lower rates than they are currently paying. The premiums associated with the insured obligations of municipalities and other public finance issuers are generally received upfront when the obligations are issued and insured. When issuers pay down insured obligations, the Company is no longer on risk for payment defaults and therefore accelerates the recognition of the remaining nonrefundable deferred premium revenue. The amortization of the Company s outstanding book of business along with the previously high levels of refunding activity and the higher interest rate environment has led to a lower volume of refunding opportunities over the last several years. 
 
 Terminations are generally negotiated agreements with beneficiaries resulting in the extinguishment of the Company s insurance obligation. Terminations have been more common in the structured finance asset class but may also occur in the public finance asset class. While each termination may have different terms, they all result in the expiration of the Company s insurance risk, the acceleration of the recognition of the associated deferred premium revenue and the reduction of any remaining premiums receivable.

 Third Quarter 2024 
 
 U.S. public finance GWP and PVP in third quarter 2024 were higher than the comparable GWP and PVP in third quarter 2023, primarily due to an increase in insured par and higher premium rates in primary market transactions. The Company s direct par written represented 60 of the total U.S. municipal market insured issuance in third quarter 2024, compared with 61 in third quarter 2023, and the Company s penetration of all municipal issuance was 4.2 in third quarter 2024 compared with 4.6 in third quarter 2023. 
 
 In third quarter 2024, non-U.S. public finance GWP and PVP were higher than GWP and PVP in third quarter 2023 primarily due to guaranties of several U.K. regulated utility and airport transactions in third quarter 2024. 
 
 Global structured finance GWP and PVP in third quarter 2024 were higher than the comparable GWP and PVP in third quarter 2023. In third quarter 2024, the Company insured a transaction in Australia that provided protection on an approximately 600 million core lending portfolio for an Australian bank. 
 
 Nine Months 2024 
 
 U.S. public finance GWP and PVP in nine months 2024 were higher than GWP and PVP in nine months 2023, primarily due to several large transportation revenue transactions. The Company s direct par written represented 57 of the total U.S. municipal market insured issuance in nine months 2024, compared with 62 in nine months 2023, and the Company s penetration of all municipal issuance was 4.4 in nine months 2024 compared with 5.3 in nine months 2023.

Table of Contents 

In nine months 2024, non-U.S. public finance GWP was lower than GWP in nine-months 2023, while non-U.S. public finance PVP in nine months 2024 was higher than PVP in nine months 2023. GWP declined mainly due to adjustments to the consumer price index that affects the present value of future premiums on the existing book of consumer price index linked insured obligations. New business in nine months 2024 primarily included secondary market guaranties of several U.K. regulated utility and airport transactions, as well as the annual renewal of certain liquidity guarantees. 
 
 In nine months 2024, structured finance GWP and PVP were 38 million and 44 million, respectively, compared with GWP and PVP of 52 million and 82 million, respectively, in nine months 2023. Structured finance GWP and PVP in nine months 2024 were primarily attributable to insurance securitization, bank balance sheet relief and subscription finance transactions. 
 
 Business activity in the non-U.S. public finance and structured finance sectors typically has long lead times and therefore may vary from period to period. 
 
 Financial Strength Ratings 
 
 Demand for the financial guaranties issued by the Company s insurance subsidiaries may be impacted by changes in the credit ratings assigned to them by the rating agencies. The financial strength ratings (or similar ratings) assigned to AGL s insurance subsidiaries, along with the date of the most recent rating action (or confirmation) by the rating agency assigning the rating, are shown in the table below. 
 
 S P Global Ratings, a division of Standard Poor s Financial Services LLC (S P) Kroll Bond Rating Agency Moody s Ratings (Moody s) A.M. Best Company, Inc.

 Ratings are subject to continuous rating agency review and revision or withdrawal at any time. In addition, the Company periodically assesses the value of each rating assigned to each of its companies, and as a result of such assessment may request that a rating agency add or drop a rating from certain of its companies. There can be no assurance that any of the rating agencies will not take negative action on the financial strength ratings (or similar ratings) of AGL s insurance subsidiaries in the future or cease to rate one or more of AGL s insurance subsidiaries, either voluntarily or at the request of that subsidiary. 
 
 Income from Investments 
 
 Net investment income is a function of the yield that the Company earns on available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities and short-term investments and the size of such portfolio. The investment yield on fixed-maturity securities is a function of market interest rates at the time of investment as well as the type, credit quality and maturity of the securities in this portfolio. 
 
 CVIs issued by Puerto Rico and received as part of the 2022 Puerto Rico Resolutions are classified as trading with changes in fair value reported in fair value gains (losses) on trading securities in the condensed consolidated statements on operations. The fair value of remaining CVIs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 136 million and 318 million, respectively. 
 
 Equity method investments in the Insurance segment include investments that AG Asset Strategies LLC (AGAS) makes in certain alternative investments, primarily Sound Point and AHP funds. The income (loss) on such investments is reported in equity in earnings (losses) of investees and typically represents the Company s share of earnings of its investees. As part of the August 5, 2024 AG stock redemption, certain alternative investments were distributed to AGMH, whose results are reported in the Corporate Division. The carrying value of these transferred investments as of September 30, 2024 was 122 million.

 Net investment income for third quarter 2024 decreased compared with third quarter 2023, primarily due to lower income on Loss Mitigation Securities. Net investment income for nine months 2024 decreased compared with nine months 2023, primarily due to lower income on Loss Mitigation Securities, which were partially offset by higher short-term income as a result of higher short-term interest rates and higher average balances in the short-term investment portfolio. The overall pre-tax book yield of available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities and short-term investments was 4.10 as of September 30, 2024 and 4.04 as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Equity in earnings (losses) of investees for third quarter 2024 and nine months 2024 increased compared with third quarter 2023 and nine months 2023, primarily due to higher balances in the alternative investment portfolio and higher fair value gains on alternative investments. 
 
 Other Income (Loss) 
 
 The decrease in other income (loss) in nine months 2024, compared with nine months 2023 was primarily attributable to the reversal of a previously recorded litigation accrual of 20 million in nine months 2023. See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 11, Contingencies, for additional information. 
 
 Economic Loss Development (Benefit) 
 
 The insured portfolio includes policies accounted for under several different accounting models depending on the characteristics of the contract and the Company s control rights. For a discussion of methodologies and significant estimates for expected loss to be paid (recovered), see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4, Expected Loss to be Paid (Recovered), of the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The GAAP accounting policies for measurement and recognition for each type of contract are described in the notes listed below in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K:

Note 5 for contracts accounted for as insurance; 
 Note 6 for contracts accounted for as credit derivatives; 
 Note 8 for FG VIEs; and 
 Note 9 for fair value methodologies for credit derivatives and FG VIEs assets and liabilities. 
 
 In order to efficiently evaluate and manage the economics of the entire insured portfolio, management compiles and analyzes expected loss information for all policies on a consistent basis. The discussion of losses that follows encompasses expected losses on all contracts in the insured portfolio regardless of accounting model, unless otherwise specified. Net expected loss to be paid (recovered) is equal to the present value of expected future cash outflows for loss and LAE payments, net of: (i) inflows for expected salvage, subrogation and other recoveries; (ii) excess spread on underlying collateral, as applicable; and (iii) amounts ceded to reinsurers. Assumptions used in the determination of the net expected loss to be paid (recovered) such as delinquency, severity, discount rates and expected time frames to recovery are consistent by sector regardless of the accounting model used. 
 
 Current risk-free rates are used to discount expected losses at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in such rates from period to period affect economic loss development and loss and LAE. However, the effect of changes in discount rates is not indicative of actual credit impairment or improvement in the period. The weighted average discount rates used to discount expected losses (recoveries) for U.S. dollar denominated exposures were 3.74 and 4.10 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The weighted average discount rates used to discount expected losses (recoveries) for non-U.S. dollar denominated exposures were 3.94 and 3.28 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Third Quarter 2024 Net Economic Loss Development 
 
 Public Finance: The economic benefit of 23 million for U.S. public finance exposures was primarily attributable to certain healthcare exposures. The economic loss development of 46 million for non-U.S. public finance exposures was primarily attributable to certain U.K. regulated utilities. 
 
 U.S. RMBS : The economic benefit for U.S. RMBS was 56 million and was primarily attributable to a 29 million benefit from higher assumed recoveries for charged-off second lien loans and a 15 million benefit from higher assumed recoveries for deferred principal balances of modified first lien loans. 
 
 See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 4, Expected Loss to be Paid (Recovered), for additional information. 
 
 Third Quarter 2023 Net Economic Loss Development 
 
 Public Finance: The economic loss development on U.S. exposures of 135 million was primarily attributable to PREPA. 
 
 U.S. RMBS: The economic benefit attributable to U.S. RMBS of 48 million was primarily attributable to a 37 million benefit related to higher recoveries for secured second lien charged-off loans, an 11 million benefit related to changes in discount rates, and a 6 million benefit related to higher assumed recoveries for deferred principal in first lien transactions, partially offset by losses related to lower excess spread. 
 
 Nine Months 2024 Net Economic Loss Development 
 
 Public Finance: The economic benefit of 14 million for U.S. public finance exposures was primarily attributable to certain healthcare exposures, partially offset by higher expected loss adjustment expenses related to certain Puerto Rico exposures. The economic loss development of 63 million for non-U.S. public finance exposures was primarily attributable to certain U.K. regulated utilities and healthcare exposures. 
 
 U.S. RMBS: The economic benefit for U.S. RMBS was 69 million and was mainly attributable to a 41 million benefit from higher assumed recoveries for charged-off first and second lien loans and a 15 million benefit from higher assumed recoveries for deferred principal first lien balances. 
 
 See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 4, Expected Loss to be Paid (Recovered), for additional information.

Table of Contents 

Nine Months 2023 Net Economic Loss Development 
 
 Public Finance: The economic loss development on U.S. public finance exposures was 193 million, which was primarily attributable to PREPA and healthcare exposures, partially offset by higher projected recoveries in other municipal exposures. 
 
 U.S. RMBS: The net benefit attributable to U.S. RMBS was 52 million and was mainly attributable to a 50 million benefit related to higher recoveries for secured second lien charged-off loans, an 11 million benefit related to improved performance in certain transactions, a 9 million benefit related to changes in discount rates, and a 6 million benefit related to higher assumed recoveries for deferred principal in first lien transactions. These benefits were partially offset by a 18 million loss development related to the return of certain funds previously received and 6 million related to lower excess spread. 
 
 Insurance Segment Loss Expense 
 
 The primary differences between net economic loss development and the amount reported as loss and LAE (benefit) in the consolidated statements of operations are that loss and LAE (benefit): (i) considers deferred premium revenue in the calculation of loss reserves for financial guaranty insurance contracts; (ii) eliminates loss and LAE related to FG VIEs; and (iii) does not include estimated losses on credit derivatives. 
 
 Insurance segment loss expense includes loss and LAE on financial guaranty insurance contracts and losses on credit derivatives, without giving effect to eliminations related to the consolidation of FG VIEs. 
 
 For financial guaranty insurance contracts, each transaction s expected loss to be expensed is compared with the deferred premium revenue of that transaction. Expected loss to be expensed represents past or expected future net claim payments that have not yet been expensed. Such amounts will be expensed in future periods as deferred premium revenue amortizes into income on financial guaranty insurance policies. Expected loss to be expensed is the Company s projection of incurred losses that will be recognized in future periods, excluding accretion of discount. When the expected loss to be expensed exceeds the deferred premium revenue, a loss is recognized in income for the amount of such excess. Therefore, the timing of loss recognition in income does not necessarily coincide with the timing of the actual credit impairment or improvement reported in net economic loss development. Transactions (particularly BIG transactions) acquired in business combinations or seasoned portfolios assumed from legacy financial guaranty insurers generally have the largest deferred premium revenue balances. To the extent that a BIG transaction has a large deferred premium revenue, the difference between economic development and loss and LAE may be significant. 
 
 While expected loss to be paid (recovered) is an important measure that provides the present value of amounts that the Company expects to pay or recover in future periods regardless of accounting model, expected loss to be expensed is important because it presents the Company s projection of net expected losses that will be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in future periods as deferred premium revenue amortizes into income for financial guaranty insurance policies. 
 
 The amount of Insurance segment loss expense, which includes losses on policies regardless of form, is a function of the amount of economic loss development discussed above and the deferred premium revenue amortization in a given period, on a contract-by-contract basis. The following table presents the Insurance segment loss expense (benefit).

expenses in third quarter 2024 and nine months 2024, compared with third quarter 2023 and nine months 2023, was primarily due to expenses related to the Sound Point Transaction and AHP Transaction in 2023, and a value added tax adjustment in nine months 2023, partially offset by increases in premises related expenses in nine months 2024. Transaction related expenses in the Corporate division for Sound Point and AHP were 14 million for third quarter 2023 and 40 million for nine months 2023. 

Other (Effect of Consolidating FG VIEs and CIVs) 
 
 The effect of consolidating FG VIEs and CIVs, intersegment eliminations and reclassifications of reimbursable fund expenses to revenue are presented in other. See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 2, Segment Information. 
 
 As described in Note 8, Financial Guaranty Variable Interest Entities and Consolidated Investment Vehicles, the types of entities the Company consolidates when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary primarily include: (i) FG VIEs; and (ii) CIVs, The Company eliminates the effects of intercompany transactions between its FG VIEs and CIVs and its insurance and asset management subsidiaries, as well as intercompany transactions between CIVs. 
 
 Consolidating FG VIEs (as opposed to accounting for the related insurance contracts in the Insurance segment) has a significant gross-up effect on the consolidated financial statements, and includes: (i) the establishment of the FG VIEs assets and liabilities and related changes in fair value on the condensed consolidated financial statements; (ii) eliminating the premiums and losses/recoveries associated with the financial guaranty insurance contracts between the insurance subsidiaries and the FG VIEs; and (iii) eliminating the investment balances associated with the insurance subsidiaries purchases of the debt obligations of the FG VIEs. 
 
 Consolidating CIVs (as opposed to accounting for them as equity method investments) has a significant effect on assets, liabilities and cash flows, and includes: (i) the establishment of the assets and liabilities of the CIVs, and related changes in fair value; (ii) eliminating the asset management fees earned by AssuredIM from the CIVs (prior to July 1, 2023); (iii) eliminating the equity method investments of the insurance subsidiaries and AGAS, and related equity in earnings (losses) of investees; and (iv) establishing noncontrolling interest for amounts not owned by the Company. The economic effect of the U.S Insurance Subsidiaries ownership interests in CIVs is presented in the Insurance segment as equity in earnings (losses) of investees, while the effect of CIVs is presented as separate line items fair value gains (losses) on consolidated investment vehicles and noncontrolling interest on a consolidated basis. 
 
 The table below reflects the effect of consolidating FG VIEs and CIVs on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The amounts represent: (i) the revenues and expenses of the FG VIEs and the CIVs and (ii) the consolidation adjustments and eliminations between consolidated FG VIEs or CIVs and the operating and investment subsidiaries.

 Non-Credit Impairment-Related Unrealized Fair Value Gains (Losses) on Credit Derivatives 
 
 Changes in the fair value of credit derivatives occur because of changes in the Company s own credit rating and credit spreads, collateral credit spreads, notional amounts, credit ratings of the referenced entities, expected terms, realized gains (losses) and other settlements, interest rates and other market factors. The components of changes in fair value of credit derivatives related to credit derivative revenues and changes in expected losses are included in Insurance segment results. Non-credit impairment-related changes in unrealized fair value gains and losses on credit derivatives are not included in the Insurance segment measure of adjusted operating income because they do not represent actual claims or losses and are expected to reverse to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date. Changes in the fair value of the Company s credit derivatives that do not reflect actual or expected claims or credit losses have no impact on the Company s statutory claims-paying resources, rating agency capital or regulatory capital positions. Unrealized gains (losses) on credit derivatives may fluctuate significantly in future periods. Except for underlying credit impairment, which is recognized as loss expense in the Insurance segment, the fair value adjustments on credit derivatives in the insured portfolio are non-economic adjustments that reverse to zero over the remaining term of that portfolio. See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 9, Fair Value Measurement, for additional information. 
 
 96 

Table of Contents 

Nine months 2024 non-credit impairment-related unrealized fair value gains of 11 million were generated primarily due to the termination of certain structured finance policies. Third quarter 2023 and nine months 2023 non-credit impairment unrealized fair value gains of 6 million and 109 million, respectively, were generated primarily as a result of generally lower collateral asset spreads and a widening of AG s CDS spreads. 
 
 Fair Value Gains (Losses) on CCS 
 
 Fair value losses on CCS of 3 million, 20 million, 12 million and 35 million in third quarter 2024, third quarter 2023, nine months 2024 and nine months 2023, respectively, were primarily due to a tightening in market spreads. Fair value gains (losses) of CCS are heavily affected by, and in part fluctuate with, changes in market spreads and interest rates, credit spreads and other market factors and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Gain (Loss) on Remeasurement 
 
 Foreign exchange gains and losses of 54 million gains, 37 million losses, 42 million gains and 9 million gains in third quarter 2024, third quarter 2023, nine months 2024 and nine months 2023, respectively, primarily relate to remeasurement of long-dated premiums receivable, for which the Company records the present value of future installment premiums, and are mainly due to changes in the exchange rate of the pound sterling and, to a lesser extent, the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Approximately 69 and 70 of gross premiums receivable, net of commissions payable, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the pound sterling and euro. Premiums on European infrastructure and structured finance transactions typically are paid, in whole or in part, on an installment basis, whereas premiums on U.S. public finance transactions are often paid upfront. 
 
 The following table presents the foreign exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The Company discloses both: (i) financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP; and (ii) financial measures not determined in accordance with GAAP (non-GAAP financial measures). Financial measures identified as non-GAAP should not be considered substitutes for GAAP financial measures. The primary limitation of non-GAAP financial measures is the potential lack of comparability to financial measures of other companies, whose definitions of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those of the Company. 
 
 The Company believes its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides information that is necessary for analysts to calculate their estimates of Assured Guaranty s financial results in their research reports on Assured Guaranty and for investors, analysts and the financial news media to evaluate Assured Guaranty s financial results. 
 
 GAAP requires the Company to consolidate entities where it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary which include: 
 FG VIEs, which the Company does not own and where its exposure is limited to its obligation under the financial guaranty insurance contract, and 
 CIVs in which certain subsidiaries invest. 
 
 The Company discloses the effect of FG VIE and CIV consolidation that is embedded in each non-GAAP financial measure, as applicable. The Company believes this information may also be useful to analysts and investors evaluating Assured Guaranty s financial results. In the case of both the consolidated FG VIEs and the CIVs, the economic effect on the Company of each of the consolidated FG VIEs and CIVs is reflected primarily in the results of the Insurance segment. 
 
 Management of the Company and AGL s Board of Directors use non-GAAP financial measures further adjusted to remove the effect of FG VIE and CIV consolidation (which the Company refers to as its core financial measures), as well as GAAP financial measures and other factors, to evaluate the Company s results of operations, financial condition and progress towards long-term goals. The Company uses core financial measures in its decision-making process for and in its calculation of 
 97 

Table of Contents 

certain components of management compensation. The financial measures that the Company uses to help determine compensation are: (1) adjusted operating income, further adjusted to remove the effect of FG VIE and CIV consolidation; (2) adjusted operating shareholders equity, further adjusted to remove the effect of FG VIE and CIV consolidation; (3) adjusted book value per share, further adjusted to remove the effect of FG VIE and CIV consolidation; and (4) PVP. 
 
 Management believes that many investors, analysts and financial news reporters use adjusted operating shareholders equity and/or adjusted book value, each further adjusted to remove the effect of FG VIE and CIV consolidation, as the principal financial measures for valuing AGL s current share price or projected share price and also as the basis of their decision to recommend, buy or sell AGL s common shares. Management also believes that many of the Company s fixed income investors also use adjusted operating shareholders equity, further adjusted to remove the effect of FG VIE and CIV consolidation, to evaluate the Company s capital adequacy. 
 
 Adjusted operating income, further adjusted for the effect of FG VIE and CIV consolidation, enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company s financial results in comparison with the consensus analyst estimates distributed publicly by financial databases. 
 
 The following paragraphs define each non-GAAP financial measure disclosed by the Company and describe why it is useful. To the extent there is a directly comparable GAAP financial measure, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is presented below. 
 
 Adjusted Operating Income 
 
 Management believes that adjusted operating income is a useful measure because it clarifies the understanding of the operating results of the Company. Adjusted operating income is defined as net income (loss) attributable to AGL, as reported under GAAP, adjusted for the following: 
 
 1) Elimination of realized gains (losses) on the Company s investments, except for gains and losses on securities classified as trading. The timing of realized gains and losses, which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of sales is largely subject to the Company s discretion and influenced by market opportunities, as well as the Company s tax and capital profile. 
 
 2) Elimination of non-credit impairment-related unrealized fair value gains (losses) on credit derivatives that are recognized in net income, which is the amount of unrealized fair value gains (losses) in excess of the present value of the expected estimated economic credit losses, and non-economic payments. Such fair value adjustments are heavily affected by, and in part fluctuate with, changes in market interest rates, the Company s credit spreads, and other market factors and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss. 
 
 3) Elimination of fair value gains (losses) on the Company s CCS that are recognized in net income. Such amounts are affected by changes in market interest rates, the Company s credit spreads, price indications on the Company s publicly traded debt and other market factors and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss. 
 
 4) Elimination of foreign exchange gains (losses) on remeasurement of net premium receivables and loss and LAE reserves that are recognized in net income. Long-dated receivables and loss and LAE reserves represent the present value of future contractual or expected cash flows. Therefore, the current period s foreign exchange remeasurement gains (losses) are not necessarily indicative of the total foreign exchange gains (losses) that the Company will ultimately recognize. 
 
 5) The tax effects related to the above adjustments, which are determined by applying the statutory tax rate in each of the jurisdictions that generate these adjustments. 
 
 See Results of Operations Reconciliation to GAAP for a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to AGL to adjusted operating income (loss). 
 
 Adjusted Operating Shareholders Equity and Adjusted Book Value 
 
 Management believes that adjusted operating shareholders equity is a useful measure because it excludes the fair value adjustments on investments, credit derivatives and CCS that are not expected to result in economic gain or loss. 
 
 98 

Table of Contents 

Adjusted operating shareholders equity is defined as shareholders equity attributable to AGL, as reported under GAAP, adjusted for the following: 
 
 1) Elimination of non-credit impairment-related unrealized fair value gains (losses) on credit derivatives, which is the amount of unrealized fair value gains (losses) in excess of the present value of the expected estimated economic credit losses, and non-economic payments. Such fair value adjustments are heavily affected by, and in part fluctuate with, changes in market interest rates, credit spreads and other market factors and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss. 
 
 2) Elimination of fair value gains (losses) on the Company s CCS. Such amounts are affected by changes in market interest rates, the Company s credit spreads, price indications on the Company s publicly traded debt and other market factors and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss. 
 
 3) Elimination of unrealized gains (losses) on the Company s investments that are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The AOCI component of the fair value adjustment on the investment portfolio is not deemed economic because the Company generally holds these investments to maturity and therefore would not recognize an economic gain or loss. 
 
 4) The tax effects related to the above adjustments, which are determined by applying the statutory tax rate in each of the jurisdictions that generate these adjustments. 
 Management uses adjusted book value, further adjusted to remove the effect of FG VIE and CIV consolidation, to measure the intrinsic value of the Company, excluding franchise value. Adjusted book value per share, further adjusted for FG VIE and CIV consolidation (core adjusted book value), is one of the key financial measures used in determining the amount of certain long-term compensation elements to management and employees and used by rating agencies and investors. Management believes that adjusted book value is a useful measure because it enables an evaluation of the Company s in-force premiums and revenues net of expected losses. Adjusted book value is adjusted operating shareholders equity, as defined above, further adjusted for the following: 
 
 1) Elimination of deferred acquisition costs, net. These amounts represent net deferred expenses that have already been paid or accrued and will be expensed in future accounting periods. 
 
 2) Addition of the net present value of estimated net future revenue. See below. 
 
 3) Addition of the deferred premium revenue on financial guaranty contracts in excess of expected loss to be expensed, net of reinsurance. This amount represents the present value of the expected future net earned premiums, net of the present value of expected losses to be expensed, which are not reflected in GAAP equity. 
 
 4) The tax effects related to the above adjustments, which are determined by applying the statutory tax rate in each of the jurisdictions that generate these adjustments. 
 
 The unearned premiums and revenues included in adjusted book value will be earned in future periods, but actual earnings may differ materially from the estimated amounts used in determining current adjusted book value due to changes in foreign exchange rates, prepayment speeds, terminations, credit defaults and other factors.

 Net Present Value of Estimated Net Future Revenue 
 
 Management believes that this amount is a useful measure because it enables an evaluation of the present value of estimated net future revenue for non-financial guaranty insurance contracts. This amount represents the net present value of estimated future revenue from these contracts (other than credit derivatives with net expected losses), net of reinsurance, ceding commissions and premium taxes. 
 
 Future installment premiums are discounted at the approximate average pre-tax book yield of fixed-maturity securities purchased during the prior calendar year, other than Loss Mitigation Securities. The discount rate is recalculated annually and updated as necessary. Net present value of estimated future revenue for an obligation may change from period to period due to a change in the discount rate or due to a change in estimated net future revenue for the obligation, which may change due to changes in foreign exchange rates, prepayment speeds, terminations, credit defaults or other factors that affect par outstanding or the ultimate maturity of an obligation. There is no corresponding GAAP financial measure. 
 
 PVP or Present Value of New Business Production 
 
 Management believes that PVP is a useful measure because it enables the evaluation of the value of new business production in the Insurance segment by taking into account the value of estimated future installment premiums on all new contracts underwritten in a reporting period as well as additional installment premiums and fees on existing contracts (which may result from supplements or fees or from the issuer not calling an insured obligation the Company projected would be called), regardless of form, which management believes GAAP gross written premiums and changes in fair value of credit derivatives do not adequately measure. PVP in respect of contracts written in a specified period is defined as gross upfront and installment premiums received and the present value of gross estimated future installment premiums. 
 
 Future installment premiums are discounted at the approximate average pre-tax book yield of fixed-maturity securities purchased during the prior calendar year, other than certain fixed-maturity securities such as Loss Mitigation Securities. The discount rate is recalculated annually and updated as necessary. Under GAAP, financial guaranty installment premiums are 
 100 

Table of Contents 

discounted at a risk-free rate. Additionally, under GAAP, management records future installment premiums on financial guaranty insurance contracts covering non-homogeneous pools of assets based on the contractual term of the transaction, whereas for PVP purposes, management records an estimate of the future installment premiums the Company expects to receive, which may be based upon a shorter period of time than the contractual term of the transaction. 
 
 Actual installment premiums may differ from those estimated in the Company s PVP calculation due to factors including, but not limited to, changes in foreign exchange rates, prepayment speeds, terminations, credit defaults or other factors that affect par outstanding or the ultimate maturity of an obligation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

AGL and its U.S. Holding Companies 
 
 AGL directly owns (i) AG Re, an insurance company domiciled in Bermuda; and (ii) AGUS, a U.S. holding company with public debt outstanding. AGUS directly owns AGMH, a U.S. holding company with public debt outstanding. As of August 1, 2024, AGMH directly owns AG, an insurance company domiciled in Maryland. Until August 1, 2024, AGMH directly owned AGM, an insurance company domiciled in New York. See Overview Key Business Strategies Merger of the U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries above. AGUS and AGMH are collectively referred to as the U.S. Holding Companies. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Funds 
 
 The liquidity of AGL and its U.S. Holding Companies is largely dependent on dividends, stock redemptions and other distributions from their operating subsidiaries (see Insurance Subsidiaries Distributions from Insurance Subsidiaries below) and access to external financing. The operating liquidity requirements of AGL and the U.S. Holding Companies include: 
 
 principal and interest on debt issued by AGUS and AGMH; 
 dividends on AGL s common shares; and 
 the payment of operating expenses. 
 
 AGL and its U.S. Holding Companies may also require liquidity to: 
 
 make capital investments in their operating subsidiaries and in alternative investments; 
 fund acquisitions of new businesses; 
 purchase or redeem the Company s outstanding debt; or 
 repurchase AGL s common shares pursuant to AGL s share repurchase authorization. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company evaluates its liquidity needs and capital resources in light of holding company expenses and dividend policy, as well as rating agency considerations. The Company also subjects its cash flow projections and its assets to a stress test, maintaining a liquid asset balance of one and a half times its stressed operating company net cash flows. Management believes that AGL will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its needs over the next twelve months. See Overview Key Business Strategies, Capital Management above for information on common share repurchases. 
 
 Long-Term Debt Obligations 
 
 The Company has outstanding long-term debt issued by the U.S. Holding Companies. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Guarantor and U.S. Holding Companies' Summarized Financial Information below.

 (3) Represents principal amount of Junior Subordinated Debentures issued by AGMH that has been purchased by AGUS. 
 
 From time to time, AGL and its subsidiaries have entered into intercompany loan facilities. For example, on October 25, 2013, AGL, as borrower, and AGUS, as lender, entered into a revolving credit facility pursuant to which AGL may, from time to time, borrow for general corporate purposes. Under the credit facility, AGUS committed to lend a principal amount not exceeding 225 million in the aggregate. The commitment under the revolving credit facility terminates on October 25, 2033 (the loan commitment termination date). The unpaid principal amount of each loan will bear semi-annual interest at a fixed rate equal to 100 of the then applicable interest rate as determined under Internal Revenue Code Section 1274(d). Accrued interest on all loans will be paid on the last day of each June and December and at maturity. AGL must repay unpaid principal amounts of the loans, if any, by the third anniversary of the loan commitment termination date. AGL has not drawn upon the credit facility. 
 
 For more information, see the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities. 
 
 Guarantor and U.S. Holding Companies Summarized Financial Information

The following table presents significant cash flow items for AGL and the U.S. Holding Companies (other than investment income, operating expenses and taxes) related to distributions from subsidiaries and outflows for debt service, dividends and other capital management activities.

 (2) See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 12, Shareholders Equity, for additional information about share repurchases and authorizations. 
 
 Generally, dividends paid by a U.S. company to a Bermuda holding company are subject to a 30 withholding tax. After AGL became tax resident in the U.K., it became subject to the tax rules applicable to companies resident in the U.K., including the benefits afforded by the U.K. s tax treaties. The income tax treaty between the U.K. and the U.S. reduces or eliminates the U.S. withholding tax on certain U.S. sourced investment income (to 5 or 0 ), including dividends from U.S. subsidiaries to U.K. resident persons entitled to the benefits of the treaty. 
 
 For more information, see also Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 External Financing 
 
 From time to time, AGL and its subsidiaries have sought external debt or equity financing in order to meet their obligations. External sources of financing may or may not be available to the Company and, if available, the cost of such financing may not be acceptable to the Company. 

Insurance Subsidiaries 
 
 The Company has several insurance subsidiaries. AG is an insurance subsidiary domiciled in Maryland. As of August 1, 2024, AG owns: (i) AGUK, an insurance subsidiary domiciled in the U.K; and (ii) AGE, an insurance company domiciled in France. Until August 1, 2024, AGM was an insurance subsidiary of the Company domiciled in New York. See Overview Key Business Strategies Merger of the U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries above. AGUK and AGE are collectively referred to as the European Insurance Subsidiaries. AG Re is an insurance company domiciled in Bermuda that owns AGRO, an insurance company that is also domiciled in Bermuda. 
 
 108 

Table of Contents 

Sources and Uses of Funds 
 
 Liquidity of the insurance subsidiaries is primarily used to pay for: 
 
 operating expenses, 
 claims on the insured portfolio, 
 dividends or other distributions to parent, 
 reinsurance premiums, and 
 capital investments in their own subsidiaries and in alternative investments. 
 
 Management believes that the insurance subsidiaries liquidity needs for the next twelve months can be met from current cash, short-term investments and operating cash flow, including premium collections and coupon payments as well as scheduled maturities and paydowns from their respective investment portfolios. The Company generally targets a balance of its most liquid assets including cash and short-term securities, U.S. Treasuries, agency RMBS and pre-refunded municipal bonds equal to 1.5 times its projected operating company cash flow needs over the next four quarters. As of September 30, 2024, the Company intended to hold and had the ability to hold securities in an unrealized loss position until the date of anticipated recovery of amortized cost. 
 
 Beyond the next twelve months, the ability of the operating subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends may be influenced by a variety of factors, including market conditions, general economic conditions and, in the case of the Company s insurance subsidiaries, insurance regulations and rating agency capital requirements. 
 
 Financial Guaranty Policies 
 
 Insurance policies issued provide, in general, that payments of principal, interest and other amounts insured may not be accelerated by the holder of the obligation. Amounts paid by the Company therefore are typically in accordance with the obligation s original payment schedule, unless the Company accelerates such payment schedule, at its sole option. Premiums received on financial guaranty contracts are paid either upfront or in installments over the life of the insured obligations. 
 
 Payments made in settlement of the Company s obligations arising from its insured portfolio may, and often do, vary significantly from year to year, depending primarily on the frequency and severity of payment defaults and whether the Company chooses to accelerate its payment obligations in order to mitigate future losses. For example, the Company made substantial claim payments in 2022 in connection with the resolution of certain Puerto Rico credits, and will continue to pay the debt service on the remaining PRHTA insured obligations with a net par outstanding of 228 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company is continuing its efforts to resolve the one remaining unresolved Puerto Rico insured exposure that is in payment default, PREPA. The Company had 531 million in insured net par outstanding of PREPA obligations as of September 30, 2024. For more information, see Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 3, Outstanding Exposure, and Note 8, Financial Guaranty Variable Interest Entities and Consolidated Investment Vehicles. 
 
 The terms of the Company s credit default swaps (CDS) contracts generally are modified from standard CDS contract forms approved by International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. such that the circumstances giving rise to the Company s obligation to make loss payments are similar to those for its financial guaranty insurance contracts. The documentation for certain CDS was negotiated to require the Company to also pay if the obligor were to become bankrupt or if the reference obligation were restructured. Furthermore, some CDS documentation requires the Company to make a payment due to an event that is unrelated to the performance of the obligation referenced in the credit derivative. If events of default or termination events specified in the credit derivative documentation were to occur, the Company may be required to make a cash termination payment to its swap counterparty upon such termination. Any such payment would probably occur prior to the maturity of the reference obligation and be in an amount larger than the amount due for that period on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
 
 Ordinary Dividends From Insurance Subsidiaries to Holding Companies 
 
 The Company anticipates that, for the next twelve months, amounts paid by AGL s direct and indirect insurance subsidiaries as dividends or other distributions will be a major source of the holding companies liquidity. The insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends depends upon their financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, other potential uses for such funds and compliance with rating agency requirements, and is also subject to restrictions contained in the insurance laws and related regulations of their states of domicile. For more information, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15, Insurance Company Regulatory Requirements, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of the Company s dividend restrictions applicable to AG, AG Re and AGRO. 
 109 

Table of Contents 

Dividend restrictions by insurance subsidiary are as follows: 
 
 Effective August 1, 2024, AGM merged with and into AG, with AG as the surviving company. See Overview Key Business Strategies Merger of the U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries above. The Company expects the amount of ordinary dividends available for distribution by AG in 2024 to be approximately 400 million. After giving effect to the respective 49 million and 59 million ordinary dividend amounts paid by AGM and AG (together, the U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries) in 2024 prior to the merger, and 154 million ordinary dividend paid by AG after the merger, the amount available for distribution in the fourth quarter of 2024 is approximately 138 million. 
 
 Based on the applicable law and regulations, in 2024 AG Re paid dividends of 47 million in the first nine months of the year and has the capacity to declare and pay additional dividends in 2024 in an aggregate amount up to 110 million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, in 2024 AG Re can make capital distributions in an aggregate amount up to 129 million without the prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority.

 (1) Prior to the merger of AGM with and into AG, with AG as the surviving company, AG had been directly owned by AGUS. As a result of the merger, effective as of August 1, 2024, AG is directly owned by AGMH, a subsidiary of AGUS. 
 
 Stock Redemptions by Insurance Subsidiaries 
 
 In May 2024, NYDFS approved, and AGM implemented, the redemption of approximately 100 million of AGM s shares of common stock from AGMH. 
 
 In connection with the merger of AGM into AG, the MIA approved, and in third quarter 2024 AG implemented, the redemption of approximately 300 million of AG s shares of common stock from AGMH in exchange for cash of 167 million and the remainder in alternative investments. 
 
 Committed Capital Securities 
 
 AG is party to an arrangement that enables it to access, at its discretion, up to 400 million of capital, at any time, and has the right to use such capital for any purpose, including to pay claims. See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 9, Fair Value Measurement. 

Investment Portfolio 
 
 The Company s principal objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to: support the highest possible ratings for each operating company, manage investment risk within the context of the underlying portfolio of insurance risk, maintain sufficient liquidity to cover unexpected stress in the insurance portfolio, and maximize after-tax net investment income. Approximately 88 of the total available-for-sale fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed by external parties. In accordance with the Company s investment guidelines, each of the three external investment managers is required to maintain the Company s investment portfolio with an overall credit quality rated at a minimum of A+/A1/A+ by S P/Moody s/Fitch Inc., respectively. 
 
 Changes in interest rates affect the value of the Company s fixed-maturity securities. As interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-maturity securities generally increases and, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-maturity securities generally decreases. The Company s portfolio of fixed-maturity securities primarily consists of investment-grade, liquid

instruments. Other invested assets include other alternative investments, which are generally less liquid.

See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17, Leases, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a table of minimum lease obligations and other lease commitments. 

FG VIEs and CIVs 
 
 The Company manages its liquidity needs by evaluating cash flows without the effect of consolidating FG VIEs and CIVs; however, the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements include the effect of consolidating FG VIEs and CIVs. The primary sources and uses of cash at Assured Guaranty s FG VIEs and CIVs are as follows: 
 
 FG VIEs. The primary sources of cash in FG VIEs are the collection of principal and interest on the collateral supporting the debt obligations, and the primary uses of cash are the payment of principal and interest due on the debt obligations. The insurance subsidiaries are not primarily liable for the debt obligations issued by the VIEs they insure and would only be required to make payments on those insured debt obligations in the event that the issuer of such debt obligations defaults on any principal or interest due and only for the amount of the shortfall. AGL s and its insurance subsidiaries creditors do not have any rights with regard to the collateral supporting the debt issued by the FG VIEs. The remaining liabilities of the Puerto Rico Trusts are payable by AG under its financial guaranty policies and are no longer dependent on the credit of PRHTA. 
 
 CIVs. The primary sources and uses of cash in the CIVs include using capital to make investments, generating cash income from investments, paying expenses, distributing cash flow to investors and borrowing funds to finance 
 114

investments. The assets and liabilities of the Company s CIVs are held within separate legal entities. The assets of the CIVs are not available to creditors of the Company, other than creditors of the applicable CIVs. In addition, creditors of the CIVs have no recourse against the assets of the Company, other than the assets of such applicable CIVs. Liquidity available at the Company s CIVs is not available for corporate liquidity needs, except to the extent of the Company s investment in the funds, subject to redemption provisions. 
 
 See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 8, Financial Guaranty Variable Interest Entities and Consolidated Investment Vehicles, for additional information. 

Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows 
 
 The summarized condensed consolidated statements of cash flows in the table below present the cash flow effect for the aggregate of the Insurance and Asset Management businesses and holding companies, separately from the aggregate effect of consolidating FG VIEs and CIVs. In the third quarter 2023, as a result of the Sound Point Transaction and AHP Transaction, the Company deconsolidated all CLOs and CLO warehouses and certain funds. Therefore, beginning July 1, 2023, the Company s cash flow statements no longer includes all the operating, investing and financing cash flow activity of those deconsolidated CIVs. See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 1, Business and Basis of Presentation, and Note 8, Financial Guaranty Variable Interest Entities and Consolidated Investment Vehicles, for additional information.

 (1) Claims paid on consolidated FG VIEs are presented in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as a component of paydowns on FG VIEs liabilities in financing activities as opposed to operating activities. 
 
 Cash flows from operations, excluding FG VIEs and CIVs, was an outflow of 16 million in nine months 2024 and an outflow of 217 million in nine months 2023. The decrease in cash outflows, other than those of the FG VIEs and CIVs, during 
 115 

Table of Contents 

nine months 2024 was primarily due to a 97 million increase in premiums received, a 78 million decrease in net claim payments, a 31 million increase in return on capital from equity method investees, a 13 million increase in interest on short-term investments, and Sound Point Transaction and AHP Transaction expenses in 2023, which were partially offset by a 56 million increase in tax payments and the inclusion of cash flows for asset management subsidiaries in the nine months 2023 prior to the Sound Point Transaction. Cash flows from operations attributable to FG VIEs and CIVs were inflows in nine months 2024 and nine months 2023. Cash flow from operations in nine months 2023 included the operating activities of the CLOs and CLO warehouses in the first half of 2023 prior to the Sound Point Transaction. The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows present the investing activities of the consolidated Sound Point funds, which were formerly known as AssuredIM funds, and CLOs as cash flows from operations. 
 
 Investing activities primarily consisted of net sales (purchases) of fixed-maturity and short-term investments and paydowns on and sales of FG VIEs assets. The increase in investing cash inflows in nine months 2024 compared with the nine months 2023 was mainly attributable to net purchases of short-term and fixed-maturity securities in the nine months 2023, higher sales of trading securities in nine months 2024 and lower net sales of fixed-maturity securities in nine months 2024. Investing inflows in both periods were used to fund claim payments and share repurchases. See Item 1, Financial Statements, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and Note 3, Outstanding Exposure, for additional information. 
 
 Financing activities primarily consist of (i) AGL share repurchases and dividends, (ii) paydowns of FG VIEs liabilities, and (iii) until July 1, 2023, CLO issuances and CLO warehouse financing activities. The CIVs financing cash flows mainly included repayments of CLO warehouse financing debt and distributions from noncontrolling interests to CIVs. Nine months 2024 FG VIE financing cash flows included the par paydown of Puerto Rico Trust liabilities of 144 million. See Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 8, Financial Guaranty Variable Interest Entities and Consolidated Investment Vehicles. 
 
 From October 1, 2024 through November 8, 2024, the Company repurchased an additional 692,513 of common shares. As of November 8, 2024, the Company was authorized to purchase approximately 385 million of its common shares.
