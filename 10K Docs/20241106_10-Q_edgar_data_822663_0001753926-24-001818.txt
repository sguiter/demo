We have built a portfolio of prestige brands, which include Boucheron, Coach, Jimmy Choo, Karl Lagerfeld, Kate Spade, Lacoste, Lanvin, Moncler, Montblanc, Rochas and Van Cleef Arpels, whose products are distributed in over 120 countries around the world. Our exclusive and worldwide license for the production and distribution of Lacoste brand perfumes and cosmetics became effective in January 2024. 
 
 Through our United States based operations, we also produce and distribute fragrance and fragrance related products. United States based operations represented 33 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. These fragrance products are sold primarily pursuant to license or other agreements with the owners of the Abercrombie Fitch, Anna Sui, Donna Karan/DKNY, Emanual Ungaro, Ferragamo, Graff, GUESS, Hollister, MCM, Oscar de la Renta and Roberto Cavalli brands. 
 
 Substantially all of our prestige fragrance brands are licensed from unaffiliated third parties, and our business is dependent upon the continuation and renewal of such licenses. With respect to the Company s largest brands, we license the Jimmy Choo, Montblanc , Coach, GUESS, Donna Karan/DKNY, Lacoste, and Ferragamo brand names. 
 
 As a percentage of net sales, product sales for the Company s largest brands were as follows:

 Quarterly sales fluctuations are influenced by the timing of new product launches as well as the third and fourth quarter holiday season. In certain markets where we sell directly to retailers, seasonality is more evident. We primarily sell directly to retailers in France, the United States, and Italy. 
 
 We grow our business in two distinct ways. First, we grow by adding new brands to our portfolio, through new licenses or other arrangements, or outright acquisitions of brands. Second, we grow through the introduction of new products and by supporting new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling, as well as phasing out underperforming products, so we can devote greater resources to those products with greater potential. The economics of developing, producing, launching and supporting products influence our sales and operating performance each year. The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. 
 
 Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are received and stored directly at our third-party fillers or received at one of our distribution centers. For those components received at one of our distribution centers, based upon production needs, the components are subsequently sent to one of several third party fillers, which manufacture the finished product for us and then deliver them to one of our distribution centers. 
 
 As with any global business, many aspects of our operations are subject to influences outside our control. We believe we have a strong and well diversified brand portfolio with global reach and potential. As part of our strategy, we plan to continue to make investments behind fast-growing markets and channels to grow market share. 
 
 Our reported net sales are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as greater than 50 of net sales of our European based operations are denominated in U.S. dollars, while almost all costs of our European based operations are incurred in euro. We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments and primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 15.4 from the three months ended September 30, 2023 . At comparable foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 15.0 from the third quarter of 2023 . The average dollar/euro exchange rate for the current third quarter was 1.10 compared to 1.09 in the third quarter of 2023 , while the average dollar/euro exchange rate was 1.09 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.08 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 10.3 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Continuing the trend from the second quarter of 2024 , the current third quarter saw strong sales growth as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. This was driven by both the growing global fragrance market in combination with the addition of our newest brands, Lacoste and Roberto Cavalli, which contributed 10 to the increase. 
 
 For European based operations, Jimmy Choo and Montblanc sales grew by 17 and 10 , respectively, compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, driven by the launch of Jimmy Choo I Want Choo Le Parfum and the ongoing strength in the Montblanc Explorer and Legend lines. Sales of Coach remained flat as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. This was largely driven by the substantial increase in sales of Coach in the third quarter of 2023 of 32 as compared to the third quarter of 2022 . During the first quarter of 2024 , we began selling the Lacoste brand, which added 29 million and 68 million in sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. During the third quarter of 2024 , we rolled out the international launch of Lacoste Original and launched a new Karl Lagerfeld pillar, Ikonik . 
 
 Sales by our United States based operations grew a modest 8.7 in the third quarter of 2024 off a high 2023 base when third quarter sales had expanded 64 . The addition and extension of Roberto Cavalli contributed to the continued growth in United States based operations with the debut of Sweet Ferocious in August of this year. GUESS and Donna Karan/DKNY rose 16 and 4 , respectively, compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, following the roll-out of GUESS Iconic and DKNY 24 / 7 building upon the strong performance of our legacy scents for both brands. 
 
 The third quarter growth was in line with expectations, and we are confident in our future as we look forward to executing our plans for the remainder of 2024 . Our brands are in high demand in a robust environment for the fragrance industry, and we have many exciting developments planned for the Company. We have a large number of holiday programs planned as well as the launch of the Roberto Cavalli Wild Heart duo planned for the fourth quarter. While the pace of growth in the market is starting to slow down, the power of our diverse brand portfolio, in combination with our agile operating model, should help us gain market share.

The Company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 63.9 and 63.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to 63.9 and 63.3 for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The increase in the nine month period ending September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was driven by the impact of certain one-time expenses related to inventory in 2023 partially offset by un favorable segment, brand and channel mix in the current year. Gross profit margins remained flat from the same three month period in the prior year. 
 
 For European based operations, gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 66.2 and 66.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to 68.6 and 66.6 for the corresponding periods of the prior year. European based operations were negatively impacted by brand and channel mix during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period.

INTERPARFUMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 For United States based operations, gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 59.2 and 58.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to 55.6 and 56.7 for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The increase in both periods was driven by favorable brand and channel mix. 
 
 Generally, we do not bill customers for shipping and handling costs, and such costs, which aggregated 3.8 million and 8.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to 3.9 million and 11.4 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year , are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. As such, our Company s gross profit may not be comparable to other companies, which may include these expenses as a component of cost of goods sold. The improvement in shipping and handling costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to corresponding periods in 2023 is a direct benefit of lower transportation costs seen globally.

The Company s selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 38.9 and 41.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 40.2 and 39.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in the first three quarters of the year was largely driven by increased spending on promotional and advertising activities as compared to the prior year period. Additionally, starting in 2024 , the Company began to amortize the cost of the Lacoste license which represented 4.8 million during the first nine months of the year. These costs are being incurred at approximately 1.6 million quarterly over the remaining life of the license. The decrease in the third quarter was driven by the phasing of promotional and advertising activities by our European based operations discussed in detail below. 
 
 For European based operations, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9.6 and 15.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, and represented 38.3 and 41.5 of net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to 42.3 and 40.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. As discussed above, this increase is driven by increased promotion and advertising spending as well as the impact of the amortization of the Lacoste license. While promotion and advertising spend increased on a year to date basis, a portion of the activities planned for the third quarter were pushed into the fourth quarter resulting in a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the current quarter as compared to the prior year period. For United States based operations, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16.1 and 15.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, and represented 39.0 and 41.1 of net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to 36.5 and 39.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. The increase was largely driven by continued investment in infrastructure and headcount to support the growth of the business as well as increased promotional and advertising spending. 
 
 Promotion and advertising included in selling, general and administrative expenses aggregated 66.8 million and 181.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to 62.8 million and 152.6 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year and represented 15.7 and 16.6 of net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to 17.1 and 15.4 for the corresponding periods of the prior year. Promotion and advertising are integral parts of our industry, and we continue to invest heavily to support new pr oduct launches and to build brand awareness. We believe that our promotion and advertising efforts have a beneficial effect on sales. Historically, the Company incurred the majority of our promotional and advertising expenditures in the second half of the year. Beginning in 2024 , the Company implemented a strategy to increase spending in the first half of the year to better support and drive business growth throughout the year. Additionally, as the first three quarters of 2024 saw a lighter innovation program than prior years, the Company focused on increasing promotional and advertising spending to support the continued success of our existing brands and to support the initial launches of our new brands, Lacoste and Roberto Cavalli. We also continue to develop and implement omnichannel concepts and compelling content to deliver an integrated consumer experience. Long term, we continue to anticipate that on a full year basis, promotion and advertising expenditures will aggregate approximately 21 of net sales.

 Royalty expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses aggregated 34.0 million and 88.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to 29.1 million and 77.2 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year. Royalty expense represented 8.0 and 8.1 of net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to 7.9 and 7.8 of net sales for the corresponding periods of the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by unfavorable brand mix. 
 
 Income from Operations 
 
 As a result of the above analysis regarding net sales, gross profit margins and selling, general and administrative expenses, our operating margins aggregated 25.0 and 21.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to 23.7 and 23.5 for the corresponding periods of the prior year. 
 
 Other Income and Expense 
 
 Overall, other income and expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was a loss of 7.1 million as compared to a gain of 2.2 million in the corresponding prior year period. The main drivers of this change are discussed in more detail below. These include an increase in interest expense on borrowings of 0.3 million, a loss on foreign currency of 3.7 million, and a reduction of interest income related to cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 1.4 million. Additionally, there was a one-time gain of 3.1 million recognized in 2023 related to the sale of marketable securities. 
 
 Interest expense is primarily related to the financing of brand and licensing acquisitions. In December 2022, to finance the acquisition of the Lacoste trademark, the Company entered into a 56 million 50 million) four -year loan agreement. The loan agreement bears interest at EURIBOR- 1 month rates plus a margin of 0.825 . This variable rate debt was swapped for variable interest rate debt with a maximum rate of 2 per annum. Additionally, in April 2021, we completed the acquisition of the headquarters of Interparfums SA. The acquisition was financed by a 10 -year approximately 128.5 million 120 million) bank loan which bears interest at one -month Euribor plus 0.75 . Approximately 89.6 million 80 million) of the variable rate debt was swapped for fixed interest rate debt with a maximum interest rate of 2 per annum. The swap effectively exchanges the variable interest rate to a fixed rate of approximately 1.1 . Additionally in July 2024, the Company entered into a 44.8 million 40 million) three-year loan agreement that bears a fixed interest rate of 4.03 . The loan was used to purchase additional short-term investments. Long-term debt including current maturities aggregated 179.1 million and 157.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to receivables from unaffiliated third parties denominated in a foreign currency and occasionally to manage risks related to future sales expected to be denominated in a foreign currency. Greater than 50 of net sales of our European based operations are denominated in U.S. dollars. Gains and losses in derivatives designated as hedges are accumulated in other comprehensive income and gains and losses in derivatives not designated as hedges are included in (gain) loss on foreign currency on the accompanying consolidated income statements. Such gains and losses were immaterial in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 
 
 Interest and investment income represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and realized and unrealized gains and losses on marketable equity securities. Interest income was 2.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.9 million in the prior year period. As of September 30, 2024 , short-term investments also include approximately 8.9 million of marketable equity securities of other companies in the luxury goods sector. In the first quarter of 2023 , the Company sold marketable securities which generated a gain of 3.1 million. The Company purchased additional marketable securities throughout 2023 and in the first nine months of 2024 , resulting in an unrealized loss of 0.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 . 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Our consolidated effective tax rate was 23.7 and 23.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The effective tax rate for European based operations was 25.0 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , while the effective tax rate for United States based operations was 19.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to 18.8 for the corresponding period of the prior year. Our effective tax rate for United States based operations differs from the 21 statutory rate in the United States as it is a blended rate across multiple jurisdictions, and takes into account benefits received from the exercise of stock options as well as deductions we are allowed for a portion of our foreign derived intangible income, slightly offset by state and local taxes. Other than as discussed above, we did not experience any significant changes in tax rates, and none were expected in jurisdictions where we operate.

 Net income attributable to European based operations was 54.4 million and 132.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to 46.0 million and 133.5 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year, while net income attributable to United States based operations was 24.3 million and 49.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to 20.2 million and 46.1 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The significant fluctuations in net income for both European based operations and United States based operations are directly related to the previous discussions pertaining to changes in sales, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 
 The noncontrolling interest arises from our 72 owned subsidiary in Paris, Interparfums SA, which is also a publicly traded company as 28 of Interparfums SA shares trade on the Euronext. Net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is directly related to the profitability of our European based operations and aggregated 28 of European based operations net income for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Net profit margins attributable to Interparfums, Inc. for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 aggregated 12.8 and 14.4 , respectively. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our conservative financial tradition has enabled us to amass significant cash balances. As of September 30, 2024 , we had 157.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, most of which are held in euro by our European based operations and is readily convertible into U.S. dollars. We have not had any liquidity issues to date, and do not expect any liquidity issues relating to such cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , working capital aggregated 617 million. Approximately 76 of the Company s total assets are held by European based operations, and approximately 253 million of trademarks, licenses and other intangible assets are also held by European based operations. 
 
 The Company is party to a number of licenses and other agreements for the use of trademarks and rights in connection with the manufacture and sale of its products expiring at various dates through 2039 . In connection with most of these license agreements, the Company is subject to minimum annual advertising commitments, minimum annual royalties and other commitments. See Item 8 . Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 Commitments in our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference herein. Future advertising commitments are estimated based on planned future sales for the license terms that were in effect at December 31, 2023 , without consideration for potential renewal periods and do not reflect the fact that our distributors share our advertising obligations.

INTERPARFUMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 The Company hopes to continue to benefit from its strong financial position to potentially acquire one or more brands, either on a proprietary basis or as a licensee. Discussions have been underway since 2023 with a view to renewing the Van Cleef Arpels license agreement. The license is to be renewed for an additional 9 -year term, beginning January 1, 2025. In July 2023, we entered into a global licensing agreement for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances and fragrance related products under the Roberto Cavalli brand. Our rights under this license are subject to certain minimum advertising expenditures and royalty payments as are customary in our industry. This license took effect in July 2023, and we began shipping products in February 2024. 
 
 In December 2022, we entered into a long-term global licensing agreement for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances and fragrance related products under the Lacoste brand. Our rights under this license are subject to certain minimum advertising expenditures and royalty payments as are customary in our industry. This license took effect and products started to ship in January 2024. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities aggregated 49.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and compared to 24.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , working capital items used 147.0 million in cash from operating activities, as compared to 169.1 million in the 2023 period. Although from a cash flow perspective accounts receivables are up 41 from year end 2023 , the balance is reasonable based on third quarter 2024 record sales levels and seasonality of the business. While day s sales outstanding was 83 days, up from 71 days in the corresponding period of the prior year driven by changes in our channel mix, we are still seeing strong collection activity and do not anticipate any issues with collections of accounts receivable. From a cash flow perspective, inventory levels as of September 30, 2024 increased 9 from year end 2023 in support of our overall sales growth as well as the building up of inventory related to the inclusion of the Lacoste and Roberto Cavalli licenses which require large inventory needs to support the launches of these brands. Additionally, as we are working to manage down our inventory levels, we have seen increased conversion of raw materials into finished goods resulting in finished goods making up 63 of our inventory levels at September 30, 2024 as compared to 58 at September 30, 2023 . Due to past supply constraints, we had strived to carry more inventory overall, source the same components from multiple suppliers and when possible, manufacture products closer to where they are sold. These constraints have largely abated and we are gradually reversing some of these previous interventions. We are beginning to see the impacts of these recent inventory management efforts and will continue to work to optimize inventory levels. 
 
 Cash flows provided by investing activities in 2024 reflect purchases and sales of short-term investments. These investments consist of certificates of deposit with maturities greater than three months, marketable equity securities and other contracts. At September 30, 2024 , approximately 2.2 million of certificates of deposit contain penalties where we would forfeit a portion of the interest earned in the event of early withdrawal. 
 
 Our business is not capital intensive as we do not own any manufacturing facilities. On a full year basis, we typically spend approximately 5 million on tools and molds, depending on our new product development calendar. Capital expenditures also include amounts for office fixtures, computer equipment and industrial equipment needed at our distribution centers. 
 
 Cash flows used in financing activities in 2024 reflect issuances and repayments of debt and payment of dividends to stockholders. 
 
 Our short-term financing requirements are expected to be met by available cash on hand at September 30, 2024 , and by short-term credit lines provided by domestic and foreign banks. The principal credit facilities for 2024 consist of a 25 million unsecured revolving line of credit provided by a domestic commercial bank and approximately 8 million in credit lines provided by a consortium of international financial institutions. There was 9.0 million of short-term borrowings outstanding pursuant to these facilities as of September 30, 2024 and 4.5 million outstanding as of September 30, 2023 . 
 
 In February 2023, the Board of Directors authorized an annual dividend of 2.50 per share. In February 2024, the Board of Directors further increased the annual dividend to 3.00 per share. The next quarterly cash dividend of 0.75 per share is payable on December 31, 2024, to shareholders of record on December 16, 2024. 
 
 We believe that funds provided by or used in operations can be supplemented by our present cash position and available credit facilities, so that they will provide us with sufficient resources to meet all present and reasonably foreseeable future operating needs. 
 
 Inflation rates in the United States and foreign countries in which we operate did not have a significant impact on operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024

Item 3 : 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

General 
 
 We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that primarily consists of the use of derivative financial instruments. We primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in the trading of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or interest rate swaps. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Risk Management 
 
 We periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure related to receivables denominated in a foreign currency and to manage risks related to future sales expected to be denominated in a currency other than our functional currency. We enter into these exchange contracts for periods consistent with our identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the receivables and cash flows of Interparfums SA, whose functional currency is the euro. All foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions, which are rated as strong investment grade. 
 
 All derivative instruments are required to be reflected as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet measured at fair value. Generally, increases or decreases in fair value of derivative instruments will be recognized as gains or losses in earnings in the period of change. If the derivative is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, then the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument will be recorded in other comprehensive income. 
 
 Before entering into a derivative transaction for hedging purposes, we determine that the change in the value of the derivative will effectively offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item from a movement in foreign currency rates. Then, we measure the effectiveness of each hedge throughout the hedged period. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in the income statement. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts of approximately USD 21 million and GBP 7 million with maturities of less than one year. We believe that our risk of loss as the result of nonperformance by any of such financial institutions is remote. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 
 We mitigate interest rate risk by monitoring interest rates, and then determining whether fixed interest rates should be swapped for floating rate debt, or if floating rate debt should be swapped for fixed rate debt. 

Item 4 .
