 in and maintains its headquarters in Dallas, Texas, with additional office space in Davis and Sacramento, California. The Company was reincorporated in in . Since acquiring the assets of Live Zola, LLC ("Zola") in May 2021, the Company has provided consumers with a great tasting way to rehydrate, reset, and reenergize with Zola coconut water products. The company has leveraged its history as a leader in science-based approaches to develop high value products and drive innovation in the consumer goods industry. Previously, the Company developed products primarily in wheat, which it commercialized through the sales of seed, grain and food ingredients and products, and through trait licensing and royalty agreements. On May 16, 2024, the Company sold the GoodWheat brand to Above Food Ingredients Corp. ("Above Food") for net consideration of million. Refer to Note 6 for details of the transaction. On May 14, 2024, the Company sold its non-GMO Resistant Starch ("RS") durum wheat trait to longtime partner Corteva AgriScience ("Corteva"). Under the terms of the agreement, Arcadia retained certain rights to use the RS durum wheat trait. The Company received million in cash payment from Corteva during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and recorded a gain of the same amount as the trait had no carrying value on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss related to the transaction. Refer to Note 8 for details of the partnership and transaction. In May 2021, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary Arcadia Wellness, LLC Arcadia Wellness or AW acquired the businesses of Eko Holdings, LLC, Lief, LLC, and Zola. The acquisition included Saavy Naturals , a line of natural body care products, Soul Spring , a CBD-infused botanical therapy brand in the natural category, and ProVault , a THC-free CBD sports performance formula made with natural ingredients, providing effective support and recovery for athletes (collectively, "body care brands"). Also included in the purchase was Zola, a coconut water sourced exclusively with sustainably grown coconuts from Thailand. In July 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to license Saavy Naturals to Radiance Beauty and Wellness, Inc. ("Radiance Beauty"). In July 2023, management made the decision to exit the remaining body care brands, Soul Spring and ProVault, as a result of continued pressure on the CBD market due to regulatory uncertainty. Body care operations ceased during the third quarter of 2023. In August 2019, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Legacy Ventures Hawaii, LLC Legacy, see Note 7) to grow, extract, and sell hemp products. The partnership Archipelago Ventures Hawaii, LLC Archipelago ), combines the Company s extensive genetic expertise and resources with Legacy s experience in hemp extraction and sales. In October 2021, Arcadia and Legacy mutually agreed to wind down the cultivation activities of Archipelago, due to regulatory challenges and a saturated hemp market. In February 2012, the Company formed Verdeca, which was equally owned with Bioceres. Verdeca was formed to develop and deregulate soybean varieties using both partners agricultural technologies. In November 2020, Arcadia sold its membership interest in Verdeca to Bioceres in a transaction in which Arcadia received cash, shares of Bioceres stock and a royalty stream of up to million on sales of Haab 4 soybeans HB4 ). An additional million in cash was to be paid to Arcadia upon Verdeca achieving commercial plantings of at least 200,000 hectares of HB4 or China approving the HB4 soybean trait for food and feed . During 2022, Bioceres received China's approval of the HB4 soybean trait and as a result, Arcadia recorded license revenue of and a gain on sale of Verdeca of million on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company received the full payment of million as of December 31, 2023.

On F ebruary 15, 2023, the Company s stockholders approved the certificate of amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation, which the Company filed on February 27, 2023 with the Secretary of State of Delaware to effect the reverse split on March 1, 2023. As a result of the reverse stock split, additional shares of common stock were issued in lieu of fractional shares. All issued and outstanding common stock, options to purchase common stock and per share amounts contained in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented. 
 million, cash and cash equivalents of million, short-term investments of million and current note receivable of million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had net loss of million and net cash used in operations of million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company had net losses of million and net cash used in operations of million. With cash and cash equivalents of million, short-term investments of million and current note receivable of million as of September 30, 2024, the Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will not be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12-18 months from the issuance date of these financial statements, and thus raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company may seek to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings. The Company may also consider entering into additional partner arrangements. The sale of additional equity would result in dilution to the Company s stockholders. The incurrence of debt would result in debt service obligations, and the instruments governing such debt could provide for additional operating and financing covenants that would restrict operations. If the Company requires additional funds and is unable to secure adequate additional funding at terms agreeable to the Company, the Company may be forced to reduce spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets, or suspend or curtail planned product launches. Any of these actions could materially harm the business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company could be adversely affected by certain actions by the government as it relates to government contract revenue received in prior years. Government agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor s performance under its agreements; cost structure; and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. While the Company s management anticipates no adverse result from an audit, should any costs be found to be improperly allocated to a government agreement, such costs will not be reimbursed, or if already reimbursed, may need to be refunded. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments or fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the government could occur. In addition, serious reputational harm or significant adverse financial effects could occur if allegations of impropriety were made against the Company.

 Overview 
 Since acquiring the assets of Live Zola, LLC ("Zola") in May 2021, the Company has provided consumers with a great tasting way to rehydrate, reset, and reenergize with Zola coconut water products. The company has leveraged its history as a leader in science-based approaches to develop high value products and drive innovation in the consumer goods industry. Previously, the Company developed products primarily in wheat, which it commercialized through the sales of seed, grain and food ingredients and products, and through trait licensing and royalty agreements. 
 On May 16, 2024, the Company sold the GoodWheat brand to Above Food Ingredients Corp. ("Above Food") for net consideration of 3.7 million. Refer to Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details of the transaction. 
 On May 14, 2024, the Company sold its non-GMO Resistant Starch ("RS") durum wheat trait to longtime partner Corteva AgriScience ("Corteva"). Under the terms of the agreement, Arcadia retained certain rights to use the RS durum wheat trait. The Company received 4.0 million in cash payment from Corteva during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and recorded a gain of the same amount as the trait had no carrying value on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss related to the transaction. Refer to Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details of the partnership and transaction. 
 In May 2021, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary Arcadia Wellness, LLC Arcadia Wellness or AW acquired the businesses of Eko Holdings, LLC, Lief, LLC, and Zola. The acquisition included Saavy Naturals , a line of natural body care products, Soul Spring , a CBD-infused botanical therapy brand in the natural category, and ProVault , a THC-free CBD sports performance formula made with natural ingredients, providing effective support and recovery for athletes (collectively, "body care brands"). Also included in the purchase was Zola, a coconut water sourced exclusively with sustainably grown coconuts from Thailand. In July 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to license Saavy Naturals to Radiance Beauty and Wellness, Inc. ("Radiance Beauty"). In July 2023, management made the decision to exit the remaining body care brands, Soul Spring and ProVault, as a result of continued pressure on the CBD market due to regulatory uncertainty. Body care operations ceased during the third quarter of 2023.

Our Growth Strategy 
 We believe there are significant opportunities to grow our business by executing the following elements of our strategy: 
 Scale Zola through retail expansion. Based on our research, consumers prefer the clean, crisp taste of Zola to that of other leading coconut water brands. As a result, we plan to continue to invest in trial-driving activities and expand distribution of our Zola coconut water brand through mass market retailers and grocery store chains. 

Monetization of our wheat trait portfolio. Our proprietary intellectual property ("IP") with multiple non-GMO wheat traits have clear functional benefits, which we utilized to launch the GoodWheat brand into multiple categories. We believe our wheat provides a compelling point of difference and we will continue to evaluate ways to extract value from our proprietary technology. 

Evaluate M A opportunities. We intend to evaluate potential asset sales, mergers, acquisitions and other strategic opportunities. 

Our Product Portfolio 
 Zola Coconut Water 
 
 Founded in 2002, Zola became part of the Arcadia family of brands in May 2021. Sourced from Thailand, Zola is a pure, natural, 100 coconut water with a crisp, clean taste that s slightly sweet and refreshing. Naturally hydrating and rich in electrolytes, Zola is Non-GMO Project Verified and only contains 60 calories per serving. In taste tests, Zola beat competitors 2 to 1 and is the best tasting way to rehydrate, reset and reenergize. Zola flavors include original, original with pulp, and espresso, and in May 2024, we added lime and pineapple. 
 
 Wheat Traits 
 RG Wheat 
 
 Many consumers are interested in reducing levels of gluten in their diet. Critically, for some, this is due to having Celiac disease ("CD"), an autoimmune disease that impacts many people worldwide with estimates from 1 of the population in Europe to 3.5 in Mexico. Furthermore, non-celiac gluten sensitivity ("NCGS") impacts an estimated additional 6 of the population. Both CD and NCGS are characterized by sensitivity to dietary gluten. The only effective treatment of CD and NCGS requires removal of gluten sources from the diet. Since required adherence to a gluten-free diet is extremely difficult to accomplish for average consumers, efforts to develop alternative approaches are needed. 
 
 Our proprietary, non-GMO wheat variety developed using advanced screening and plant breeding techniques have reduced allergenic glutens and increased essential amino acids such as lysine, along with all the other health benefits of high protein wheat. Importantly, this variety also delivers impressively high fiber content at approximately 14 grams per serving compared to 2-3 grams per serving of traditional wheat, providing additional value to health-conscious consumers. 
 
 Improved Shelf Life of Whole Grain Flour 
 
 The United States Department of Agriculture recommends that at least one serving of grains per day must be whole grain-rich due to evidence that a diet containing whole grains provides a multitude of benefits, including lower risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes. Despite these health benefits, consumption of whole grain products is negatively affected by the bitter and rancid flavors and odors that accumulate in whole wheat flour after milling. Our improved stability and flavor wheat lines greatly reduced the production of rancid and bitter compounds in milled whole grain flour as it progresses through the supply chain.

 25 

Liquidity Capital Resources 
 We have funded our operations primarily with the net proceeds from our private and public offerings of our equity securities as well as proceeds from the sale of our products and payments under license agreements. Our principal use of cash is to fund our operations, which are primarily focused on commercializing our products. Our contractual obligations are primarily related to our operating leases for facilities, land and equipment. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 3.9 million, short-term investments of 2.6 million and current note receivable of 1.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had net losses of 3.0 million and net cash used in operations of 7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company had net losses of 14.0 million and net cash used in operations of 15.3 million. 
 Going Concern 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and current note receivable will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12-18 months from the issuance date of these financial statements, and thus raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 We may seek to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings, if necessary. We may also consider entering into additional partner arrangements. Any sale of additional equity would result in dilution to our stockholders. Our incurrence of debt would result in debt service obligations, and the instruments governing our debt could provide for additional operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. If we require additional funds and are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we may be forced to reduce our spending, extend payment terms with our suppliers, liquidate assets, or suspend or curtail planned product launches. Any of these actions could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Since our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities, or variable interest entities other than Verdeca, which was disposed of in November 2020. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated, and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 We consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be revenue recognition, determination of the provision for income taxes, and net realizable value of inventory.

ITEM 3:	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Not Required. 
 ITEM 4:	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation identified above that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
