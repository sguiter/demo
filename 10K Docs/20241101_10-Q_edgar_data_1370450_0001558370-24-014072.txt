 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this 10-Q contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements as that term is defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. These statements concern our business, operations and financial performance and condition as well as our plans, objectives and expectations for our business operations and financial performance and condition, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this 10-Q are forward-looking statements. These statements may include words such as aim, anticipate, assume, believe, can have, could, due, estimate, expect, goal, intend, likely, may, objective, plan, potential, positioned, predict, should, target, will, would and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events or trends. For example, all statements we make relating to our plans and objectives for future operations, growth or initiatives and strategies are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our business and the industry in which we operate and our management s beliefs and assumptions. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our own operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that predicting the impact of known factors is very difficult, and we cannot anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All of our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to: our ability to adequately complete projects in a timely manner; our ability to compete successfully in the highly competitive energy services market, which represented 84 of our consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2023; our reliance on work from our top ten clients, which accounted for 53 of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal year 2023; changes in state, local and regional economies and government budgets; our ability to win new contracts, to renew existing contracts and to compete effectively for contracts awarded through bidding processes; our ability to make principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt as they come due and to comply with the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements; our ability to manage supply chain constraints, labor shortages, rising interest rates, and rising inflation; our ability to obtain financing and to refinance our outstanding debt as it matures; our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions and execute on our growth strategy; and our ability to attract and retain managerial, technical, and administrative talent. 
 The above is not a complete list of factors or events that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, and we cannot predict all of them. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements disclosed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors , Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023, as such disclosures may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to

 the impact this update will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ). ASU 2023-07 expands segment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures related to significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM ), a description of other segment items by reportable segment, and any additional measures of a segment s profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources. All disclosure requirements under ASU 2023-07 are also required for public entities with a single reportable segment. The amendments are effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.

In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative ASU 2023-06 ). ASU 2023-06 amends U.S. GAAP to reflect updates and simplifications to certain disclosure and presentation requirements referred to FASB by the SEC. The targeted amendments incorporate 14 of the 27 disclosures referred by the SEC into codification. Each amendment in ASU 2023-06 is effective on either the date on which the SEC s removal of the related disclosure requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, or on June 30, 2027, if the SEC has not removed the requirements by that date. The Company does believe the amendments in ASU 2023-06 will have a material impact in any of the Company s current disclosures.

 reportable segments and the types of contracts that each most commonly enters into for revenue generating activities. Revenue on the vast majority of the Company s contracts is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. Revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method based generally on the ratio of direct costs incurred-to-date to estimated total direct costs at completion. The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method to better match the level of work performed at a certain point in time in relation to the effort that will be required to complete a project. In addition, the percentage-of-completion method is a common method of revenue recognition in the Company s industry. Many of the Company s fixed price contracts involve a high degree of subcontracted fixed price effort and, usually, are relatively short in duration, thereby lowering the risks of not properly estimating the percent complete. Revenue on time-and-materials and unit-based contracts is recognized as the work is performed in accordance with the specific rates and terms of the contract. The Company recognizes revenues for time-and-materials contracts based upon the actual hours incurred during a reporting period at contractually agreed upon rates per hour and also includes in revenue all reimbursable costs incurred during a reporting period. Certain of the Company s time-and-materials contracts are subject to maximum contract values and, accordingly, when revenue is expected to exceed the maximum contract value, these contracts are generally recognized under the percentage-of-completion method, consistent with fixed price contracts. For unit-based contracts, the Company recognizes the contract price of units of a basic production product as revenue when the production product is delivered during a period. Revenue for amounts that have been billed but not earned is deferred, and such deferred revenue is referred to as contract liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company also derives revenue from software licenses and professional services and maintenance fees. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company performs an assessment of each contract to identify the performance obligations, determine the overall transaction price for the contract, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognize the revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. The Company utilizes the residual approach by which it estimates the standalone selling price by reference to the total transaction price less the sum of the observable standalone selling prices of other goods or services promised in the contract. The software license revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the client, which is defined as the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the license. The software license is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without services, updates, or technical support. Related professional services include training and support services in which the standalone selling price is determined based on an input measure of hours incurred to total estimated hours and is recognized over time, which usually is the life of the contract.

 to of the Company s consolidated contract revenue. Contracts that cover multiple phases or elements of the project or service lifecycle (development, construction and maintenance and support) may be considered to have multiple performance obligations even when they are part of a single contract. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using the best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. For the periods presented, the value of the separate performance obligations under contracts with multiple performance obligations (generally measurement and verification tasks under certain energy performance contracts) were not material. In cases where the Company does not provide the distinct good or service on a standalone basis, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which the Company forecasts the Company s expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin for the distinct good or service. The Company provides quality of workmanship warranties to customers that are included in the sale and are not priced or sold separately or do not provide customers with a service in addition to assurance of compliance with agreed-upon specifications and industry standards. The Company does not consider these types of warranties to be separate performance obligations. In some cases, the Company has a master service or blanket agreement with a customer under which each task order releases the Company to perform specific portions of the overall scope in the service contract. Each task order is typically accounted for as a separate contract because the task order establishes the enforceable rights and obligations, and payment terms. Under ASC 606, variable consideration should be considered when determining the transaction price and estimates should be made for the variable consideration component of the transaction price, as well as assessing whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained. For certain of the Company s contracts, variable consideration can arise from modifications to the scope of services resulting from unapproved change orders or customer claims. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on assessments of legal enforceability, the Company s performance, and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.

 allocation of these costs is made to direct costs of contract revenue. allocation of facilities costs is made to direct costs of contract revenue. Other companies may classify as direct costs of contract revenue some of the costs that the Company classifies as general and administrative costs. The Company expenses direct costs of contract revenue when incurred. Included in revenue and costs are all reimbursable costs for which the Company has the risk or on which the fee was based at the time of bid or negotiation. revenue or cost is recorded for costs in which the Company acts solely in the capacity of an agent and has no risks associated with such costs. Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful accounts based upon a review of all outstanding amounts on a quarterly basis. Management determines allowances for doubtful accounts through specific identification of amounts considered to be uncollectible and potential write-offs, plus a non-specific allowance for other amounts for which some potential loss has been determined to be probable based on current and past experience. The Company s historical credit losses have been minimal with governmental entities and large public utilities, but disputes may arise related to these receivable amounts. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received. Retainage, included in contract assets, represents amounts withheld from billings to the Company s clients pursuant to provisions in the contracts and may not be paid to the Company until specific tasks are completed or the project is completed and, in some instances, for even longer periods. As of September 27, 2024 and December 29, 2023, contract assets included retainage of approximately million and million, respectively.

 , some of which may include options to the leases for up to , and some of which may include options to the leases within . Currently, all of the Company s leases contain fixed payment terms. The Company may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, in which case the Company is typically liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease. Additionally, all of the Company s month-to-month leases are cancelable by the Company or the lessor, at any time, and are not included in the Company s right-of-use asset or lease liability. As of September 27, 2024, the Company had leases with residual value guarantees. Typically, the Company has purchase options on the equipment underlying its long-term leases. The Company may exercise some of these purchase options when the need for equipment is on-going and the purchase option price is attractive. Nonperformance-related default covenants, cross-default provisions, subjective default provisions and material adverse change clauses contained in material lease agreements, if any, are also evaluated to determine whether those clauses affect lease classification in accordance with ASC Topic 842-10-25. Leases are accounted for as operating or financing leases, depending on the terms of the lease. Financing Leases The Company leases certain equipment under financing leases. The economic substance of the leases is a financing transaction for acquisition of equipment and leasehold improvements.

The interest associated with financing lease obligations is included in interest expense. Right-of-use assets Operating leases are included in right-of-use assets, and current portion of lease liability and noncurrent portion of lease liability, as appropriate. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate to calculate present value, the Company determines this rate by estimating the Company s incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred at lease commencement and excludes lease incentives. The Company s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 million, remaining unchanged from the end of fiscal year 2022. As of September 27, 2024, the Company assessed all available positive and negative evidence available to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, there was a change in judgment related to the utilization of deferred tax assets in future years. The Company concluded that as of September 27, 2024, the valuation allowance for the Company s deferred tax assets was appropriate in accordance with ASC 740. Consequently, there was change to the valuation allowance during the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024. For acquired business entities, if the Company identifies changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment, and the Company records the offset to goodwill. The Company records all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, and the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023, the Company did t record a liability for uncertain tax positions.

During the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, the difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to state taxes, nondeductible executive compensation, deductions related to stock option exercises, research and development tax credits, and the energy-efficiency building deduction. During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023, the difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to state taxes, non-deductible stock compensation, nondeductible executive compensation, research and development tax credits, and the energy-efficiency building deduction.

G A expenses consisted of an increase of 2.0 million in the Energy segment combined with an increase of 0.8 million in the Engineering and Consulting segment, and an increase of 0.5 million in unallocated corporate expenses. Within G A expenses, the increase of 2.1 million in salaries and wages, payroll taxes and employee benefits, combined with the increase of 0.9 million in other general and administrative expenses, and the increase of 0.8 million in stock-based compensation was partially offset by a decrease of 0.5 million in depreciation and amortization. The increase in salaries and wages, payroll taxes and employee benefits was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation, consistent with the improvement in operating profit, and higher fringe benefit costs. The increase in other general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased professional service fees and computer-related expenses. The increase in stock-based compensation expenses was primarily related to new stock grants to current employees and executives. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to lower amortization of intangible assets from prior acquisitions. Income (loss) from operations. Operating income increased to 8.7 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024, compared to an operating income of 3.8 million for the three months ended September 29, 2023 , as a result of the factors noted above. Total other expense, net. Total other expense, net, decreased 0.4 million, or 24.8 , for the three months ended September 27, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 29, 2023, primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from the reduced interest rate spread derived from lower debt leverage levels under our credit facilities. Income tax expense (benefit). We recorded an income tax expense of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024, an effective tax rate of 2.1 on income before income tax expense, compared to an income tax expense of 0.7 million for the three months ended September 29, 2023, an effective tax rate of 31.3 on income before tax expense. The reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from increases in discrete items related to stock compensation deductions and additional energy-efficiency building deductions.

 Net income (loss). Our net income was 7.3 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to a net income of 1.6 million for the three months ended September 29, 2023. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the increase in income from operations combined with the decrease in total other expense, net and the lower effective tax rate. Nine Months Ended September 27, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 29, 2023 Contract revenue. Consolidated contract revenue increased 67.3 million, or 19.0 , in the nine months ended September 27, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2023, due to incremental revenues in both our Energy segment and our Engineering and Consulting segment. Contract revenue in our Energy segment increased 60.3 million, or 20.6 , in the nine months ended September 27, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2023, primarily as a result of higher construction management revenues and increased demand for energy and electrification services under utility programs. Contract revenue in our Engineering and Consulting segment increased 7.0 million, or 11.3 , in the nine months ended September 27, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2023, primarily due to increased demand for services provided to our clients. Direct costs of contract revenue. Direct costs of consolidated contract revenue increased 44.8 million, or 19.6 , for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2023, primarily as a result of the increase, and change of mix, in contract revenues as described above. As a percentage of contract revenue, direct salaries and wages decreased to 16.4 in the nine months ended September 27, 2024 from 17.9 in the nine months ended September 29, 2023, while subcontractor services and other direct costs increased to 48.5 in the nine months ended September 27, 2024 from 46.7 in the nine months ended September 29, 2023. Direct costs of contract revenue in our Energy segment increased 42.9 million, or 21.5 , for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2023. Direct costs of contract revenue for the Engineering and Consulting segment increased 1.9 million, or 6.5 , in the nine months ended September 27, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2023. Subcontractor services and other direct costs increased by 39.2 million, or 23.7 , in the nine months ended September 27, 2024 , compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2023, primarily due to the increase in construction management revenues and utility program revenues, which utilize a higher percentage of material cost and installation subcontracting. S alaries and wages increased by 5.7 million, or 8.9 , in the nine months ended September 27, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2023, primarily as a result of the increases in contract revenue as described above. Gross Profit . Gross profit increased 17.9 to 147.8 million, or 35.1 gross margin, for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, compared to gross profit of 125.3 million, or 35.4 gross margin, for the nine months ended September 29, 2023. The decrease in our gross margin was primarily driven by changes in the mix of revenues as described above. General and administrative expenses. G A expenses increased 12.3 million, or 10.7 , in the nine months ended September 27, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2023. G A expenses consisted of an increase of 7.4 million in the Energy segment combined with an increase of 4.1 million in the Engineering and Consulting segment, and an increase of 0.8 million in unallocated corporate expenses. Within G A expenses, the increase of 9.8 million in salaries and wages, payroll taxes and employee benefits, combined with the increase of 2.7 million in other general and administrative expenses, and the increase of 1.3 million in stock-based compensation was partially offset by a decrease of 1.6 million in depreciation and amortization. The increase in salaries and wages, payroll taxes and employee benefits was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation, consistent with the improvement in operating profit, and higher fringe benefit costs. The increase in other general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased professional service fees and computer-related

 expenses. The increase in stock-based compensation expenses was primarily related to new stock grants to current employees and executives. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to lower amortization of intangible assets from prior acquisitions. Income (loss) from operations. Operating income increased 98.4 to 20.5 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, compared to an operating income of 10.3 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 , as a result of the factors noted above. Total other expense, net. Total other expense, net, decreased 2.0 million, or 34.6 , for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2023, primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from the reduced interest rate spread derived from lower debt leverage levels under our credit facilities, combined with increased interest income related to our higher cash balances. Income tax expense (benefit). We recorded an income tax expense of 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, an effective tax rate of 11.1 on income before income tax expense, compared to an income tax expense of 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, an effective tax rate of 37.2 on income before tax expense. The reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from increases in discrete items related to stock compensation deductions and additional energy-efficiency building deductions. Net income (loss). Our net income was 14.9 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to a net income of 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the increase in income from operations combined with the decrease in total other expense, net and the lower effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Nine Months Ended September 27, September 29, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 38,611 24,112 Investing activities (6,045) (9,115) Financing activities (2,857) (21,595) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 29,709 (6,598) Sources of Cash Our primary sources of liquidity for the next 12 months and beyond are cash generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility . We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operating activities, and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to finance our operating activities for at least the next 12 months. As of September 27, 2024, we had a fully drawn 100 million term loan with 92.5 million outstanding (the Term Loan , and collectively with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities ), and a 50.0 million Revolving Credit Facility with no borrowed amounts and 1.6 million in letters of credit issued, each scheduled to mature on September 29, 2026. In addition, as of September 27, 2024, we had 53.1 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.

Table of Contents 
 As of September 27, 2024, unhedged borrowings under our Credit Facilities, exclusive of the effects of upfront fees, undrawn fees and issuance cost amortization, bore interest at an annual rate of 7.2 . See Part I, Item 1, Note 6, Debt Obligations , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and Part II, Item 8, Note 6, Debt Obligations , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023, for information regarding our indebtedness, including information about borrowings and repayments, principal repayment terms, interest rates, covenants, and other key terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities were 38.6 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of 24.1 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 . Cash flows from operating activities primarily consists of net income, adjusted for non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, plus or minus changes in current operating assets and liabilities. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, resulted primarily from the increase in earnings and lower working capital requirements. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, resulted primarily from the increase in earnings, combined with lower working capital requirements. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities were 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to cash flows used in investing activities of 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023. Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, were primarily due to cash paid for the development of software and the purchase of computers and equipment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows used in financing activities were 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to cash flows used in financing activities of 21.6 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023. Cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 were primarily attributable to the repayments of 5.6 million under our Term Loan, 1.2 million cash used to pay withholding taxes on stock grants, and 1.0 million principal payments on finance leases, partially offset by 2.8 million of proceeds from sales of common stock under employee stock purchase plan and 2.4 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. Cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 were primarily attributable to the disbursement of 10.7 million in restricted cash for utility rebate incentives, payments of 4.0 million for contingent consideration related to prior acquisitions, combined with repayments and borrowings of 111.0 million and 105.0 million, respectively, under our term loan facility and line of credit, which resulted primarily from refinancing our Prior Credit Facility. Under certain utility contracts, we periodically receive cash deposits to be held in trust for the payment of energy incentive rebates to be sent directly to the utility s end-customer on behalf of the utility. We act solely as the utility s agent to distribute these funds to the end-customer and, accordingly, we classify these contractually restricted funds as restricted cash. Because these funds are held in trust for pass through to the utility s customers and have no impact on our working capital or operating cash flows, these cash receipts are presented in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows, Receipt of restricted cash , with the subsequent payments classified as financing cash outflows, Payment of restricted cash. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities. In addition, our policy is not to enter into futures or forward contracts. Finally, we do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries or any interests in, or relationships with, any special-purpose entities that are not included in the consolidated financial statements. We have, however, an administrative services agreement with Genesys in which we provide Genesys with ongoing administrative, 

 40 

Table of Contents 
 operational and other non-professional support services. We manage Genesys and have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Genesys performance, in addition to being obligated to absorb expected losses from Genesys. Accordingly, we are the primary beneficiary of Genesys and consolidate Genesys as a variable interest entity. Short and Long-term Uses of Cash General Our principal uses of cash are to fund operating expenses, support working capital requirements, finance capital expenditures, and pay down outstanding debt. From time to time, we also use cash to help fund business acquisitions. Our cash and cash equivalents are impacted by the timing of when we invoice and are paid by our customers for services rendered and when we pay expenses as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our known contractual obligations as of September 27, 2024: 

Less than More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years 5 Years (in thousands) Debt (1) 91,894 10,137 81,757 Interest payments on debt outstanding (2) 11,821 6,206 5,615 Operating leases 16,102 5,509 7,809 2,108 676 Finance leases 2,628 1,175 1,266 162 25 Total contractual cash obligations 122,445 23,027 96,447 2,270 701

We have assumed no future borrowings or repayments (other than at maturity) for purposes of this table. Our Term Loan is scheduled to mature on September 29, 2026. (2) Borrowings under our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate. Future interest payments on our Credit Facility are estimated using floating rates in effect as of September 27, 2024. Outstanding Indebtedness See Part I, Item 1, Note 6, Debt Obligations , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and Part II, Item 8, Note 6, Debt Obligations , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023, for information regarding our indebtedness, including information about new borrowings and repayments, principal repayment terms, interest rates, covenants, and other key terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Interest Rate Swap From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to moderate our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates underlying our variable rate debt.

 Impact of Inflation Due to the average duration of our projects and our ability to negotiate prices as contracts end and new contracts begin, historically, our operations have not been materially impacted by inflation. While not material to our results of operations and financial condition, we have experienced higher cost of materials and delays in our supply chain for equipment. The prices of finished products from manufacturers are subject to fluctuation and increases. It is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation, tariffs, price escalation, raw material costs, and other factors that impact the cost of finished goods due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required. We are often able to mitigate the impact of future price increases by entering into fixed price purchase orders for materials and equipment, and subcontracts on our projects, as well as, when appropriate, including cost escalation factors into our proposals. Despite our best mitigation efforts, significant price increases in equipment and disruptions to our supply chain could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, inflationary pressures, including expectations of future inflation, may impact the customers of our utility clients, which may lead to delayed or deferred decisions regarding expenditures to improve energy efficiency, and therefore potentially impact our future revenues. Components of Revenue and Expense Contract Revenue We generally provide our services under contracts, purchase orders or retainer letters. The agreements we enter into with our clients typically incorporate one of three principal types of pricing provisions: time-and-materials, unit-based, and fixed price. Revenue on our time-and-materials and unit-based contracts are recognized as the work is performed in accordance with specific terms of the contract. As of September 27, 2024, 18 of our contracts are time-and-materials contracts, 38 are unit-based contracts, and 44 are fixed price contracts, compared to 21 are time-and-materials contracts, 39 are unit-based contracts, and 40 are fixed price contracts, as of September 29, 2023. Some of these contracts include maximum contract prices, but contract maximums are often adjusted to reflect the level of effort to achieve client objectives and thus the majority of these contracts are not expected to exceed the maximum. Contract revenue on our fixed price contracts is determined on the percentage of completion method based generally on the ratio of direct costs incurred to date to estimated total direct costs at completion. Many of our fixed price contracts involve a high degree of subcontracted fixed price effort and are relatively short in duration, thereby lowering the risks of not properly estimating the percent complete. Adjustments to contract cost estimates are made in the periods in which the facts requiring such revisions become known. When the revised estimate indicates a loss, such loss is recognized in the current period in its entirety. Claims and change orders that have not been finalized are evaluated to determine whether or not a change has occurred in the enforceable rights and obligations of the original contract. If these non-finalized changes qualify as a contract modification, a determination is made whether to account for the change in contract value as a modification to the existing contract, or a separate contract and revenue under the claims or change orders is recognized accordingly. Costs related to un-priced change orders are expensed when incurred, and recognition of the related revenue is based on the assessment above of whether or not a contract modification has occurred. Estimated profit for un-priced change orders is recognized only if collection is probable. Our contracts come up for renewal periodically and at the time of renewal may be subject to renegotiation, which could impact the profitability on that contract. In addition, during the term of a contract, public agencies may request additional or revised services which may impact the economics of the transaction. Most of our contracts permit our clients, with prior notice, to terminate the contracts at any time without cause. While we have a large volume of contracts, the renewal, termination or modification of a contract, in particular contracts with Consolidated Edison, the Dormitory Authority-State of New York, the New York City Housing Authority, and utility programs associated with

 Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Duke Energy Corp., may have a material effect on our consolidated operations. Some of our contracts include certain performance guarantees, such as a guaranteed energy saving quantity. Such guarantees are generally measured upon completion of a project. In the event that the measured performance level is less than the guaranteed level, any resulting financial penalty, including any additional work that may be required to fulfill the guarantee, is estimated and charged to direct expenses in the current period. We have not experienced any significant costs under such guarantees. Direct Costs of Contract Revenue Direct costs of contract revenue consist primarily of that portion of salaries and wages that have been incurred in connection with revenue producing projects. Direct costs of contract revenue also include material costs, subcontractor services, equipment and other expenses that are incurred in connection with revenue producing projects. Direct costs of contract revenue exclude that portion of salaries and wages related to marketing efforts, vacations, holidays and other time not spent directly generating revenue under existing contracts. Such costs are included in general and administrative expenses. Additionally, payroll taxes, bonuses and employee benefit costs for all of our personnel are included in general and administrative expenses since no allocation of these costs is made to direct costs of contract revenue. Other companies may classify as direct costs of contract revenue some of the costs that we classify as general and administrative costs. We expense direct costs of contract revenue when incurred. General and Administrative Expenses G A expenses include the costs of the marketing and support staff, other marketing expenses, management and administrative personnel costs, payroll taxes, bonuses and employee benefits for all of our employees and the portion of salaries and wages not allocated to direct costs of contract revenue for those employees who provide our services. G A expenses also include facility costs, depreciation and amortization, professional services, legal and accounting fees and administrative operating costs. Within G A expenses, Other includes expenses such as professional services, legal and accounting, computer costs, travel and entertainment, marketing costs and acquisition costs. We expense general and administrative costs when incurred. Critical Accounting Policies We have prepared the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. GAAP ). To prepare these financial statements in conformity with GAAP, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2023. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023 for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.

 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes. Market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments, including long-term debt. As of September 27, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 53.1 million. This amount represents cash on hand in business checking accounts with BMO Bank, N.A. We do not engage in trading activities and do not participate in foreign currency transactions. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our Term Loan and borrowings, if any, under our Revolving Credit Facility, each of which bears interest at variable rates. As of September 27, 2024, 92.5 million was outstanding under our Term Loan, and we had no borrowed amounts outstanding and 1.6 million in letters of credit were issued under our Revolving Credit Facility. Each of our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility mature on September 29, 2026 and are governed by our Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, (as described in Part II, Item 8, Note 6, Debt Obligations , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023), borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either a Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or the adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), at the Company s option, and in each case, plus an applicable margin, which applicable margin ranges from 0.75 to 2.00 with respect to Base Rate borrowings and 1.75 to 3.00 with respect to SOFR borrowings, depending on the Company s Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement); provided, that SOFR and the Base Rate cannot be less than 0.00 , with the specific pricing reset on each date on which the Administrative Agent receives the required financial statements under the Credit Agreement for the fiscal quarter then ended. The Company must also pay a commitment fee for the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which ranges from 0.20 to 0.40 per annum depending on the Company s Total Net Leverage Ratio, and fees on the face amount of any letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, which range from 1.3125 to 2.25 per annum, in each case, depending on the Company s Total Net Leverage Ratio, as well as customary fronting fees payable to BMO as letter of credit issuer. The Term Loan will amortize quarterly in an amount equal to (i) 7.5 per annum for the first year ending after the Closing Date and (ii) 10.0 per annum for the second and third years ending after the Closing Date, with a final payment of all then remaining principal and interest due on the maturity date of September 29, 2026. The amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty (other than customary breakage costs). On November 30, 2023, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for 50.0 million notional amount. The interest swap agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge to fix the variable interest rate on a portion of the outstanding principal amount under our Term Loan. The interest rate swap fixed rate is 4.77 and expires on September 29, 2026. Based upon the amount of our outstanding indebtedness as of September 27, 2024, a one percentage point increase in the effective interest rate, inclusive of our interest rate swap agreement, would change our annual interest expense by approximately 1.1 million in fiscal year 2024.

 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15-d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael A. Bieber, and our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President , Creighton K. Early, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 27, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at a reasonable assurance level, as of September 27, 2024. No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings We are subject to claims and lawsuits from time to time, including those alleging professional errors or omissions that arise in the ordinary course of business against firms that operate in the engineering and consulting professions. We carry professional liability insurance, subject to certain deductibles and policy limits, for such claims as they arise and may from time to time establish reserves for litigation that is considered probable of a loss. In accordance with accounting standards regarding loss contingencies, we accrue an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and an estimate of any reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements not to be misleading. We do not accrue liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. Because litigation outcomes are inherently unpredictable, our evaluation of legal proceedings often involves a series of complex assessments by management about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. If the assessments indicate that loss contingencies that could be material to any one of our financial statements are not probable, but are reasonably possible, or are probable, but cannot be estimated, then we disclose the nature of the loss contingencies, together with an estimate of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable. While the consequences of certain unresolved proceedings are not presently determinable, and a reasonable estimate of the probable and reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for such proceedings cannot be made, an adverse outcome from such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in any given reporting period. However, in the opinion of our management, after consulting with legal counsel, and taking into account insurance coverage, the ultimate liability related to current outstanding claims and lawsuits is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors There are no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2023. ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds During the fiscal quarter ended September 27, 2024, we made the following repurchases of shares of our common stock from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations incurred in connection with the vesting of restricted stock: Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Number (or Approximate Dollar Value) of Shares That May Yet be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs June 29, 2024 July 26, 2024 July 27, 2024 August 23, 2024 12,204 37.36 August 24, 2024 September 27, 2024 TOTAL 12,204 37.36
