 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants for its revolving credit agreement and its weighted-average private placement senior notes (the private placement senior notes ). 
 Revolving Credit Agreement 
 
 On September 12, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment relating to its revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent ), and certain lenders and issuing banks party thereto (as amended by the Amendment, and further amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement ). The Amendment has increased the aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement from billion to billion, extended the Credit Agreement maturity date from March 10, 2028 to September 12, 2029, made certain amendments to the representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, and made certain other modifications. The Company incurred million of debt issuance costs related to the Amendment which were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the amended Credit Agreement. 
 
 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company s option, either a term secured overnight financing rate SOFR plus a percent credit spread adjustment for all tenors or a base rate, plus, in each case, an interest rate margin which ranges from to basis points for base rate loans and to basis points for term SOFR loans, based on the Company s credit rating. The commitment fee on the unused available credit is calculated at annual rates ranging from basis points to basis points, based on the Company s credit rating. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement can be extended for additional periods on up to two occasions upon the agreement of the Company and lenders holding at least percent of the commitments under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, including the maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio of no more than to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter until such time as the Company has no other debt in a principal amount in excess of million outstanding that has a financial maintenance covenant based on a leverage ratio, at which time the Credit Agreement requires maintenance of a ratio of total net debt to capitalization of no more than percent (with all calculations based on definitions contained in the Credit Agreement).

 Derivative instruments Liabilities Deferred compensation plan Derivative instruments 
 The Company s investments associated with its deferred compensation plans consist of mutual funds that are publicly traded and for which market prices are readily available. 
 The derivative instruments were measured based on quotes from the Company s counterparties. Such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs, including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward commodity prices, basis differentials, volatility factors and interest rates for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable. Estimates are derived from, or verified using, relevant NYMEX futures contracts, are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties and third-party valuation services, or a combination of the foregoing. The determination of the fair values presented above also incorporates a credit adjustment for non-performance risk. The Company measured the non-performance risk of its counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions with which it has derivative contracts while non-performance risk of the Company is evaluated using credit default swap spreads for various similarly rated companies in the same sector as the Company. The Company has not incurred any losses related to non-performance risk of its counterparties and does not anticipate any material impact on its financial results due to non-performance by third parties. 
 The most significant unobservable inputs relative to the Company s Level 3 derivative contracts are basis differentials, discount rates and volatility factors. An increase (decrease) in these unobservable inputs would result in an increase (decrease) in fair value, respectively. The Company does not have access to the specific assumptions used in its counterparties or third-party valuation service provider s valuation models. Consequently, additional disclosures regarding significant Level 3 unobservable inputs were not provided. 
 Total gain (loss) included in earnings Settlement (gain) loss ) ) Transfers in and/or out of Level 3 Balance at end of period Change in unrealized gains (losses) relating to assets and liabilities still held at the end of the period 
 Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities 
 The Company discloses or recognizes its non-financial assets and liabilities, such as impairments of oil and gas properties or acquisitions, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. As of the Company s other non-financial assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of September 30, 2024, additional disclosures were not required. 
 The estimated fair value of the Company s asset retirement obligations at inception is determined by utilizing the income approach by applying a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, which considers the Company s credit risk, the time value of money, and the current economic state to the undiscounted expected abandonment cash flows. Given the unobservable nature of the inputs, the measurement of the asset retirement obligations was classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

 Restricted Stock Units - Employees 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted restricted stock units to employees of the Company with a weighted average grant date value of per unit. The fair value of restricted stock unit grants is based on the closing stock price on the grant date. Restricted stock units generally vest at the end of a service period.

 Performance Share Awards 
 Total Shareholder Return TSR Performance Share Awards . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted TSR Performance Share Awards, which are earned or not earned, based on the comparative performance of the Company s common stock measured against a predetermined group of companies in the Company s peer group and certain industry-related indices over a performance period, which commenced on February 1, 2024 and ends on January 31, 2027. 
 These awards have both an equity and liability component, with the right to receive up to the first percent of the award in shares of common stock and the right to receive up to an additional percent of the value of the award in excess of the equity component in cash. These awards also include a feature that will reduce the potential cash component of the award if the actual performance is negative over the period and the base calculation indicates an above-target payout. The equity portion of these awards is valued on the grant date and is not marked-to-market, while the liability portion of the awards is valued as of the end of each reporting period on a mark-to-market basis. The Company calculates the fair value of the equity and liability portions of the awards using a Monte Carlo simulation model. 
 The Company assumed a percent annual forfeiture rate for purposes of recognizing stock-based compensation expense for these awards based on the Company s actual forfeiture history and expectations for this type of award.

 Repurchased 15 million shares for 404 million. 
 Market Conditions and Commodity Prices 
 Our financial results depend on many factors, particularly commodity prices and our ability to find, develop and market our production on economically attractive terms. Commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which can be impacted by pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials, weather conditions, and geopolitical, economic and other factors. 
 Oil prices have recovered in recent years from previous pandemic-related market weakness, particularly on the demand side. Global conflict and supply chain disruptions drove high oil prices in 2022, which then moderated throughout 2023. OPEC+ reacted with supply reductions, helping to stabilize oil price levels during 2023. U.S. oil production has been flat, which, when combined with OPEC+ s reductions, has contributed to relatively steadier oil prices in 2023 and 2024. 
 Natural gas prices have trended down year-over-year as strong production and relatively weak demand drove inventory levels above the five-year average. While natural gas prices have increased from their lows in early 2024, natural gas prices in 2024 have still trended lower overall compared to 2023. In response to the weakness of natural gas prices, we strategically curtailed our production in the Marcellus Shale during 2024, resulting in an estimated curtailment of 275 MMcf per day of gross production. Natural gas prices are expected to experience a slight increase throughout the remainder of 2024 and into early 2025 due to, among other factors, forecasted colder temperatures resulting in increased seasonal demand. Meanwhile, basis differentials have become more divergent in 2024, in part due to constrained pipeline capacity and oversupply in certain geographic areas, and at times have resulted in negative spot market pricing this year for natural gas, such as in the Permian Basin at the Waha Hub. Looking towards 2025, recent NYMEX strip pricing indicates the forecasted increase in natural gas prices overall is expected to continue, partially as a result of, among other factors, an expected increase in demand driven by LNG exports. 
 Although the current outlook on oil and natural gas prices is generally favorable and our operations have not been significantly impacted in the short-term, in the event further disruptions occur and continue for an extended period of time, our operations could be adversely impacted, commodity prices could decline, and our costs could increase. We expect commodity price volatility to continue, driven by further geopolitical disruptions, including conflicts in the Middle East and actions of OPEC+ and potentially swift near- and medium-term fluctuations in supply and demand. While we are unable to predict future commodity prices, at current oil, natural gas and NGL price levels, we do not believe that an impairment of our oil and gas properties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future. However, in the event that commodity prices significantly decline or costs significantly increase from current levels, our management would evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties. 
 In addition, the issue of, and increasing political and social attention on, climate change has resulted in both existing and pending national, regional and local legislation and regulatory measures, such as mandates for renewable energy and emissions reductions. Changes in these laws or regulations may result in delays or restrictions in permitting and the development of projects, may result in increased costs and may impair our ability to move forward with our construction, completions, drilling,

 water management, waste handling, storage, transport and remediation activities, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. 
 For information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our revenues, refer to Results of Operations below. 
 Outlook 
 Our 2024 full year capital program is expected to be approximately 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with our operating cash flow. We expect to turn-in-line 141 to 157 total net wells in 2024 across our three operating regions. Approximately 64 percent of our drilling and completion capital is expected to be invested in the Permian Basin, 18 percent in the Marcellus Shale and 18 percent in the Anadarko Basin. 
 In 2023, we drilled 264 gross wells (169.4 net) and turned-in-line 273 gross wells (173.0 net). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our capital program focused on the Permian Basin, Marcellus Shale and Anadarko Basin, where we drilled 120.9 net wells and turned in line 118.3 net wells. Our capital program for the remainder of 2024 will focus on execution of our 2024 plan presented in our annual guidance. In the normal course of our business, we will continue to assess the oil and natural gas price macro environments and may adjust our capital allocation accordingly. 
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We strive to maintain an adequate liquidity level to address commodity price volatility and risk. Our liquidity requirements consist primarily of our planned capital expenditures, payment of contractual obligations (including debt maturities and interest payments), working capital requirements, dividend payments and share repurchases. Although we have no obligation to do so, we may also from time-to-time refinance or retire our outstanding debt through privately negotiated transactions, open market repurchases, redemptions, exchanges, tender offers or otherwise. 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement. Our liquidity requirements are generally funded with cash flows provided by operating activities, together with cash on hand. However, from time-to-time, our investments may be funded by bank borrowings (including draws on our revolving credit agreement), sales of assets, and private or public financing based on our monitoring of capital markets and our balance sheet. While there are no rating triggers in any of our debt agreements that would accelerate the scheduled maturities if our debt rating falls below a certain level, a change in our debt rating could adversely impact our interest rate on any borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and our ability to economically access debt markets and could trigger the requirement to post credit support under various agreements, which could reduce the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement. As of the date hereof, our debt is currently rated as investment grade by the three leading ratings agencies. For more on the impact of credit ratings on our interest rates and fees for unused commitments under our revolving credit agreement, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Form 10-K, Long-Term Debt and Credit Agreements. We believe that, with operating cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit agreement, we have the ability to finance our spending plans over the next 12 months and, based on current expectations, for the longer term. 
 Our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit agreement, borrowings and repayments of debt, the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable, respectively, payment of dividends, repurchases of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity. From time-to-time, our working capital will reflect a deficit, while at other times it will reflect a surplus. This fluctuation is not unusual. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a working capital surplus of 655 million and 355 million, respectively. We believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit agreement as outlined above to meet our working capital requirements over the next 12 months. 
 In September 2024, we entered into an amendment relating to our revolving credit agreement, which increased our aggregate commitments from 1.5 billion to 2.0 billion and extended the maturity date to September 2029, among other things. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement, our unused commitments were 2.0 billion, and we had unrestricted cash on hand of 843 million. 
 In March 2024, we issued 500 million of 5.60 senior notes, and used these net proceeds, along with cash on hand, to fund the repayment of the 575 million of 3.65 weighted-average senior notes that matured in September 2024.

 Our revolving credit agreement includes a covenant limiting our borrowing capacity based on our leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants applicable to our revolving credit agreement and private placement senior notes. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, Long-Term Debt and Credit Agreements and Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Form 10-K, Long-Term Debt and Credit Agreements, for further details. 
 Cash Flows 
 Our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2024 2023 Cash flows provided by operating activities 2,169 2,898 Cash flows used in investing activities (1,327) (1,589) Cash flows used in financing activities (959) (1,136) Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (117) 173 
 Operating Activities. Operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by changes in commodity prices, production volumes and operating expenses. As stated above, commodity prices have historically been volatile. Fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 729 million compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in natural gas revenue, caused by lower natural gas prices and production, an increase in operating costs, a decrease in cash received on derivative settlements and a net reduction in working capital during 2024. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in oil revenues. 
 Refer to Results of Operations below for additional information relative to commodity prices, production and operating expense fluctuations. We are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities. 
 Investing Activities . Cash flows used in investing activities decreased by 262 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to 294 million lower cash paid for capital expenditures, partially offset by 32 million lower proceeds from asset sales. 
 Financing Activities . Cash flows used in financing activities decreased by 177 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to the issuance of the 500 million of 5.60 senior notes during the first quarter of 2024 and 269 million of lower dividend payments. These decreases were partially offset by the repayment of 575 million of 3.65 weighted-average senior notes at their maturity in September 2024 and 16 million of increased common stock repurchases. The lower dividend payments were a result of a decrease in our dividend rate from 0.97 per common share (base-plus-variable) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.63 per common share (base only) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a decrease in outstanding shares of common stock due to our active share repurchase program during 2023 and the first nine months of 2024.

 Capital and Exploration Expenditures 
 On an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital expenditures, excluding any significant property acquisitions, with cash flow provided by operating activities, and, if required, borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. We budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year. 
 The following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures:

 ________________________________________________________ 
 (1) Exploration expenditures include 5 million of exploratory dry hole costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no exploratory dry hole costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our capital program focused on the Permian Basin, Marcellus Shale and Anadarko Basin, where we drilled 120.9 net wells and turned-in-line 118.3 net wells. We continue to expect that our full-year 2024 capital program will be approximately 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion. Refer to Outlook above for additional information regarding the current year drilling program. We will continue to assess the commodity price environment and may adjust our capital expenditures accordingly. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations.

 Gain on Derivative Instruments 
 Net gains and losses on our derivative instruments are a function of fluctuations in the underlying commodity index prices as compared to the contracted prices and the monthly cash settlements (if any) of the derivative instruments. We have elected not to designate our derivatives as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and, therefore, we do not apply hedge accounting treatment to our derivative instruments. Consequently, changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments and cash settlements are included as a component of operating revenues as either a net gain or loss on derivative instruments. Cash settlements of our contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in our statement of cash flows. 
 The following table presents the components of Gain on derivative instruments for the periods indicated:

 Operating Costs and Expenses 
 Costs associated with producing oil and natural gas are substantial. Among other factors, some of these costs vary with commodity prices, some trend with the volume and commodity mix, some are a function of the number of wells we own and operate, some depend on the prices charged by service companies, and some fluctuate based on a combination of the foregoing. Our costs for services, labor and supplies had begun to stabilize at the end of 2023 despite the on-going demand for those items and the latent effects of inflation and supply chain disruptions, and thus far in 2024 these costs have remained stable.

Table of Contents 

 The following table reflects our operating costs and expenses for the periods indicated and a discussion of the operating costs and expenses follows. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Variance Per BOE (In millions, except per BOE) 2024 2023 Amount Percent 2024 2023 Operating Expenses Direct operations 165 137 28 20 2.69 2.22 Gathering, processing and transportation 245 235 10 4 3.97 3.81 Taxes other than income 66 62 4 6 1.08 1.00 Exploration 9 5 4 80 0.15 0.08 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 475 421 54 13 7.73 6.82 General and administrative 75 79 (4) (5) 1.24 1.29 1,035 939 96 10 
 Direct Operations 
 Direct operations generally consist of costs for labor, equipment, maintenance, saltwater disposal, compression, power, treating and miscellaneous other costs (collectively, lease operating expense ). Direct operations also include well workover activity necessary to maintain production from existing wells. 
 Direct operations expense consisted of lease operating expense and workover expense as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Per BOE (In millions, except per BOE) 2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Direct Operations Expense Lease operating expense 138 115 23 2.25 1.86 Workover expense 27 22 5 0.44 0.36 165 137 28 2.69 2.22 
 Lease operating expense increased primarily due to higher operating costs driven by our production mix related to increased production in fields with higher operating costs and higher equipment and field service costs. 
 Gathering, Processing and Transportation 
 Gathering, processing and transportation costs principally consist of expenditures to prepare and transport production downstream from the wellhead, including gathering, fuel, and compression, along with processing costs, which are incurred to extract NGLs from the raw natural gas stream. Gathering costs also include costs associated with operating our gas gathering infrastructure, including operating and maintenance expenses. Costs vary by operating area and will fluctuate with increases or decreases in production volumes, contractual fees, and changes in fuel and compression costs. 
 Gathering, processing and transportation costs increased 10 million primarily due to higher gathering and transportation costs in the Permian Basin related to higher transportation rates and higher production, partially offset by lower gathering charges in the Marcellus Shale related to lower production.

 Taxes Other Than Income 
 Taxes other than income consist of production (or severance) taxes, drilling impact fees, ad valorem taxes and other taxes. State and local taxing authorities assess these taxes, with production taxes being based on the volume or value of production, drilling impact fees being based on drilling activities and prevailing natural gas prices and ad valorem taxes being based on the value of properties. 
 The following table presents taxes other than income for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2024 2023 Variance Taxes Other than Income Production 53 45 8 Drilling impact fees 4 5 (1) Ad valorem 9 11 (2) Other 1 (1) 66 62 4 Production taxes as percentage of revenue (Permian and Anadarko Basins) 
 5.5 4.7 
 Taxes other than income increased primarily due to an increase in our production taxes primarily due to higher oil and NGL revenues in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Exploration 
 Exploration expense increased primarily due to 5 million of exploratory dry hole costs recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization DD A 
 DD A expense consisted of the following for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Per BOE (In millions, except per BOE) 2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 DD A Expense Depletion 443 387 56 7.19 6.27 Depreciation 18 19 (1) 0.32 0.31 Amortization of unproved properties 12 12 0.19 0.19 Accretion of ARO 2 3 (1) 0.03 0.05 475 421 54 7.73 6.82 
 Depletion of our producing properties is computed on a field basis using the units-of-production method under the successful efforts method of accounting. The economic life of each producing property depends upon the estimated proved reserves for that property, which in turn depend upon the assumed realized sales price for future production. Therefore, fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices will impact the level of proved developed and proved reserves used in the calculation. Higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves, which reduces depletion expense. Conversely, lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves, which increases depletion expense. The cost of replacing production also impacts our depletion expense. In addition, changes in estimates of reserve quantities, estimates of operating and future development costs, reclassifications of properties from unproved to proved and impairments of oil and gas properties will also impact depletion expense. Our depletion expense increased 56 million primarily due to a higher depletion rate which was driven by lower oil and gas reserve volumes and a shift in our production mix which resulted in increased production from fields with higher depletion rates. The lower oil and gas reserve volumes were driven by negative price revisions as a result of lower prices in 2023. 
 Fixed assets consist primarily of gas gathering facilities, water infrastructure, buildings, vehicles, aircraft, furniture and fixtures and computer equipment and software. These items are recorded at cost and are depreciated on the straight-line method

 based on expected lives of the individual assets, which range from three to 30 years. Also included in our depreciation expense is the depreciation of the right-of-use asset associated with our finance lease gathering system. 
 Unproved properties are amortized based on our drilling experience and our expectation of converting our unproved leaseholds to proved properties. The rate of amortization depends on the timing and success of our exploration and development program. If development of unproved properties is deemed unsuccessful and the properties are abandoned or surrendered, the capitalized costs are expensed in the period the determination is made. 
 General and Administrative G A 
 G A expense consists primarily of salaries and related benefits, stock-based compensation, office rent, legal and consulting fees, systems costs and other administrative costs incurred. 
 The table below reflects our G A expense for the periods indicated:

 Stock-based compensation expense will fluctuate based on the grant date fair value of awards, the number of awards, the requisite service period of the awards, estimated employee forfeitures, and the timing of the awards. Stock-based compensation expense decreased 7 million primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of performance share awards in 2024 compared to 2023.

 Interest expense increased primarily due to higher debt balances during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income increased 6 million due to higher interest earned on our higher cash and short-term investment balances.

 32 

Table of Contents 

 Lease operating expense increased primarily due to higher production levels and higher operating costs driven by our production mix related to increased production in fields with higher operating costs and higher equipment and field service costs. 
 Gathering, Processing and Transportation 
 Gathering, processing and transportation costs increased 8 million due to higher production in the Permian and Anadarko Basins, partially offset lower production in the Marcellus Shale and lower transportation rates in the Permian and Anadarko Basins. 
 Taxes Other Than Income 
 The following table presents taxes other than income for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2024 2023 Variance Taxes Other than Income Production 159 148 11 Drilling impact fees 11 18 (7) Ad valorem 25 43 (18) Other (1) 2 (3) 194 211 (17) Production taxes as percentage of revenue (Permian and Anadarko Basins) 5.6 5.5 
 Taxes other than income decreased 17 million primarily due to lower ad valorem taxes, which was primarily driven by a combination of lower expected property valuations in 2024 resulting in a lower tax obligation and a reduction of prior period accruals due to a change in estimated taxes due for the full-year 2023. Additionally, drilling impact fees decreased primarily due to a decrease in activity in the Marcellus Shale and lower natural gas prices. These decreases were partially offset by a slight increase in our production taxes, which increased primarily due to higher oil and NGL production compared to 2023. 
 Exploration 
 Exploration expense increased primarily due to 5 million of exploratory dry hole costs recognized in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization DD A 
 DD A expense consisted of the following for the periods indicated: Nine Months Ended September 30, Per BOE (In millions, except per Boe) 2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 DD A Expense Depletion 1,256 1,086 170 6.79 6.06 Depreciation 54 55 (1) 0.30 0.31 Amortization of unproved properties 36 36 0.19 0.20 Accretion of ARO 8 8 0.04 0.04 1,354 1,185 169 7.32 6.61 
 Our depletion expense increased 170 million primarily due to an increase in our depletion rate and an increase in production. Our depletion rate increased due to lower oil and gas reserve volumes and a shift in our production mix which resulted in increased production from fields with higher depletion rates. The lower oil and gas reserve volumes were driven by negative price revisions as a result of lower prices in 2023.

 G A expense, excluding stock-based compensation and merger-related expenses, increased 16 million primarily due to the recognition of certain long-term commitments for community outreach and charitable contributions in 2024 and higher employee related costs in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Stock-based compensation expense decreased 1 million primarily due to the impact of the liquidation of our common stock from our deferred compensation plan that resulted in a 7 million gain that decreased stock-based compensation expense in the first half of 2023, partially offset by awards that vested in 2023 and a decrease in the valuation of performance share awards in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Merger-related expense decreased 10 million as the employee-related severance and termination benefits associated with the 2021 merger was accrued over the transition period during 2022 and 2023.

 Interest expense increased 27 million primarily due to an increase of 15 million related to interest on debt balances, primarily due to the issuance of 5.60 senior notes in early March 2024 and an increase in other interest expense of 13 million related to assessments arising due to the timing of certain regulatory filings. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income increased 19 million due to higher interest earned on our higher cash and short-term investment balances.

 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 In the normal course of business, we are subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with changes in commodity prices and interest rate movements on outstanding debt. Except as otherwise indicated, the following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments to which we were party as of September 30, 2024 and from which we may incur future gains or losses from changes in commodity prices or interest rates. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Our most significant market risk exposure is pricing applicable to our oil, natural gas and NGL production. Realized prices are mainly driven by the worldwide price for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas and NGL production. As noted above, these prices have been volatile and unpredictable. To mitigate the volatility in commodity prices, we may enter into derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our production. 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 Derivative Instruments and Risk Management Activities 
 Our commodity price risk management strategy is designed to reduce the risk of commodity price volatility for our production in the oil and natural gas markets through the use of financial commodity derivatives. A committee that consists of members of senior management oversees these risk management activities. Our financial commodity derivatives generally cover a portion of our production and, while protecting us in the event of price declines, limit the benefit to us in the event of price increases. Further, if any of our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the full benefit of our financial commodity derivatives. Please read the discussion below as well as Note 4 in this Form 10-Q and Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of our derivatives. 
 Periodically, we enter into financial commodity derivatives, including collar, swap and basis swap agreements, to protect against exposure to commodity price declines. All of our financial derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes. Under the collar agreements, if the index price rises above the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty. If the index price falls below the floor price, the counterparty pays us. Under the swap agreements, we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market-based index.

 A significant portion of our expected oil and natural gas production for the remainder of 2024 and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in oil and natural gas prices, whether favorable or unfavorable. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, oil collars with floor prices ranging from 65.00 to 70.00 per Bbl and ceiling prices ranging from 80.55 to 92.40 per Bbl covered 9.6 MMBbls, or 33 percent, of our oil production at a weighted-average price of 66.71 per Bbl. Oil basis swaps covered 10.9 MMBbls, or 37 percent, of our oil production at a weighted-average price of 1.14 per Bbl. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 2.50 to 3.00 per MMBtu and ceiling prices ranging from 2.85 to 5.67 per MMBtu covered 122.5 Mcf, or 16 percent of our natural gas production at a weighted-average price of 2.80 per MMBtu.

Table of Contents 

 We are exposed to market risk on financial commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of the related commodity. However, the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain on or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity. Although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of oil and natural gas agreements, the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of non-performance by third parties are substantially smaller. Our counterparties are primarily commercial banks and financial service institutions that our management believes present minimal credit risk, and our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. We perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable. We have not incurred any losses related to non-performance risk of our counterparties, and we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to non-performance by third parties. However, we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total debt of 2,066 million (with a principal amount of 2,000 million). All of our outstanding debt is based on fixed interest rates and, as a result, we do not have significant exposure to movements in market interest rates with respect to such debt. Our revolving credit agreement provides for variable interest rate borrowings; however, we did not have any borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and, therefore, we have no related exposure to interest rate risk. 
 Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 
 The estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties. The carrying amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
 The fair value of our senior notes is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our private placement senior notes is based on third-party quotes which are derived from credit spreads for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate and other unobservable inputs. 
 The carrying amount and estimated fair value of debt are as follows: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In millions) Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Total debt 2,066 1,989 2,161 2,015 Current maturities (575) (565) Long-term debt, excluding current maturities 2,066 1,989 1,586 1,450 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, of information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act. 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Legal Matters 
 The information set forth under the heading Legal Matters in Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q is incorporated by reference in response to this item. 
 Governmental Proceedings 
 From time-to-time, we receive notices of violation from governmental and regulatory authorities, including notices relating to alleged violations of environmental statutes or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. While we cannot predict with certainty whether these notices of violation will result in fines, penalties or both, if fines or penalties are imposed, they may result in monetary sanctions, individually or in the aggregate, in excess of 300,000. 
 In June 2023, we received a Notice of Violation and Opportunity to Confer NOVOC from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA alleging violations of the Clean Air Act, the Texas State Implementation Plan, the New Mexico State Implementation Plan NMSIP and certain other state and federal regulations pertaining to Company facilities in Texas and New Mexico. Separately, in July 2023, we received a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice that the EPA has referred this NOVOC for civil enforcement proceedings. In August 2023, we received a second NOVOC from the EPA alleging violations of the Clean Air Act, the NMSIP, and certain other state and federal regulations pertaining to Company facilities in New Mexico. We have exchanged information with the EPA and continue to engage in discussions aimed at resolving the allegations. At this time we are unable to predict with certainty the financial impact of these NOVOCs or the timing of any resolution. However, any enforcement action related to these NOVOCs will likely result in fines or penalties, or both, and corrective actions, which may increase our development costs or operating costs. We believe that any fines, penalties, or corrective actions that may result from these matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
