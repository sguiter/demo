SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"), about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding the filing of, eventual stockholder approval of, our ability to implement, and impact or benefits of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case (as defined below), our ability to continue as a going concern, general economic and market conditions, our future results of operations and financial condition, business strategy, and plans and objectives of management for future operations, including the impact of the Value Maximization Plan and Ecommerce Wind-Down, the ongoing activities of and potential growth of our UACC and CarStory businesses, our Long-Term Strategic Plan, our ability to maintain compliance with the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq ), the amendment and renewal of the Warehouse Credit Facilities (as defined herein), and the retention of key employees, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as "anticipate," "believe," "contemplate," "continue," "could," "design," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "potentially," "predict," "project," "should," " target," "will," " would," or the negative of these terms or other similar terms or expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. 
 The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions. Forward-looking statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including: 
 we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case; 

we may not be able to obtain confirmation of the prepackaged plan of reorganization (the Plan") as outlined in the Restructuring Support Agreement RSA"); 

if the RSA is terminated, our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan could be materially and adversely affected; 

the RSA is subject to significant conditions and milestones that may be difficult for us to satisfy; 

trading in our securities is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. If the Plan becomes effective, the holders of our existing common stock will be diluted; 

following the effectiveness of the Plan, certain holders of Unsecured Notes Claims (as defined herein), if they choose to act together, will have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders of the reorganized company for approval; 

our business could suffer from a long and protracted restructuring; 

as a result of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, our historical financial information will not be indicative of our future performance; 

we are subject to claims that will not be discharged in the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; 

the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case has consumed and is expected to continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition; 

upon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our Board of Directors may change; 

the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case raises substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern; 

our indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our debt obligations; 

we may be unable to satisfy a continued listing rule from Nasdaq, and if we are delisted, we may not be able to satisfy an initial listing rule from Nasdaq or another national securities exchange;

Table of Contents 

our tax attributes and future tax deductions may be reduced or significantly limited as a result of the consummation of the Plan and any restructuring or reorganization in connection therewith; 

there are risks associated with the discontinuance of our ecommerce operations and wind-down of our used vehicle dealership business; 

we may not generate sufficient liquidity to operate our business; 

our Value Maximization Plan may not be successful, and may not lead to growth and enhanced profitability for our UACC or CarStory businesses; 

UACC may be unable to continue to access or renew funding sources and obtain capital needed to maintain and grow its business; 

our business may be adversely affected by general business and economic conditions and risks related to the larger automotive ecosystem, including consumer demand; 

we have a history of losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future; 

we depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, integrate, adequately compensate, and attract qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed; 

the geographic concentration of UACC's borrowers or dealerships creates an exposure to local and regional downturns or severe weather or catastrophic occurrences that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; 

UACC may be unable to sell automotive finance receivables and generate gains on sales of those finance receivables, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition; 

UACC's securitizations may expose it to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require it to seek more costly financing; 

UACC is currently experiencing increasing credit losses in interests it holds in automotive finance receivables and its credit scoring systems may not effectively forecast its automotive receivables loss rates. Higher than anticipated credit losses or prepayments or the inability to effectively forecast loss rates may negatively impact our operating results; 

if UACC loses servicing rights on its automobile contracts, our results of operations would be negatively impacted; 

we are, and may in the future be, subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. If the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; and 

the risks described in the section titled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include additional factors that could harm our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements. 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this report or to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference or incorporate by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have filed as exhibits to this report with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance, and achievements may be materially different from what we expect.

The Company did t have any finance receivables held for sale at fair value as of December 31, 2023. The Company reassesses the estimate for fair value at each reporting period with any changes reflected as a fair value adjustment and recorded in "Realized and unrealized losses, net of recoveries" in the consolidated statements of operations. For all finance receivables at fair value, the Company recognizes the fees it charges to dealers upon acquisition as other income at the time of issuance of the finance receivable and recognizes the acquisition costs to underwrite the finance receivables as an expense in the period incurred. For finance receivables held for sale at fair value, any discounts are deferred until the finance receivables are sold. For finance receivables held for investment at fair value, any discounts are amortized over the contractual life of the underlying finance receivables.

 million and restricted cash of million. Restricted cash primarily includes restricted cash required under UACC's securitization transactions and Warehouse Credit Facilities of million. The Company has historically had negative cash flows and generated losses from operations and the Company s primary source of liquidity has been cash generated through financing activities. In January 2024, the Company announced its Value Maximization Plan pursuant to which it discontinued its ecommerce operations and wound-down its used vehicle dealership business. Refer to Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation Value Maximization Plan. As a result of the liquidation of the Company's vehicle inventory as part of the Ecommerce Wind-Down, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the 2022 Vehicle Floorplan Facility in the first quarter of 2024 and the agreement was terminated. As of September 30, 2024 , UACC has warehouse credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing limit of million and outstanding borrowings of million with excess borrowing capacity of million. The terms of the facilities generally mature within two years and the Company typically renews the facilities in the ordinary course. Currently, all four Warehouse Credit Facilities expire between June and September 2025. Refer to Note 9 Warehouse Credit Facilities and Consolidated VIEs. The Company has commenced discussions with its lenders to extend the terms beyond the current expiration dates and, consistent with prior periods, expects those facilities to be amended and renewed. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Warehouse Credit Facilities. Failure to secure warehouse borrowing capacity beyond the expiration of the current facilities in 2025 or failure to satisfy the covenants therein and or any other requirements contained within the agreements would restrict access to the Warehouse Credit Facilities and would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of the Company. Certain breaches of covenants may also result in acceleration of the repayment of borrowings prior to the scheduled maturity. Refer to Note 9 Warehouse Credit Facilities of Consolidated VIEs for further discussion. The Company expects to use cash and cash equivalents to finance future capital requirements and UACC s Warehouse Credit Facilities to fund finance receivables. Certain advance rates available to UACC on borrowings from the Warehouse Credit Facilities have decreased as a result of the increasing credit losses in UACC s portfolio and overall rising interest rates. Any future decreases on available advance rates may have an adverse impact on the Company's liquidity. If the Company undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, with respect to the Notes), subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes may require the Company to immediately repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The delisting of the Company s common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market would constitute a fundamental change under the terms of the Indenture. Nasdaq maintains several standards for continued listing of the Company s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. For example, under the equity standard , the Company is required to have stockholders equity of at least 10 million, among other requirements. Under the total asset standard , the market value of the Company s publicly held shares must be at least 15 million, among other requirements. Only one standard has to be met to comply with Nasdaq requirements. The Company currently meets the "total asset standard". If the Company is not able to satisfy a continued listing requirement from Nasdaq and its common stock is delisted, it will be required to repurchase the Notes prior to their maturity, as discussed above. As of September 30, 2024, and as of the date of issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to repurchase the Notes in the event of a fundamental change and would be required to seek financing or otherwise restructure its existing capital structure. Such financing may not be available to the Company on favorable terms, or at all. On November 12, 2024, the Company announced its entry into the RSA and its intention to commence the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. The RSA contemplates and the Plan proposes that, upon

 of the New Common Stock (subject to dilution by the New Warrants, the MIP, and the Post-Effective Date Equity Awards, all terms as defined therein). On the Plan Effective Date, all notes, instruments, certificates, and other documents evidencing Unsecured Notes Claims will be canceled and/or updated to record such cancellation and the obligations of the Debtor thereunder or in any way related thereto will be deemed satisfied in full and discharged. As discussed herein, the consummation of the Plan is subject to numerous conditions and the Plan may not be consummated, including if the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case is not commenced for any reason. The Company may be delisted by Nasdaq due the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, and the Company may be unable to relist on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. The Company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the outcome of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, the ability to realize the benefits of the Value Maximization Plan, available advance rates on and the amendment and renewal of the Warehouse Credit Facilities, the ability to continue to meet the requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the ability to complete additional securitization transactions on terms favorable to the Company, and future credit losses. While the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern due to the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, as discussed in Note 1, above.

 for the 2022-1 securitization transaction and for the 2022-2, 2023-1, and 2024-1 securitization transactions of the outstanding principal balance of the finance receivables serviced. Late charges and other fees are calculated at predetermined amounts or percentages of overdue finance receivable balances and are recorded on a cash basis. From January to March 2023, UACC waived the monthly servicing fees related to the 2022-2 securitization transaction, which resulted in consolidation of the 2022-2 VIE. Servicing fees related to the 2022-2, 2023-1, and 2024-1 securitization transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Refer to Note 4 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations. Warranties and GAP income Prior to the Ecommerce Wind-Down, the Company offered third-party financing and third-party value-added products such as vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection GAP and tire and wheel coverage, to its used vehicle customers pursuant to arrangements with the third parties that sell and administered these products and are responsible for their fulfillment. UACC also offers third-party vehicle service contracts and United Auto Credit GAP to consumers who obtain financing through UACC. United Auto Credit GAP is a debt waiver product that is underwritten directly by UACC. It provides protection for consumers who purchase the product by waiving the difference between the actual cash value of the consumer s vehicle and the balance of the consumer s contract, subject to the terms and conditions of the United Auto Credit GAP, in the event of a total loss resulting from collision or theft. The total fees are earned over the contractual life of the related finance receivables on straight-line basis. The Company concluded that it is an agent for any transactions with third-parties because it does not control the products before they are transferred to the consumer. The Company recognizes revenue on a net basis when the consumer enters into an arrangement for the products. A portion of the fees earned on third-party financing and value-added products is subject to chargebacks in the event of early termination, default, or prepayment of the contracts by end-customers. The Company s exposure for these events is limited to the fees that it receives. An estimated refund liability for chargebacks against the revenue recognized from sales of these products is recorded in the period in which the related revenue is recognized and is based primarily on the Company s historical chargeback experience. The Company updates its estimates at each reporting date. As of

 million and million, respectively, which are included within Other liabilities. The Company also is contractually entitled to receive profit-sharing revenues based on the performance of the vehicle service policies once a required claims period has passed. The Company recognizes profit-sharing revenues to the extent it is probable that it will not result in a significant revenue reversal. The Company estimates the revenue based on historical claims and cancellation data from its customers, as well as other qualitative assumptions. The Company reassesses the estimate at each reporting period with any changes reflected as an adjustment to warranties and GAP income in the period identified. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, related to cumulative profit-sharing payments to which it expects to be entitled, which are included within Other assets." CarStory Revenue CarStory generates advertiser, publisher and other user service revenue. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been performed, collection of the fees is reasonably assured, the fees are fixed or determinable, and no significant obligations by the Company remain. Generally, this results in revenues billed and recorded monthly in the month that services were performed and earned. Deferred revenue includes advances received from customers in excess of revenue recognized. The Company may collect sales taxes and other taxes and government fees from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale as required. These taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in revenues or cost of sales.

 million of rated asset-backed securities in an auto finance receivable securitization transaction from a securitization trust, established and sponsored by UACC for proceeds of million. The trust is collateralized by finance receivables with an aggregate principal balance of million as of April 30, 2024. These finance receivables are serviced by UACC and UACC receives an "at market" servicing fee . As a result of market conditions, the Company retained the residual interests, therefore the 2024-1 securitization was accounted for as secured borrowings and remains on balance sheet pending the sale of such retained interests. The Company also repurchased million of the non-investment grade securities related to the 2022-2 securitization transaction for million. In 2023, UACC completed the 2023-1 securitization transaction, in which it sold rated asset-backed non-investment grade securities, for proceeds of million. UACC still retains the residual interests related to the 2023-1 securitization transaction and therefore consolidated the 2023-1 VIE and accounted for this transaction as a secured borrowing. The trust is collateralized by finance receivables with an aggregate principal balance of million as of January 31, 2023. These finance receivables are serviced by UACC. UACC retained the servicing rights to these finance receivables and receives an "at market" servicing fee. UACC is the primary beneficiary of the 2024-1 and 2023-1 securitization trusts, as it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. UACC also retained a portion of the economic interests in the 2024-1 and 2023-1 asset-backed securitization transactions, in the form of residual interests in accordance with Regulation RR of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Risk Retention Rules"). The Risk Retention Rules require the Company to retain at least of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts. Refer to Note 10 Long Term Debt for further details. In July 2022, UACC sold a pool of finance receivables in the 2022-2 securitization transaction. UACC retained the servicing rights to these finance receivables and receives an "at market" servicing fee. UACC retained an insignificant amount of the asset-backed securities issued in the securitization in order to comply with Risk Retention Rules. Originally, the Company concluded that it was not the primary beneficiary of the 2022-2 securitization trust because UACC retained interests in the VIE are insignificant. Therefore, the Company did not originally consolidate the 2022-2 trust. From January to March 2023, although not contractually required, UACC elected to waive its servicing fee on the 2022-2 securitization, due to higher-than-expected losses, which transferred more than an insignificant portion of the corresponding risk of loss from the VIE to the Company. Since UACC has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE, as it is the servicer, and additionally it absorbs the risk of loss, the Company concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. In March 2023, the Company accounted for the transaction as secured borrowings and consolidated the 2022-2 securitization trust. The beneficial interest was then eliminated. The VIE model allows for a measurement alternative when a reporting entity elects the fair value option and consolidates a collateralized financing entity CFE ). This measurement alternative eliminates the accounting mismatch that may arise from measurement differences between the CFE s financial assets and third-party financial liabilities in earnings and attributes those earnings to the controlling equity interest in the consolidated income statement. The 2022-2 and 2023-1 securitization trusts consolidated by UACC meet the definition of a CFE and the Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative when consolidating these VIEs. Refer to Note 14 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements for further detail. UACC has senior secured warehouse credit facilities. Through trusts, UACC entered into warehouse facility agreements with certain banking institutions, primarily to finance the purchase and origination of finance receivables as well as to provide funding for general operating activities. These trusts are secured by eligible finance receivables which are pledged as collateral for the warehouse facilities. These trusts are consolidated VIEs. Refer to Note 9 Warehouse Credit Facilities of Consolidated VIEs for further details on the warehouse facilities.

 UACC establishes securitization trusts to purchase finance receivables. The securitization trusts issue asset-backed securities, which are collateralized by the finance receivables that UACC sells to the securitization trusts. Upon sale of the finance receivables to the securitization trusts, the Company recognizes a gain or loss on sales of finance receivables if it determines it qualifies for sale accounting treatment and it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE or accounts for these securitization transactions as secured borrowings when it is the primary beneficiary. In February 2022, UACC sold a pool of finance receivables in the 2022-1 securitization transaction. UACC retained the servicing rights to these finance receivables and receives an "at market" servicing fee. UACC retained an insignificant amount of the asset-backed securities issued in the securitization in order to comply with Risk Retention Rules. The 2022-1 securitization trust is a VIE that the Company does not consolidate. As the servicer, UACC retained the power to direct the activities that are most significant to the VIE, however, the Company concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of the 2022-1 securitization trust because UACC's retained interests in the VIE are insignificant. The beneficial interest retained by UACC included rated notes and unrated residual certificates issued by the 2022-1 securitization trust.

These securities are interests in securitization trusts, thus there are no contractual maturities. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company entered into a Risk Retention Financing Facility to finance the majority of its retained beneficial interests in securitizations.

The Company's ability to utilize its Warehouse Credit Facilities is primarily conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants contained within the agreements. These include covenants that require UACC to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, minimum liquidity levels, specified leverage ratios and certain indebtedness levels. Failure to satisfy these and or any other requirements contained within the agreements would restrict access to the Warehouse Credit Facilities. Certain breaches of covenants may also result in acceleration of the repayment of borrowings prior to the scheduled maturity.

The case is captioned Federal Trade Commission v. Vroom, Inc. et al., Case No. 4:24-cv-02496.

According to the petition, 80 of the customer complaints referenced in the petition were received in the 12 months prior to April 2022. The petition is captioned State of Texas v. Vroom Automotive LLC, and Vroom Inc., Case No. D-1-GN-001809. In May 2022, Vroom Automotive, LLC and the Attorney General of the State of Texas agreed to a temporary injunction in which Vroom Automotive, LLC agreed to adhere to its existing practice of possessing title for all vehicles it sells or advertises as available for sale on its ecommerce platform. In December 2023, Vroom, Inc., Vroom Automotive, LLC and the Attorney General of the State of Texas reached a final agreement to resolve all claims in the petition, without any admission of wrongdoing by either Vroom entity.

Valuation Methodologies of Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for financial instruments carried at fair value. These methodologies are applied to financial assets and liabilities across the fair value levels discussed above, and it is the observability of the inputs used that determines the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for the respective asset or liability. Money Market Funds: Money market funds primarily consist of investments in highly liquid U.S. treasury securities, with original maturities of three months or less and are classified as Level 1. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents based on quoted prices in active markets. Financial assets and liabilities of CFEs: In accordance with ASC 825, the Company has elected the fair value option, for the eligible financial assets and liabilities of the 2022-2 and 2023-1 consolidated CFEs in order to mitigate potential accounting mismatches between the carrying value of the financial assets and liabilities. To eliminate potential measurement differences, the Company elected the measurement alternative included in ASC 810-30, allowing the Company to measure both the financial assets and liabilities of a qualifying CFE using the fair value of either the CFE s financial assets or liabilities, whichever is more observable. Under the measurement alternative prescribed by ASC 810-30, the Company recognizes changes in the CFE s net assets, including changes in fair value adjustments and net interest earned, in its condensed consolidated statements of operations.

reportable segments: UACC and CarStory. Corporate activities are presented in "corporate" and do not constitute a reportable segment. These activities include costs not directly attributable to the segments and are primarily related to costs associated with corporate and governance functions, including executive functions, corporate finance, legal, human resources, information technology, cyber security and other shared costs. Certain shared costs, including corporate administration, are allocated to segments based upon specific allocation of expenses. Corporate activities also include the runoff of legacy Vroom third party vehicle service and GAP policies sold prior to the Ecommerce Wind-Down as well as certain Vroom contracts that have been renegotiated and right-sized to account for reduced headcount following the Ecommerce Wind-down. The Company retrospectively restated segment results for the comparative period to conform to the new presentation. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company determined its operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker CODM reviews the Company s operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM reviews Adjusted EBITDA for each of the reportable segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest expense on corporate debt, interest income on cash and cash equivalents, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, stock compensation expense, severance expense related to the continuing operations, gain on debt extinguishment and long-lived asset impairment charges, incurred by the segment. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information as these are managed on an enterprise-wide group basis. Accordingly, the Company does t report segment asset information. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, long-lived assets were predominantly located in the United States.

and , respectively. The Company s effective tax rate from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. The Company is subject to tax in the United States and many state and local jurisdictions. The Company, with certain exceptions, is no longer subject to income tax examinations by U.S. federal, state and local for tax years 2017 and prior. The company is not currently under audit for any US federal or state income tax audits. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 provides for a limitation of the annual use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes (as defined by the IRC Section 382) that limits the Company s ability to utilize these carryforwards. The Company completed a Section 382 study to determine the applicable limitation, if any. It was determined that the Company has undergone four ownership changes the most recent of which was April 2021. These changes will limit the use of the net operating losses generated before the change in control. The Company has t identified any uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions shall be recorded as a component of income tax expense. To date, interest or penalties have been accrued in relation to uncertain tax positions. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("IRA") was signed into law. The IRA includes implementation of a new alternative minimum tax, an excise tax on stock buybacks, and significant tax incentives for energy and climate initiatives, among other provisions. The Company evaluated the provisions included under the IRA and the provisions do not have a material impact to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Reported amounts reflect the revisions discussed in Note 18 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. As discussed in the section titled "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and in the section titled "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report ), as updated by reference into the section titled "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additionally, our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. 
 
 Recent Events 
 
 Recapitalization of Balance Sheet Debt: Entry into the RSA and Anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case 
 
 On November 12, 2024, we entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the RSA with creditors holding, in the aggregate, over 80 of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes (as defined below) and the largest shareholder. The RSA contemplates a comprehensive restructuring of the Company s debt obligations and capital structure to be implemented through a prepackaged plan of reorganization (the Plan to be implemented through the anticipated filing of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case (as defined below). Capitalized terms used in this section but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the RSA. 
 
 In connection with the restructuring contemplated by the anticipated filing of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, the ordinary course operations of Vroom, Inc. s subsidiaries are expected to continue with minimal impact, if any, and trade creditors and all other general unsecured creditors are expected to be unimpaired. If the Plan is consummated, we will emerge without any remaining Notes, but will maintain UACC s Warehouse Credit Facilities (as defined below), securitization debt, financing of beneficial interest in securitizations, and junior subordinated debentures. 
 
 Vroom, Inc. (in the context of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, the Debtor is expected to commence a voluntary proceeding (the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court ). We plan to continue to operate our business as a debtor-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. We plan to seek approval of certain first day motions containing customary relief intended to assure our ability to continue ordinary course operations. None of Vroom, Inc. s subsidiaries are expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings. 
 
 Our pursuit of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case is intended to address the impact of the Notes and their upcoming maturity, or any potential acceleration, while providing the potential for our stockholders to retain value in their investment, limiting disruption to our ongoing ordinary course operations, emerging as a public company without any long-term debt at the Vroom, Inc. level, and maximizing the ability to utilize a substantial portion of our net operating losses. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on our Notes and the potential restructuring of our debt obligations as a result of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, and Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors for risks associated with the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case and our ability to realize its intended benefits. 
 
 Commitments and Representations . Each of the Debtor and the Consenting Stakeholders have made certain customary commitments and representations in the RSA. The Debtor has agreed, among other things, to support and take all commercially reasonable actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate the restructuring and meet milestones set forth in the RSA. The Consenting Stakeholders have committed to the Debtor, among other things, to support and vote for the Plan and use their commercially reasonable efforts to consummate and complete the restructuring. 
 
 52 

Table of Contents 

Milestones . The RSA contains milestones ("Milestones") relating to the progress of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, which include, among other things, entry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court confirming the Plan and approving the related disclosure statement no later than 60 days following the Petition Date and the occurrence of the date on which the Plan has become effective in accordance with its terms (the Plan Effective Date no later than 75 days following the Petition Date. 
 
 Termination . Each of the parties to the RSA may terminate the agreement (and thereby their support for the Plan) under certain limited circumstances, including, among other things: (i) in the case of the Company and the Consenting Noteholders, the failure to meet the Milestones; (ii) the occurrence of certain breaches of the RSA; (iii) the mutual agreement of the parties; and (iv) in the case of the Company, if the Board, members, or managers, as applicable, of the Company reasonably determines in good faith and based upon advice of outside legal counsel that performance under the RSA would be inconsistent with its applicable fiduciary duties. 
 
 Consummation . Consummation of the restructuring contemplated by the RSA is subject to approval of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court and other conditions. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the transactions described therein will be consummated. 
 
 Summary of Material Terms . The following is a summary of the material terms of the restructuring that are set forth in the Plan: 
 
 The capital structure of the reorganized Debtor upon the Plan Effective Date will consist of the new common stock to be issued by the reorganized Debtor on the Plan Effective Date (the New Common Stock ), distributed to (a) the holders of Unsecured Notes Claims; and (b) the holders of Existing Equity Interests, and resulting in pro forma ownership percentages of (x) 92.94 of the New Common Stock held by the holders of Unsecured Notes Claims; and (y) 7.06 of the New Common Stock held by holders of Existing Equity Interests; in each case, subject to dilution by the (i) New Warrants, (ii) the MIP Awards, and (iii) the Post-Effective Date Equity Awards. 

Promptly following the Plan Effective Date, the New Board will approve and implement the Management Incentive Plan (the MIP ). The RSU Awards and the ESO Grants will be granted subject to approval by the New Board, with the allocation of such grants to be determined in good faith by the New Board in consultation with the reorganized company s chief executive officer. 

The reorganized company reserves the right to register the New Warrants with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC by filing a Registration Statement on Form S-1 in its discretion if it determines that doing so would be necessary or desirable in connection with the trading of such securities. As contemplated, the New Warrants will have the following key terms: 

o Number: The New Warrants will be for the purchase of an aggregate of 1,808,243 shares of New Common Stock, equal to the number of presently existing outstanding shares of common stock of the Company; 

o Exercise Price: The New Warrants will have an exercise price of 12.19 per share; 

o Expiration: The New Warrants will expire on the 5th anniversary of the Plan Effective Date; 

o Anti-Dilution Protections: The New Warrants will contain customary anti-dilution protection for stock splits, stock dividends, and similar events but will not have Black-Scholes protections; and 

o Transferability: The New Warrants will be freely transferable, subject to applicable securities laws. 

The Plan is attached as an exhibit to the RSA, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto. Under the Plan, certain classes of claims will receive upon consummation the following treatment: 
 Holders of Other Priority Claims, Secured Claims, General Unsecured Claims, and 510(b) Claims will be unimpaired. 

Each holder of Claims under the Unsecured Notes Indenture (the Unsecured Notes Claims will receive, except to the extent that such holder agrees in writing to less favorable treatment, on the Effective Date, its pro rata share of 92.94 of the New Common Stock (subject to dilution by (i) the New Warrants, (ii) the MIP Awards, and (iii) the Post-Effective Date Equity Awards). 

53 

Table of Contents 

Each holder of any Equity Security or other ownership interest in the Debtor as in existence immediately before the Plan Effective Date, but excluding any Existing Equity Awards (the Existing Equity Interests ), will receive, except to the extent that such holder agrees in writing to less favorable treatment, on the Effective Date, (i) its pro rata share of 7.06 of the New Common Stock (subject to dilution by (a) the New Warrants, (b) the MIP Awards, and (c) the Post-Effective Date Equity Awards) and (ii) the right to receive New Warrants in an amount equal to its pro rata share of Existing Equity Interests. 

Except to the extent the holder of any options or restricted stock units representing rights to purchase or acquire any Equity Securities of the Debtor as in existence immediately before the Plan Effective Date (the Existing Equity Awards, and together with the Existing Equity Interests, the Equity Interests agrees in writing to less favorable treatment, on the Effective Date, all Existing Equity Awards will be converted into new awards (the Post-Effective Date Equity Awards exchangeable into New Common Stock on the same terms and conditions, and for the same number of units, applicable to the Existing Equity Awards in respect of the Existing Equity Interests, as of immediately prior to the Plan Effective Date. 

In connection with the restructuring, trade creditors and all other general unsecured creditors are expected to be unimpaired. 
 
 As described above, the Plan contemplates for the amendment and restatement, effective upon approval by the New Board, of the Company s 2020 Incentive Award Plan in order to implement the MIP, pursuant to which 10 of the New Common Stock (as defined in the Plan) outstanding on a fully diluted basis as of immediately following emergence may be issued in the form of restricted stock unit awards and 5 of the New Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis as of immediately following emergence may be issued in the form of stock options to certain employees of the Debtor, in each case on the terms set forth in the MIP Term Sheet. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 As described above, we are contemplating the filing of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. We believe we will be able to emerge from bankruptcy and continue to operate as a viable going concern. However, there is no assurance that: (a) the Plan will become effective, (b) the Plan will ultimately be approved by the requisite voting creditors and interest holders and confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, (c) the Bankruptcy Court will grant or deny motions in a manner that is not adverse to the Debtor, and (d) the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case will not be converted into cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The transactions contemplated by the RSA and Plan are subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, among other conditions. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that the transactions described therein will be consummated. 
 
 Due to the uncertainties described above, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon our plans, which includes, among other things, our ability to, subject to the approval by the Bankruptcy Court, implement a comprehensive restructuring and successfully emerge from the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. Despite the anticipated Chapter 11 filing, we retain sufficient liquidity, with approximately 51.1 million of unrestricted cash on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, and we continue to meet our obligations to customers, vendors, counterparties and employees in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates that we will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for twelve months following the issuance date. Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 
 
 Value Maximization Plan 
 
 On January 22, 2024, we announced that our Board had approved the Value Maximization Plan, pursuant to which we discontinued our ecommerce operations and wound down our used vehicle dealership business in order to preserve liquidity and enable us to maximize stakeholder value through our remaining businesses. We have ceased transacting through vroom.com, completed transactions for customers who had previously contracted with us to purchase or sell a vehicle, halted purchases of additional vehicles, sold substantially all of our used vehicle inventory through wholesale channels and paid off our 2022 Vehicle Floorplan Facility. We continue to take other actions to maximize 
 54 

Table of Contents 

stakeholder value by seeking to monetize our legacy ecommerce platform, reduce our outstanding commitments and preserve our liquidity, and have executed a reduction-in-force commensurate with our reduced operations. On March 29, 2024, we substantially completed the wind-down of our ecommerce operations and used vehicle dealership business the "Ecommerce Wind-Down") , however, we may incur additional wind-down costs through the end of 2024. 
 
 We also own and operate UACC, a leading automotive finance company that offers vehicle financing to consumers through third-party dealers under the UACC brand, and CarStory, an artificial intelligence ("AI")-powered analytics and digital services platform for automotive retail. The UACC and CarStory businesses continue to serve their third-party customers, with their operations substantially unaffected by the Ecommerce Wind-Down. We will seek to grow and enhance the profitability of the UACC and CarStory businesses going forward. 
 
 As a result of the Value Maximization Plan, we estimate that we will incur total cash charges during 2024 of approximately 15.9 million for severance and other personnel-related costs, with 15.8 million incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and approximately 13.9 million in contract and lease termination costs, with the total amount settled during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As part of a planned reduction-in-force under the Value Maximization Plan, approximately 800 employees were impacted by the wind-down, resulting in a reduction of approximately 93 of the employees not engaged in UACC s or CarStory s ongoing operations. 
 
 Overview 
 
 Vroom owns United Auto Credit Corporation, a leading automotive finance company that offers vehicle financing to consumers through third-party dealers under the UACC brand, and the CarStory business, a leader in AI-powered analytics and digital services for automotive retail. 
 
 UACC 
 
 UACC, which Vroom acquired in February 2022, is an indirect lender that offers vehicle financing to consumers through third-party dealers under the UACC brand, focusing primarily on the non-prime market. Prior to the Ecommerce Wind-Down, UACC also offered vehicle financing to Vroom s customers through its ecommerce platform. 
 
 UACC, which has been engaged in automotive finance since 1996, currently offers financing services to a nationwide network of thousands of independent motor vehicle dealers and manufacturer-franchised dealers in 49 states, and we seek to optimize that network over time. UACC enables these dealers to finance their customers' purchases of automobiles, medium and light duty trucks and vans with competitive financing terms. The credit programs offered by UACC are primarily designed to serve consumers who have limited access to traditional motor vehicle financing. 
 
 In addition to its financing expertise, the UACC platform brings with it extensive application processing, underwriting, and servicing capabilities. UACC services the retail installment sales contracts it originates or purchases and will continue to service the contracts it originated or purchased for customers of Vroom s former ecommerce business. Because UACC focuses primarily on the non-prime market, it generally sustains a higher level of delinquencies and credit losses than that experienced by traditional motor vehicle financing sources. As of September 30, 2024, UACC serviced a portfolio of approximately 80,000 retail installment sales contracts with an aggregate principal outstanding balance of 1.1 billion. 
 
 CarStory 
 
 CarStory is a leader in AI-powered analytics and digital services for automotive retail. CarStory offers its digital retailing services to dealers, automotive financial services companies and others in the automotive industry, which use CarStory s solutions to enhance their customer experience and drive increased vehicle purchases. 
 
 CarStory drives automotive retail innovation by aggregating, optimizing and distributing data from thousands of automotive sources. CarStory tracks over three and a half million unique vehicle identification numbers ("VINs") listed for sale every day. This data is aggregated with demand insights from millions of consumer sessions and VIN data from CarStory's proprietary VIN database to generate accurate price and sales predictions. CarStory helps dealers optimize their pricing by leveraging data science models for retail pricing that provide predictive pricing for marketing, buying, selling and VIN-level features.

Table of Contents 

In addition to its data analytics and digital services, CarStory powers white labeled storefronts for automotive marketplaces and finance companies. In developing its white label capabilities, CarStory also has developed a variety of consumer-focused functions designed to enhance the customer experience and drive conversion. CarStory's data and data science assets create significant opportunity for automotive AI product development, with over 200 million VINs, over three billion photos, and price and price elasticity models. 
 
 Long-term Strategic Plan 
 
 Since the announcement of the Value Maximization Plan in January 2024, we have been focused on building a long-term strategic plan leveraging our remaining assets to improve the profitability of the business and achieve three key objectives: achieve pre-COVID Cumulative Net Losses (CNL) or lower, grow origination with pre-COVID CNL or lower, and lower operating cost. 
 
 In order to achieve these objectives, we are focused on four strategic initiatives: 
 
 Build a world class lending program: Focus on using advanced models and analytics to predict losses and drive profitable growth, bringing subprime CNL to pre-COVID levels. Expand the near-prime program to enable UACC to become a more significant partner to dealers. 

Build a world class sales and marketing program: Attract and retain the best dealers and drive deeper dealer engagement to enable growth. Improve the Fast Lane, a portal built to provide the dealer with everything they need from application through contracting. 

Build operational excellence in originations: Enhance systemic capabilities and decisioning for a more efficient process. Integrate Vroom patent-pending AI agent into UACC's funding process to reduce costs, improve accuracy, and reduce fraud. Build a pre-verification automated engine to improve dealer service, improve credit quality and increase capture rates. 

Build operational excellence in servicing: Utilize data science, advanced analytics and technology to enable an improved approach to servicing effectiveness. Utilize the native consumer mobile app, which was launched in September 2024, to improve customer engagement and communication and target more on-time payments. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental performance measures that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use these measures for business planning purposes. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 We calculate EBITDA as net loss before interest expense on corporate debt, interest income on cash and cash equivalents, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. 
 
 We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to exclude stock compensation expense, severance expense related to the continuing operations, gain on debt extinguishment and long-lived asset impairment charges.

Key Factors and Trends Affecting our Operating Results 
 
 Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors and trends, including the following: 
 
 Anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case 
 
 We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, including the impact on our liquidity, cash balances, and Nasdaq listing status. In addition, the entry into the RSA and the anticipated filing of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case has consumed, and is expected to continue to consume, a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. Our business could also suffer from a long and protracted restructuring. Furthermore, we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. All of these factors could limit our ability to pursue growth strategies for our business in the near- to mid-term. 
 
 Ability to manage credit losses 
 
 While credit losses are inherent in the automotive finance receivables business, several variables have affected UACC s recent loss and delinquency rates, including rising interest rates, the current inflationary environment and vehicle depreciation. UACC is currently experiencing higher loss severity and higher losses on its finance receivables, which has negatively impacted the fair value of our finance receivables and the losses recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and are expected to continue to negatively impact our business for the remainder of 2024. UACC primarily operates in the non-prime sector of the market which tends to have more volatility. In 2020 and 2021, COVID related stimulus and used vehicle appreciation resulted in significantly lower delinquencies and subsequent losses. In late 2022 and 2023, delinquencies and loss rates rose as a result of the aforementioned factors and, in response, we implemented changes to our credit program, such as tightening credit, which is starting to return our delinquencies and expected portfolio performance on those vintages to normalized levels. We also intend to leverage CarStory data to improve VIN-level valuations to support underwriting decisions and servicing operations. Certain advance rates available to UACC on borrowings from the Warehouse Credit Facilities have decreased as a result of the increasing credit losses in UACC's portfolio and overall rising interest rates. Any future decreases on available advance rates may have an adverse impact on our liquidity. 
 57 

Table of Contents 

Enhance profitability at UACC 
 In addition to higher credit losses, UACC s ability to achieve profitability has been negatively affected by increased operating expenses and productivity challenges. Also, we have identified vulnerabilities in certain IT systems and determined additional investment will be needed to update and secure those systems. We are undertaking a number of initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, introduce improved processes, and reporting metrics across UACC s operations, invest in IT systems, improve origination and servicing productivity, and leverage CarStory data to improve underwriting and servicing performance. We intend to grow UACC s business profitably by reducing credit losses, increasing UACC s market share, and streamlining its operations. 
 
 Ability to continue to access capital 
 
 UACC has four Warehouse Credit Facilities, which are primarily used to finance the origination of finance receivables as well as to provide funding for general operating activities. UACC has also developed a securitization program that involves selling finance receivables to securitization trusts through the private issuance of asset-backed securities which are collateralized by the finance receivables. 
 
 The success of UACC's business is highly dependent on the ability to continue to access capital through both its warehousing arrangements and securitization program. As a result of high interest rates, the current inflationary environment and vehicle depreciation in the used automotive industry, UACC is experiencing higher loss severity. Certain advance rates available to UACC on borrowings from UACC s four senior secured warehouse credit facility agreements (the Warehouse Credit Facilities have decreased as a result of the increasing credit losses in UACC's portfolio and overall rising interest rates. Any future decreases on available advance rates may have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Currently, all four Warehouse Credit Facilities expire between June and September 2025. We have commenced discussions with our lenders to extend the terms beyond the current expiration dates and, consistent with prior periods, expect those facilities to be amended and renewed. We believe that our ability to eliminate our long-term debt obligations under the Notes in connection with the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan may support our position as we engage in these discussions with our Warehouse Credit Facilities lenders. However, there can be no assurance that adequate additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. See Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors We may not generate sufficient liquidity to operate our business, and, UACC may be unable to continue to access or renew funding sources and obtain capital needed to maintain and grow its business. 
 
 In addition, due to UACC's increased credit losses, UACC may not be able to securitize its loan portfolio on favorable terms, or may not be able to sell the subordinate notes or residual certificates issued in its securitizations at a favorable price or at all. As a result of market conditions at the time, UACC retained the residual interests for the 2023-1 and 2024-1 securitization transactions. 
 
 Ability to optimize our dealer network to increase vehicle finance offerings 
 
 We intend to moderately grow our automotive financing business while focusing on achieving profitability. UACC will seek to optimize its dealer network over time. UACC provides funding that allows independent motor vehicle dealers and manufacturer-franchised dealers to finance vehicles for their customers. Currently, UACC serves a nationwide network of thousands of dealers in 49 states. UACC's credit programs are primarily designed to serve consumers in the non-prime market, who have limited access to traditional vehicle financing, although UACC intends to expand its offerings across a broader range of the credit spectrum going forward and has launched a pilot program for near-prime consumers. We also intend to drive dealer and customer engagement through technology innovations. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Used vehicle sales have historically been seasonal. The used vehicle industry typically experiences an increase in sales early in the calendar year and reaches its highest point late in the first quarter and early in the second quarter. Vehicle sales then level off through the rest of the year, with the lowest level of sales in the fourth quarter. This seasonality has historically corresponded with the timing of income tax refunds, which are an important source of funding for vehicle purchases. Consistent with market trends, UACC generally experiences increased funding activity during the first quarter through tax season. Delinquencies also tend to be lower during the first quarter through tax season and higher during the latter half of the year.

Operations We may experience seasonal and other fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations, which may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business in our Annual Report. 
 
 Macroeconomic Factors 
 
 Both the United States and global economies are experiencing a sustained inflationary environment and the Federal Reserve s efforts to tame inflation have led to increased interest rates, which affects automotive finance rates and our borrowing rates, reducing discretionary spending and making vehicle financing more costly and less accessible to many consumers. In December 2023, the Federal Reserve announced that it expects to cut interest rates in 2024; in September 2024 they enacted the first interest rate cut by reducing benchmark rates by half a percentage point. It is too soon to know when and to what degree rates may be cut further and the impact it may have on the economy. Moreover, geopolitical conflicts and war, including those in Europe and the Middle East, have increased global economic and political uncertainty, which has caused dramatic fluctuations in global financial markets. A significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption could continue to impact consumer spending, broaden inflationary costs, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We will continue to actively monitor and develop responses to these disruptions, but depending on duration and severity, these trends could continue to negatively impact our business for the remainder of 2024.

Interest income 
 
 UACC acquires and services finance receivables from its network of third-party dealership customers and generates interest income, which consists of discount income and interest income. Discount income represents the amortization of unearned discounts over the contractual life of the underlying finance receivables held for investment at fair value. Discounts on the finance receivables held-for-sale are deferred until they are sold. 
 
 For securitization transactions that are accounted for as secured borrowings, we recognize interest income in accordance with the terms of the related retail installment sale contracts. Interest income also includes the runoff portfolio of retail installment sale contracts originated for Vroom or purchased from Vroom prior to the Ecommerce Wind-Down. 
 
 For securitization transactions that are accounted as a sale of finance receivables in accordance with ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets ("ASC 860"), we recognize a gain on sale of finance receivables. There were no securitizations which were accounted for as sales in the periods presented.

Table of Contents 

Interest income increased 2.7 million, or 5.7 , to 50.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 48.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily a result of new originations, which increased the loan portfolio to 850.6 million as of September 30, 2024 from 800.5 million as of September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income was partially offset by lower amortization of discount income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of a lower balance of finances receivables held for investment measured at fair value, with discount being amortized, as compared to finance receivables held for sale with discount deferred until receivables are sold. The outstanding balance of finance receivables held for investment at fair value was 210.0 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 400.7 million as of September 30, 2023. The outstanding balance of finance receivables held for sale was 640.6 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 399.8 million as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest expense 
 
 Interest expense primarily includes interest expense on UACC's Warehouse Credit Facilities, interest expense incurred on securitization debt, and interest expense on financing of beneficial interests in securitizations. 
 
 Interest expense increased 3.7 million or 31.9 to 15.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 11.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of higher interest expense incurred on the Warehouse Credit Facilities, which increased 0.7 million to 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as well as higher interest expense incurred on securitization debt, which increased 3.0 million to 9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of interest expense incurred on the Warehouse Credit Facilities is attributable to a higher outstanding balance of 321.8 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 294.7 million as of September 30, 2023, due to financing the larger finance receivable portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rates, which decreased from 7.23 to 6.97 . The increase of interest expense incurred on securitization debt is attributable to a higher outstanding balance of 410.1 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 361.9 million as of September 30, 2023 as well as overall higher interest rates as securitization debt interest rates are fixed. 
 
 Realized and unrealized losses, net of recoveries 
 
 Realized and unrealized losses, net of recoveries, primarily represents charge-offs of finance receivables held-for-sale, changes in the fair value of finance receivables for which the fair value option was selected under ASC 825, changes in the valuation allowance on the held-for-sale portfolio, changes in the fair value of securitization debt accounted in accordance with the measurement alternative under ASC 810-30, changes in the fair value of beneficial interest, as well as collection expenses related to servicing finance receivables. 
 
 Realized and unrealized losses, net of recoveries, decreased slightly by 0.2 million or 0.7 to 30.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 30.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Servicing income 	 
 
 Servicing income primarily represents the annual fees earned as a percentage of the outstanding principal balance of the finance receivables sold that were accounted for as off-balance sheet securitizations. When our securitizations are accounted for as secured borrowings, the servicing income we receive is eliminated in consolidation. In addition, we also earn other income generated from servicing our finance receivables portfolio, including late and other fees. 
 
 Servicing income decreased by 0.9 million or 38.5 to 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a lower balance of the 2022-1 securitization, which is accounted for as an off-balance sheet securitization. 
 
 Warranties and GAP income 
 
 UACC earns fees by selling third-party value-added products, such as vehicle service contracts. UACC is also contractually entitled to receive profit-sharing based on the performance of the vehicle service contract policies once a required claims period has passed. UACC recognizes a profit-share to the extent it is probable that it will not result in a

significant revenue reversal. The Company estimates the revenue based on historical claims and cancellation data from its consumers, as well as other qualitative assumptions. 
 
 United Auto Credit GAP is a debt waiver product that provides protection for consumers who purchase the product by waiving the difference between the actual cash value of the consumer s vehicle and the balance of the consumer s finance receivable, subject to the terms and conditions of the United Auto Credit GAP, in the event of a total loss resulting from collision or theft. The total fees are earned over the contractual life of the related financial receivables on straight-line basis. 
 	 
 Warranties and GAP income increased by 0.6 million or 39.5 to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of a revised estimate of proceeds we expect to recover. 
 
 Other income 
 
 Other income increased 1.1 million or 197.9 to 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by higher income related to acquisition fees for originations of finance receivables at fair value, which is recognized in the period the finance receivable is originated. 
 
 Compensation and benefits 
 
 Compensation and benefits increased 4.8 million or 32.3 to 19.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily a result of retention bonuses granted to retain key employees and a decrease in deferred acquisition costs as a result of accounting for the origination of all new finance receivables at fair value, with acquisition costs being expensed in the period incurred rather than deferred. 
 
 Professional fees 
 
 Professional fees decreased slightly by 0.1 million or 11.3 to 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Software and IT costs 
 
 Software and IT costs decreased 0.5 million or 16.2 to 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of more efficient targeted software use as well as renegotiating and right-sizing our Software and IT contracts. 
 
 Impairment charges 
 
 Impairment charges increased 2.4 million related to lease impairment charges incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other expenses 
 
 Other expenses increased 0.3 million or 19.5 to 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in deferred acquisition costs as a result of accounting for the origination of all new finance receivables at fair value, with acquisition costs being expensed in the period incurred rather than deferred, and an increase in dealer equity program expense. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA loss increased 4.3 million to 14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the 2.0 million increase in expenses after EBITDA adjustments, including compensation and benefits, professional fees, and other expenses, as discussed above.

Corporate activities do not constitute a reportable segment. These activities include costs not directly attributable to the segments and are primarily related to costs associated with corporate and governance functions, including executive functions, corporate finance, legal, human resources, information technology, cyber security and other shared costs. Certain shared costs, including corporate administration, are allocated to segments based upon a specific allocation of expenses. Corporate activities also include the runoff of legacy Vroom warranty and GAP policies sold prior to the Ecommerce Wind-Down as well as certain Vroom contracts, primarily Software and IT related, that have been renegotiated and right-sized to account for reduced headcount following the Ecommerce Wind-down. Adjusted EBITDA loss of 11.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is comprised of a loss of 8.5 million related to runoff of the legacy Vroom related items and ongoing contracts, and a loss of 2.7 million related to public company expenses. 
 
 Warranties and GAP income (loss), net 
 
 Prior to the Ecommerce Wind-Down, we offered value-added products to our customers pursuant to arrangements with the third parties that sell and administer these products as well as estimated profit-sharing amounts to which we are entitled based on the performance of third-party protection products once a required claims period has passed. A portion of the fees we received are subject to chargeback in the event of early termination, default, or prepayment of the contracts by our customers. Warranties and GAP income, net, recorded within Corporate, relates to the runoff of policies sold prior to the Ecommerce Wind-Down. 
 
 See Note 3 Revenue Recognition to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Warranties and GAP income increased 3.2 million or 237.4 to income of 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from a loss of 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a revised estimate of proceeds we expect to recover.

Other income 
 
 Other income primarily represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents. Other income decreased 0.8 million or 61.2 to 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by lower cash and cash equivalent balances and lower interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Compensation and benefits 
 
 Compensation and benefits expense decreased 0.1 million or 5.0 to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of severance expense related to the departure of certain executives and retention bonuses granted to retain key employees subsequent to the Ecommerce Wind-Down. 
 
 Professional fees 
 
 Professional fees decreased 1.8 million or 68.2 to 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of reduced audit, legal, and consulting fees as a result of the reduced size of the business. 
 
 Software and IT costs 
 
 Software and IT costs decreased 0.7 million or 41.9 to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of more efficient targeted software use as well as renegotiating and right-sizing our Software and IT contracts. 
 
 Other expenses 
 
 Other expenses decreased 0.7 million or 35.2 to 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to a decrease in public company related insurance costs as we renegotiated our insurance policies during the third quarter of 2023 and 2024 as a result of the reduced scale of the business.

Interest income 
 
 Interest income increased 23.8 million, or 18.2 , to 154.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 130.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily a result of new originations and the consolidation of our 2022-2 securitization, which increased the loan portfolio to 850.6 million as of September 30, 2024 from 800.5 million as of September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income was partially offset by lower discount income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of a smaller balance of finances receivables held for investment measured at fair value, with discount being amortized, as compared to finance receivables held for sale with discount deferred until receivables are sold. The outstanding balance of finance receivables held for investment at fair value was 210.0 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 400.7 million as of September 30, 
 67 

Table of Contents 

2023. The outstanding balance of finance receivables held for sale was 640.6 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 399.8 million as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest expense 
 
 Interest expense increased 15.9 million or 55.5 to 44.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 28.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of higher interest expense incurred on the Warehouse Credit Facilities, which increased 10.4 million to 22.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is attributable to a higher outstanding balance of 321.8 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 294.7 million as of September 30, 2023, due to financing the larger finance receivable portfolio. The increase in interest expense is also partially attributable to higher interest expense incurred on securitization debt, which increased 5.5 million to 22.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 16.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of a higher outstanding balance for securitization debt of 410.1 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 361.9 million as of September 30, 2023, as well as overall higher interest rates. 
 
 Realized and unrealized losses, net of recoveries 
 
 Realized and unrealized losses, net of recoveries, increased 14.5 million or 23.0 to 77.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 63.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in realized and unrealized losses on finance receivables as a result of a larger finance receivable portfolio, due to new originations as well as the consolidation of the 2022-2 securitization, which was previously off- balance sheet, as well as higher credit losses as of September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023. 
 
 Servicing income 	 
 
 Servicing income decreased by 2.7 million or 34.9 to 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a lower balance of the 2022-1 securitization, which is off-balance sheet. 
 
 Warranties and GAP income 
 	 
 Warranties and GAP income increased by 0.2 million or 3.0 to 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other Income 
 
 Other income increased 3.7 million or 140.9 to 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by higher income related to acquisition fees for originations of finance receivables at fair value, which is recognized in the period the finance receivable is originated. 
 
 Compensation and benefits 
 
 Compensation and benefits increased 9.2 million or 18.5 to 59.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 49.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily a result of the following: retention bonuses granted to retain key employees; allocation of incremental data and technology departments' time to UACC as a result of a shift in focus of the business; severance expense related to the termination of certain UACC employees; and a decrease in deferred acquisition costs as a result of accounting for the origination of all new finance receivables at fair value, with acquisition costs being expensed in the period incurred rather than deferred. 
 
 Professional fees 
 
 Professional fees decreased 2.2 million or 48.9 to 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of additional professional fees incurred during the first quarter of 2023 as a result of the completion of the 2023-1 securitization transaction, as the 2023-1 securitization debt is carried at fair value the associated debt issuance costs were expensed as incurred. As the 2024-1 
 68 

Table of Contents 

securitization debt is carried at amortized costs, the associated debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the debt. 
 
 Impairment charges 
 
 Impairment charges increased 5.2 million related to impairment of capitalized internal-use software that no longer has a planned future use of 2.7 million as well as lease impairment charges of 2.4 million. 
 
 Other expenses 
 
 Other expenses increased 1.6 million or 27.7 to 7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a loss on the repurchase of the non-investment grade securities related to the 2022-2 securitization transaction, a decrease in deferred acquisition costs as a result of accounting for the origination of all new finance receivables at fair value, with acquisition costs being expensed in the period incurred rather than deferred, and an increase in dealer equity program expense. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA loss increased 13.1 million to 27.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the 6.6 million decrease in net interest income after losses and recoveries and the 8.0 million increase in expenses after EBITDA adjustments, including compensation and benefits, professional fees, impairment charges, and other expenses, as discussed above.

 Warranties and GAP loss, net, increased 8.2 million to 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a revised estimate of proceeds we expect to recover. 
 
 Gain on debt extinguishment 
 
 Gain on debt extinguishment represents a gain of 19.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to the repurchase of 32.8 million in aggregate principal balance of the Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, for 13.2 million.

 Other income decreased 3.8 million or 71.3 to 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by lower cash and cash equivalent balances and lower interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalents.

 Compensation and benefits expense increased 2.3 million or 31.8 to 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of severance

expense related to the departure of certain executives and retention bonuses granted to retain key employees subsequent to the Ecommerce Wind-Down. 
 
 Professional fees 
 
 Professional fees decreased 2.1 million or 34.9 to 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of reduced audit, legal, and consulting fees as a result of the reduced size of the business. 
 
 Software and IT costs 
 
 Software and IT costs decreased 2.0 million or 34.4 to 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of more efficient targeted software use as well as renegotiating and right-sizing our Software and IT contracts. 
 
 Other expenses 
 
 Other expenses decreased 2.3 million or 31.2 to 5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to a decrease in public company related insurance costs as we renegotiated our insurance policies during the third quarter of 2023 and 2024 as a result of the reduced scale of the business. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 51.1 million and restricted cash of 47.1 million. Restricted cash primarily includes restricted cash required under UACC's securitization transactions and Warehouse Credit Facilities of 46.2 million. Prior to the Ecommerce Wind-Down, our primary source of liquidity was cash generated through financing activities. Additionally, we had excess borrowing capacity of 32.9 million under UACC's Warehouse Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 As a result of the liquidation of our vehicle inventory as part of the Ecommerce Wind-Down, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the 2022 Vehicle Floorplan Facility in full and the agreement has been terminated. 
 
 We expect to use our cash and cash equivalents to finance our future capital requirements and UACC s Warehouse Credit Facilities to fund our finance receivables. Certain advance rates available to UACC on borrowings from the Warehouse Credit Facilities have decreased as a result of the increased credit losses in UACC's portfolio and overall rising interest rates. Any future decreases on available advance rates may have an adverse impact on our liquidity. 
 
 UACC relies on borrowings under senior secured warehouse credit facilities to finance the origination of finance receivables as well as to provide funding for general operating activities. The terms of those facilities generally mature within two years and we typically renew those facilities in the ordinary course. UACC currently has four Warehouse Credit Facilities, all of which have terms expiring between June and September 2025. See Note 9, Warehouse Credit Facilities and Consolidated VIEs, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We have commenced discussions with our lenders under the Warehouse Credit Facilities regarding amended facilities that would extend the terms beyond the current expiration dates and, consistent with prior periods, expect those facilities to be amended and renewed. However, there can be no assurance that adequate additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to secure warehouse borrowing capacity beyond the expiration of the current facilities in 2025 would have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance UACC s lending operations and our results of operations and liquidity. 
 
 If we undergo a fundamental change under the terms of our Indenture, holders of the Notes could, subject to certain conditions, require us to immediately repurchase for cash all or any portion of the Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The delisting of the Company s common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market would constitute a fundamental change under the terms of an indenture between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Indenture"). 
 
 Nasdaq maintains several standards for continued listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet such standards and maintain our listing. For example, 
 71 

Table of Contents 

under the equity standard , the Company is required to have stockholders equity of at least 10 million, among other requirements. Under the total asset standard , the market value of the Company's publicly held shares must be at least 15 million, among other requirements. Only one standard has to be met to comply with Nasdaq requirements. We currently meet the "total asset standard", however, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so, or that we will be able to satisfy any other standard. If we are not able to satisfy a continued listing requirement from Nasdaq and our common stock is delisted, we will be required to repurchase the Notes prior to maturity, as discussed above. Moreover, we may be delisted by Nasdaq due the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, and we may be unable to relist on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, and as of the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we do not have sufficient liquidity to repurchase the Notes in the event of a fundamental change and would be required to seek financing. Such financing may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. 
 
 On November 12, 2024, we announced our entry into the RSA and our intention to commence the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. The RSA contemplates and the Plan proposes that, upon effectiveness, each holder of an Allowed Unsecured Notes Claim (as defined therein) will receive, in full and final satisfaction, settlement, discharge and release of, and in exchange for, its Allowed Unsecured Notes Claim, its pro rata share of 92.94 of the New Common Stock (subject to dilution by the New Warrants, the MIP, and the Post-Effective Date Equity Awards, all terms as defined therein). One of the intended goals of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case is for stockholders to retain value in our business, and to restore confidence in the long-term sustainability of our operating segments. On the effective date of the Plan, all notes, instruments, certificates, and other documents evidencing Unsecured Notes Claims will be canceled and/or updated to record such cancellation and the obligations of the Debtor thereunder or in any way related thereto will be deemed satisfied in full and discharged. 
 
 The filing of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case will trigger an event of default, resulting in the immediate acceleration of the Company's obligations to pay principal and interest under the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, as a result of the filing such as the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, the principal, premium, if any, accrued and unpaid interest and any other monetary obligations due thereunder will be immediately due and payable. However, any enforcement of such payment obligations will be stayed as a result of the filing of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case and subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Plan contemplates the termination of the Indenture. 
 
 As discussed herein, the consummation of the Plan is subject to numerous conditions and the Plan may not be consummated, including if the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case is not commenced for any reason. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the transactions described herein will be consummated on the expected terms, if at all. Refer to Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for further discussion. 
 
 While we continue to meet our obligations to customers, vendors, counterparties and employees in the ordinary course of business, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. While the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, these uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon our plans, which include, among other things, our ability to, subject to the approval by the Bankruptcy Court, implement a comprehensive restructuring and successfully emerge from the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared on the basis that we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates that we will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for twelve months following the issuance date. 
 
 Despite the anticipated Chapter 11 filing, the Company retains sufficient liquidity, with approximately 51.1 million of unrestricted cash on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, and it continues to meet its obligations to customers, vendors, counterparties and employees in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 Convertible Senior Notes 
 
 On June 18, 2021, we issued 625.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes pursuant to the Indenture. 
 
 72 

Table of Contents 

The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.75 per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2022. The Notes will mature on July 1, 2026, subject to earlier repurchase, redemption or conversion. The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting commissions paid to the initial purchasers and debt issuance costs, were approximately 608.9 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert were not met. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 287.9 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes remain outstanding, net of deferred issuance costs of 2.6 million. Refer to Note 10 Long Term Debt of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for further discussion. 
 
 Securitization Transactions 
 
 Subject to market conditions, we plan to sell finance receivables originated by UACC through asset-backed securitization transactions. During the second quarter of 2024, UACC completed the 2024-1 securitization transaction, in which it sold approximately 300.0 million of rated asset-backed securities in an auto finance receivable securitization transaction from a securitization trust, established and sponsored by UACC for proceeds of 297.2 million. The trust is collateralized by finance receivables with an aggregate principal balance of 380.1 million as of April 30, 2024. These finance receivables are serviced by UACC. As a result of market conditions, UACC retained the residual interests, which required us to account for the 2024-1 securitization as secured borrowings and remain on balance sheet pending the sale of such retained interests. We also repurchased 4.2 million of the non-investment grade securities related to the 2022-2 securitization transaction for 4.8 million. 
 
 In 2023, UACC sold investment and non-investment grade rated asset-backed securities in the 2023-1 securitization transaction for proceeds of 260.9 million. The securitization trust is collateralized by finance receivables with an aggregate principal balance of 326.4 million as of January 31, 2023. As a result of market conditions at the time, which led to unfavorable pricing, UACC retained the residual interests, and we accounted for the 2023-1 securitization transaction as secured borrowings. 
 
 Finance receivables are serviced by UACC. UACC retains at least 5 of the notes and residual certificates sold as required by applicable risk retention rules and generally uses the proceeds of the securitization transactions to pay down outstanding debt under its Warehouse Credit Facilities. 
 
 As a result of high interest rates, the current inflationary environment and vehicle depreciation in the used automotive industry, UACC is experiencing higher loss severity. The increased loss severity could lead to reduced servicing income if UACC elects to waive monthly servicing fees going forward as it did in the first quarter of 2023. The waiver of monthly servicing fees related to the 2022-2 securitization transaction resulted in consolidation of the related finance receivables and securitization debt on our financial statements. 
 
 Refer to Note 4 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for further discussion. 
 
 UACC Risk Retention Financing Facility 
 
 On May 3, 2023, UACC entered into a Risk Retention Financing Facility enabling it to finance a portion of the asset-backed securities issued in its securitization transactions and held by UACC pursuant to applicable risk retention rules. Under this facility, UACC sells such retained interests and agrees to repurchase them at fair value on a future date. In its initial transaction under this facility, UACC pledged 24.5 million of its retained beneficial interests as collateral, and received proceeds of 24.1 million, with expected repurchase dates ranging from March 2025 to September 2029. The securitization trusts will distribute payments related to UACC's pledged beneficial interests in securitizations directly to the lenders, which will reduce the beneficial interests in securitizations and the related debt balance . 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, UACC pledged an additional 15.8 million of its retained beneficial interest in the 2024-1 securitization transaction as collateral under the Risk Retention Financing Facility, and received proceeds of 15.6 million, with expected repurchase dates ranging from August 2026 to November 2030 at the initial closing date.

Warehouse Credit Facilities 
 
 UACC has four senior secured warehouse credit facility agreements the Warehouse Credit Facilities with banking institutions. The Warehouse Credit Facilities are collateralized by eligible finance receivables and available borrowings are computed based on a percentage of eligible finance receivables. 
 
 The aggregate borrowing limit is 825.0 million with maturities between June 2025 and September 2025. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings related to the Warehouse Credit Facilities were 321.8 million and we were in compliance with all covenants under the terms of the Warehouse Credit Facilities. Failure to satisfy these and or any other requirements contained within the agreements would restrict access to the Warehouse Credit Facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Certain breaches of covenants may also result in acceleration of the repayment of borrowings prior to the scheduled maturity. Refer to Note 9 Warehouse Credit Facilities of Consolidated VIEs to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for further discussion. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities

Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flows used in operating activities from continuing operations decreased by 202.6 million, from 356.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 154.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a 97.8 million decrease in originations of finance receivables held for sale, as a result of no longer originating loans for legacy Vroom customers, an increase in principal payments received on finance receivables held for sale of 62.0 million, a 31.1 million improvement in net loss from continuing operations after reconciling adjustments, and changes in working capital of 9.8 million. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows provided by investing activities from continuing operations decreased by 55.0 million, from 147.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 92.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily due to a 44.4 million decrease in principal payments received on finance receivables at fair value as well as the consolidation of the 2022-2 securitization transaction which resulted in a cash inflow of 11.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows provided by financing activities from continuing operations decreased 162.3 million, from 169.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily related to a 162.5 million decrease in net cashflows related to our Warehouse Credit Facilities, as a result of less borrowings and higher repayments following the 2024-1 securitization transaction and a 12.9 million decrease in net cashflows from financing of beneficial interests in securitizations. These decreases were partially offset by 13.2 million in repurchases of the Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, among others, those related to finance receivables, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies, warranties and GAP income-related reserves, fair value measurements and useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience, market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
 The critical accounting policies that reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements include those described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 Revenue Recognition to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Except as described below, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Fair Value of Finance Receivables 
 
 The valuation of finance receivables at fair value is derived from an internally developed model that estimates the present value of future cash flows. We estimate the present value of these future cash flows using a valuation model consisting of internally developed estimates that rely on unobservable assumptions third-party market participants would use in determining fair value, including prepayment speed, default rate, recovery rate, and discount rates. All these assumptions are primarily based on historical performance. These valuation models are calculated by combining similarly priced loans and vintages to determine a stream of expected cash flows which are then discounted. The individual discounted pools of cash flows are then aggregated to determine the total expected discounted cash flows on the outstanding receivable at a given measurement period. 
 
 The estimates for the aforementioned assumptions significantly affect the reported amount (and changes thereon) of our finance receivables at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Item 3. Quan titative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item 3. 
 
 Item 4. Con trols and Procedures 
 
 Limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures 
 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - O THER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Leg al Proceedings 
 
 On November 12, 2024, we entered into the RSA with creditors holding, in the aggregate, over 80 of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes. The RSA contemplates a Plan to be implemented through the anticipated filing of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. The Plan is attached as an exhibit to the RSA. In connection with the restructuring, the ordinary course operations of Vroom, Inc. s subsidiaries are expected to continue without impact, and trade creditors and all other general unsecured creditors are expected to be unimpaired. If the Plan is consummated, we will emerge without any remaining Notes but will maintain UACC s Warehouse Credit Facilities (as defined below), securitization debt, financing of beneficial interest in securitizations, and junior subordinated debentures. 
 
 We (in the context of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, the Debtor are expected to commence a voluntary proceeding (the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court ). We plan to continue to operate its business as a debtor-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtor plans to seek approval of certain first day motions containing customary relief intended to assure the Debtor s ability to continue its ordinary course operations. 
 
 While certain prepetition litigation claims will be treated as unimpaired 510(b) Claims (as defined in the Plan) during the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, the Company is involved in certain other litigation, which, so long as it remains unresolved, represents legal issues of uncertain outcome and potential claims for monetary damages. If the outcomes of such litigation are unfavorable, they could have a material impact on the Company s operations and financial health. 
 
 Additionally, there is a risk of future litigation. In general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against. Such litigation could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect the reorganized company s financial results. It is also possible that certain parties will commence litigation with respect to the treatment of their claims and interests under the Plan. It is not possible to predict with certainty what, if any, future litigation the reorganized company may become involved in, nor the final resolution of such litigation. The impact of any such litigation on the reorganized company s businesses and financial stability, however, could be material. 
 
 Additionally, from time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings in the normal course of operating our business. The outcome of litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Beginning in March 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by certain of the Company s stockholders against the Company and certain of the Company s officers alleging violations of federal securities laws. The lawsuits were captioned Zawatsky et al. v. Vroom, Inc. et al., Case No. 21-cv-2477; Holbrook v. Vroom, Inc. et al., Case No. 21-cv-2551; and Hudda v. Vroom, Inc. et al., Case No. 21-cv-3296. All three of the lawsuits asserted similar claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5. In each case, the named plaintiff(s) sought to represent a proposed class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company s securities during a period from June 9, 2020 to March 3, 2021 (in the case of Holbrook and Hudda), or November 11, 2020 to March 3, 2021 (in the case of Zawatsky). In August 2021, the Court consolidated the cases under the new name In re: Vroom, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case No. 21-cv-2477, appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel and ordered a consolidated amended complaint to be filed. The court-appointed lead plaintiff subsequently filed a consolidated amended complaint that reasserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5 against the Company and certain of the Company s officers, and added new claims under Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act against the Company, certain of its officers, certain of its directors, and the underwriters of the Company s September 2020 secondary offering. The Company filed a motion to dismiss all claims, and briefing of this motion is complete. The Company believes this lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously contest these claims. While the outcome of any complex legal proceeding is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. 
 
 In August 2021, November 2021, January 2022, and February 2022, various Company stockholders filed purported shareholder derivative lawsuits on behalf of the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain of the Company s officers and directors, and nominally against the Company, alleging violations of the federal securities laws and breaches of fiduciary duty to the Company and/or related violations of Delaware law based on the same general course of conduct alleged in In re: Vroom, Inc. Securities Litigation. All four lawsuits have 
 77 

Table of Contents 

been consolidated under the case caption In re Vroom, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation, Case No. 21-cv-6933, and the court has approved the parties stipulation that the cases would remain stayed pending final resolution of In re: Vroom, Inc. Securities Litigation. All four derivative suits remain in preliminary stages and there have been no substantive developments in any matter. 
 
 In April 2022 and April 2024, two of the Company s stockholders filed separate purported shareholder derivative lawsuits on behalf of the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against certain of the Company s officers and directors, and nominally against the Company, alleging violations of the federal securities law and breaches of fiduciary duty to the Company and/or related violations of Delaware law based on the same general course of conduct alleged in In re: Vroom, Inc. Securities Litigation. The case filed in April 2022 is captioned Godlu v. Hennessy et al., Case No. 22-cv-569, the case filed in April 2024 is captioned Hudda v. Hennessy et al. Case No. 24-cv-4499., and the court in each has approved the parties stipulations that each case would remain stayed pending final resolution of In re: Vroom, Inc. Securities Litigation. Both lawsuits remain in preliminary stages and there have been no substantive developments. 
 
 In January 2022, the Company received a non-public civil investigative demand from the Federal Trade Commission FTC ), seeking the production of information related to certain of the Company's business practices and the Company responded to those information requests. On February 23, 2024, the FTC notified the Company that it has reason to believe that the Company violated Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(a); the FTC's Mail, Internet, or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule, 16 C.F.R. Part 435; the FTC s Used Motor Vehicle Trade Regulation Rule, 16 C.F.R. Part 455; and the FTC s Pre-Sale Availability Rule, 16 C.F.R. Part 702. On May 6, 2024, Vroom, Inc., Vroom Automotive, LLC and the FTC reached an agreement to resolve the FTC s allegations without any admission of wrongdoing by either Vroom entity, subject to final approval by the FTC and the court. Under the agreement, the Company agreed to pay a total of 1 million in customer redress and abide permanently by an injunction. The FTC issued its final approval of the agreement on July 2, 2024, and a mutually-agreed upon order reflecting the agreement was entered by the Court on July 10, 2024. The case is captioned Federal Trade Commission v. Vroom, Inc. et al., Case No. 4:24-cv-02496. 
 
 In April 2022, the Attorney General of Texas filed a petition on behalf of the State of Texas in the District Court of Travis County, Texas against the Company, alleging violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Consumer Protection Act, Texas Business and Commerce Code 17.41 et seq., based on alleged deficiencies and other issues in the Company s marketing of used vehicles and fulfilment of customer orders, including the titling and registration of sold vehicles. According to the petition, 80 of the customer complaints referenced in the petition were received in the 12 months prior to April 2022. The petition is captioned State of Texas v. Vroom Automotive LLC, and Vroom Inc., Case No. D-1-GN-001809. In May 2022, Vroom Automotive, LLC and the Attorney General of the State of Texas agreed to a temporary injunction in which Vroom Automotive, LLC agreed to adhere to its existing practice of possessing title for all vehicles it sells or advertises as available for sale on its ecommerce platform. In December 2023, Vroom, Inc., Vroom Automotive, LLC and the Attorney General of the State of Texas reached a final agreement to resolve all claims in the petition, without any admission of wrongdoing by either Vroom entity. Under the agreement, the Company agreed to pay a total of 2 million in civil penalties and 1 million in attorneys' fees, with the first half due in September 2024 and the remaining half due in September 2025, and abide permanently by an injunction of certain operational practices that were previously implemented. 
 
 As previously disclosed, we have been subject to audits, requests for information, investigations and other inquiries from our regulators. These regulatory matters could continue to progress into legal proceedings as well as enforcement actions. We have incurred fines in certain states and could continue to incur fines, penalties, restitution, or alterations in our business practices, which in turn, could lead to increased business expenses, additional limitations on our business activities and further reputational damage, although to date such expenses have not had a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those disclosed under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report. We provide below the material changes to our risk factors described in our Annual Report . If any of these risks or others not specified materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock:

Table of Contents 

We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. 
 
 We have entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the RSA and expect to commence a voluntary proceeding as the Debtor under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court (the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case ). The RSA contemplates a comprehensive restructuring of the Company s debt obligations and capital structure to be implemented through a prepackaged plan of reorganization (the Plan to be implemented through the anticipated filing of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. We plan to continue to operate our business as a debtor-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. We anticipate seeking approval of certain first day motions containing customary relief intended to assure our ability to continue our ordinary course operations. None of Vroom, Inc. s subsidiaries are expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings. 
 
 The anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Our senior management has spent, and so long as the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case continues, they will continue to be required to spend, a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing on our business operations. Bankruptcy Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and the key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. Furthermore, we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. In addition, during the period of time we may remain subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code in the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, our customers and vendors may lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships. 
 
 Other significant risks include or relate to the following: 
 
 our ability to obtain the Bankruptcy Court s approval with respect to motions or other requests made to the Bankruptcy Court in the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, including maintaining strategic control as a debtor-in-possession; 

the effects of the filing of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case on our business and the interest of various constituents, including our stockholders; 

the high costs of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case and related fees; 

our ability to maintain relationships with vendors, customers, employees and other third parties as a result of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case; 

Bankruptcy Court rulings in the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case as well as the outcome of all other pending litigation and the outcome of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case in general; 

the length of time that we anticipate we will operate with Chapter 11 protection, if at all, and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of the proceeding; 

third-party motions in the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case; 

potential delisting by Nasdaq due to the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case; 

our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case; and 

the potential adverse effects of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case on our liquidity and results of operations. 

Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, we may not be able to accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, nor can we accurately predict the ultimate impact the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case may have on our corporate or capital structure. If the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case is not successful, any other strategic options that we pursue to address the impact of the 
 79 

Table of Contents 

Company's outstanding Notes, including any recapitalization, restructuring, reorganization, bankruptcy, or liquidation, may not be successful and holders of our common stock could be diluted or suffer a total loss of their investment. 
 
 We may not be able to obtain confirmation of the Plan as outlined in the RSA. 
 
 There can be no assurance that the Plan as outlined in the RSA (or any other plan of reorganization) will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court, so we urge caution with respect to existing and future investments in our securities. 
 
 The success of any reorganization will depend on approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the willingness of existing debt and security holders to agree to the treatment as outlined in the Plan, and there can be no guarantee of success with respect to the Plan or any other plan of reorganization. We might receive objections to confirmation of the Plan from the various stakeholders in the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. We cannot predict the impact that any objection might have on the Plan or on a Bankruptcy Court's decision to confirm the Plan. Any objection may cause us to devote significant resources in response that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, it is possible that an official committee of equityholders is appointed, which could materially impact the length and cost of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, or, the ability to consummate the Plan as contemplated in the RSA. 
 
 If the Plan is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if any, distributions holders of claims against us, including holders of our unsecured debt and equity, as well as holders of the Notes, would ultimately receive with respect to their claims. There can be no assurance as to whether we will successfully reorganize and emerge from Chapter 11 or, if we do successfully reorganize, as to when we would emerge from Chapter 11. If no plan of reorganization can be confirmed, or if the Bankruptcy Court otherwise finds that it would be in the best interest of holders of claims and interests, the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which a trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. 
 
 If the RSA is terminated, our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 The RSA contains a number of termination events, upon the occurrence of which certain parties to the RSA may terminate the agreement. If the RSA is terminated as to all parties thereto, each of the parties will be released from its obligations in accordance with the terms of the RSA. Such termination may result in the loss of support for the Plan by the parties to the RSA, which could adversely affect our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan. If the Plan is not consummated, there can be no assurance that any new plan would be as favorable to holders of claims against the Company as contemplated by the RSA. 
 
 The RSA is subject to significant conditions and milestones that may be difficult for us to satisfy. 
 
 There are certain material conditions we must satisfy under the proposed RSA, including the timely satisfaction of milestones for the progress of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, including, among other things, to obtain certain bankruptcy court orders and complete the Plan. Our ability to timely complete such milestones is subject to risks and uncertainties that may be beyond our control. 
 
 Trading in our securities is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. If the Plan becomes effective, the holders of our existing common stock will be diluted. 
 
 The RSA contemplates the Plan to be implemented through the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. The Plan is attached as an exhibit to the RSA. In connection with the restructuring, trade creditors and all other general unsecured creditors will be unimpaired. The Plan, as contemplated in the proposed RSA, provides that upon the Company's emergence from Chapter 11, noteholders will receive, among other things, their pro rata share of 92.94 of the common stock in the reorganized company and that the holders of the existing common stock of the Company will receive their pro rata share of 7.06 of the common stock in the reorganized Company and their pro rata share of the new warrants exercisable upon the Company reaching certain benchmarks pursuant to the terms of the proposed new warrants. In addition, if the Plan as contemplated in the proposed RSA is consummated, 15 of the Fully-Diluted New Common Stock outstanding as of immediately following the Plan Effective Date will be reserved for issuance as awards under a post-restructuring management incentive plan consisting of 10 restricted stock units and 5 options. Issuances of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) under the Plan, the Post-Effective Date Equity Awards or management incentive plan and any exercises of the warrants or conversion rights for shares of 
 80 

Table of Contents 

common stock will dilute the voting power of the outstanding common stock and may adversely affect the trading price of such common stock. 
 
 Following the effectiveness of the Plan, certain holders of Unsecured Notes Claims, if they choose to act together, will have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders of the reorganized company for approval. 
 
 Certain Holders of Unsecured Notes Claims are expected to acquire a significant ownership interest in the New Common Stock pursuant to the Plan. Such Holders may be in a position to control the outcome of all actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, without the approval of other stockholders. This concentration of ownership could also facilitate or hinder a negotiated change of control of the Reorganized Debtor and, consequently, have an impact upon the value of the New Common Stock. The significant ownership stake may allow these Holders to appoint a majority of the board of directors, potentially influencing the company's management and strategic direction. This could lead to changes in corporate governance practices, business strategies, and capital allocation policies that align with the interests of the major shareholders. The concentrated ownership might also affect the liquidity of the New Common Stock in the market, potentially impacting its trading price and volatility. The interests of these significant Holders may not always align with those of other shareholders or the Reorganized Debtor, potentially leading to conflicts in decision-making. Lastly, this ownership structure could either attract potential acquirers due to the ease of negotiating with a small group of major shareholders or deter them if the Holders are not interested in selling their stakes. Notably, a single party alone would likely hold sufficient voting power to control stockholder approval on most matters, potentially marginalizing minority shareholders. 
 
 Our business could suffer from a long and protracted restructuring. 
 
 While only Vroom, Inc. is anticipated to be a debtor in the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case and its subsidiaries will not be subject to the Bankruptcy Code, our future results are dependent upon the timely implementation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. A long period of operations under Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and suppliers, customers and other counterparties may not want to do business with us while we are in bankruptcy. Failure to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan in a timely manner may harm our ability to finance adequately our operations, and there is a significant risk that the value of the Company would be substantially eroded to the detriment of all stakeholders. If a Chapter 11 plan that complies with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code cannot be confirmed, we would have to pursue other strategic options to address the impact of the outstanding Notes. Any other strategic option that we pursue, including any recapitalization, restructuring, reorganization, bankruptcy, or liquidation, may not be successful and holders of our common stock could be diluted or suffer a total loss of their investment. 
 
 For as long as the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case continues, we will be required to incur substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. If we are unable to continue to fund our operations, our chances of successfully reorganizing our business may be seriously jeopardized, the likelihood that we instead will be required to liquidate our assets may be enhanced, and, as a result, our common stock could become further devalued or become worthless. 
 
 There can be no assurance of whether, or when, we will be able to successfully implement a Chapter 11 plan, or whether we will be able to do so in a timely fashion. 
 
 Even if a Chapter 11 plan is confirmed and implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders, suppliers and other counterparties to do business with a company that recently emerged from bankruptcy proceedings. 
 
 As a result of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, our historical financial information will not be indicative of our future performance. 
 
 During the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile. Further, we anticipate that our capital structure will be significantly altered if and when we are able to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the filing of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. In addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to our historical consolidated financial statements. We also may be required to adopt fresh start accounting, in which case our 
 81 

Table of Contents 

assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting may be different from historical trends. 
 
 We are subject to claims that will not be discharged in the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 While certain prepetition litigation claims will be treated as unimpaired 510(b) Claims (as defined in the Plan) during the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, the Company is involved in certain other litigation, which, so long as it remains unresolved, represents legal issues of uncertain outcome and potential claims for monetary damages. If the outcomes of such litigation are unfavorable, they could have a material impact on the Company s operations and financial health. 
 
 Additionally, there is a risk of future litigation. In general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against. Such litigation could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect the reorganized company s financial results. It is also possible that certain parties will commence litigation with respect to the treatment of their claims and interests under the Plan. It is not possible to predict with certainty what, if any, future litigation the reorganized company may become involved in, nor the final resolution of such litigation. The impact of any such litigation on the reorganized company s businesses and financial stability, however, could be material. 
 
 The anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case will consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. 
 
 Management has spent a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the entry into the RSA and the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, and while the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case continues, our management will be required to continue to spend a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of our business, and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case is protracted. 
 
 Furthermore, during the pendency of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, we may experience increased levels of employee attrition, and our employees may face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, the longer the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case continues, the more likely it is that vendors and employees will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully. 
 
 Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our Board of Directors may change. 
 
 Under the Plan, the composition of our Board may change. Any new directors are likely to have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the Board and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine our future. As a result, our future strategy and plans may differ materially from those of the past. 
 
 The anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case raises substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 As a result of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, our operations and ability to develop and execute our business plan are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other things, our ability to, subject to the approval by the Bankruptcy Court, implement a comprehensive restructuring, successfully emerge from the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case and maintain sufficient liquidity following the restructuring to meet our obligations and operating needs. The Plan contemplated by the RSA could fail to be confirmed or become effective, or the Bankruptcy Court may grant or deny motions in a manner that is adverse to us 
 82 

Table of Contents 

and our subsidiaries. Accordingly, the transactions described herein may not be consummated on the expected terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Our common stock price may be volatile, and the value of our common stock has declined since our initial public offering and may continue to decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price which you paid for them. 
 
 It is possible that an active trading market for shares of our common stock will not be sustained, which could make it difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock at an attractive price or at all. 
 
 Many factors, some of which are outside our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including those described in this Risk Factors section and the "Risk Factors" section in our Annual Report, as well as the following: 
 the anticipated filing and outcome of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, including as a result of the Plan that the RSA contemplates; 

our operating and financial performance and prospects, including as a result of operational changes and initiatives we are taking as part of our Value Maximization Plan; 

the discontinuation of our ecommerce operations and wind-down of our used vehicle dealership business and our ability to reduce the related costs; 

potential delisting of our common stock; 

our ability to grow and develop the UACC and CarStory businesses; 

our liquidity and ability to raise or restructure our existing capital; 

our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations; 

our guidance regarding future quarterly or annual earnings, and our financial results in relation to previously issued guidance; 

our ability to achieve the benefits of any cost saving measures; 

future announcements concerning our businesses or our competitors businesses; 

the public s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC; 

coverage by or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations; market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our business strategy; 

changes in market sentiment regarding growth companies that are not yet profitable; 

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; 

changes in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us; 

changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; 

changes in senior management or key personnel and the impact of reductions in our workforce; 

issuances, exchanges or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges or sales of our capital stock; 

changes in our dividend policy; 

new, or adverse resolution of pending, litigation or other claims against us; 

global political unrest and wars, including geopolitical conflicts and war in Europe and the Middle East, which could delay and disrupt our business, and if such political unrest further escalates or leads to disruptions in the financial markets or puts further pressure on global supply chains, it could heighten many of the other risk factors included in this Item 1A and the other risk factors included in the section titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023; 

the current inflationary environment in the United States and in other global economies, the impact of high interest rates and the impact of any recession or general economic downturn; 

83 

Table of Contents 

potential volatility in the banking industry; and 

other changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from the federal government s ongoing negotiations regarding the federal debt limit, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, global pandemics, and responses to such events. 

As a result, volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their common stock at or above the price which they paid for them. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. 
 
 We have experienced significant declines in the market price of our common stock, and it could continue to decline in the future, including as a result of the execution and implementation of our Value Maximization Plan or the filing and implementation of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. Accordingly, any trading in our common stock during the pendency of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case will be highly speculative and pose substantial risks to purchasers of our common stock. 
 
 Further declines in our stock price could, among other things, make it more difficult to raise or restructure capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and make it difficult for our investors to sell their shares of common stock. In addition, companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities often are the subject of securities class action litigation. For example, a consolidated class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against us, certain of our officers, and certain of our directors, among others, alleging violations of the federal securities laws. See Part II, Item 1 Legal Proceedings. 
 
 Our indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our debt obligations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we, including our subsidiaries, had approximately 1,051.2 million principal amount of consolidated indebtedness. Of that amount, 410.0 million of securitization debt is funded by cashflows on receivables within the securitization trusts. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things: 
 increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; 

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; 

requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes, including the successful execution of our Value Maximization Plan; 

limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business; and 

placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital. 

Our business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, or to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, our existing indebtedness contains, and any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. 
 
 For example, on December 21, 2023, we received written notice from Nasdaq notifying us that, for the prior 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. On February 13, 2024, after obtaining stockholder approval, we effected a 1-for-80 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split ), and our stock began trading on a post-split adjusted basis on February 14, 2024. On February 29, 2024, we were notified by Nasdaq Listing Qualifications that the closing bid price of our common stock had been at 1.00 per share or greater for 11 consecutive 
 84 

Table of Contents 

business days, from February 14, 2024 to February 28, 2024. Accordingly, the Company has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) and this matter is now closed. However, if our common stock again closes below the 1.00 per share minimum bid price required by Nasdaq for 30 consecutive business days, we again would receive another notice of non-compliance with Nasdaq s listing standards and would face the risk of delisting. There can be no assurance that our common stock will continue to close at or above the 1.00 per share minimum bid price as required by Nasdaq, or that we will meet the other requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing on Nasdaq Global Select Market. 
 
 For example, under the "equity standard", applicable Nasdaq listing standards currently require us to have stockholders equity of at least 10 million, among other requirements. Under the "total asset standard", the market value of our publicly held shares must be at least 15 million, among other requirements. Only one standard has to be met to comply with Nasdaq requirements. While we currently meet the "total asset standard", there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so, or that we will be able to satisfy any other standard. A delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market would constitute a fundamental change under the terms of our Indenture and holders of the Notes could, subject to certain conditions, require us to immediately repurchase for cash all or any portion of the Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest. As of September 30, 2024, and as of the date of issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements, we do not have sufficient liquidity to repurchase the Notes in the event of a fundamental change and would be required to seek financing. Such financing may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, if we fail to comply with the terms of our Indenture or to service the interest under the Notes and repay the Notes as and when they become due, that could in turn also result in our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. Our ability to maintain our indebtedness, including to service the interest under the Notes and repay the Notes, as and when they become due, will depend on our ability to generate and maintain sufficient cash, and if necessary, raise additional capital. On November 12, 2024, we announced our entry into the RSA and intention to commence the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. The RSA contemplates and the Plan proposes that, upon effectiveness, each holder of an Allowed Unsecured Notes Claim (as defined therein) will receive, in full and final satisfaction, settlement, discharge and release of, and in exchange for, its Allowed Unsecured Notes Claim, its pro rata share of 92.94 of the New Common Stock (subject to dilution by the New Warrants, the MIP, and the Post-Effective Date Equity Awards, all terms as defined therein). On the effective date of the Plan, all notes, instruments, certificates, and other documents evidencing Unsecured Notes Claims will be canceled and/or updated to record such cancellation and the obligations of the Debtor thereunder or in any way related thereto will be deemed satisfied in full and discharged. While the filing of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case will constitute an event of default that will accelerate the Company s respective obligations under the Indenture, the Plan contemplates the termination of the Indenture. As discussed herein, the consummation of the Plan is subject to numerous conditions and the Plan may not be consummated, including if the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case is not commenced for any reason. 
 
 We may be unable to satisfy a continued listing rule from Nasdaq, and if we are delisted, there is no assurance we will be able to satisfy an initial listing rule from Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. 
 Nasdaq maintains several requirements for continued listing of our common stock, one of which is the maintenance of a minimum closing bid price of 1.00. On December 21, 2023, we received written notice from Nasdaq notifying us that, for the prior 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. On February 13, 2024, after obtaining stockholder approval, we effected a 1-for-80 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split ), and our stock began trading on a post-split adjusted basis on February 14, 2024. On February 29, 2024, we were notified by Nasdaq Listing Qualifications that the closing bid price of our common stock had been at 1.00 per share or greater for 11 consecutive business days, from February 14, 2024 to February 28, 2024. Accordingly, the Company regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) and this matter is now closed. However, if our common stock again closes below the 1.00 per share minimum bid price required by Nasdaq for 30 consecutive business days, we would receive another notice of non-compliance with Nasdaq's listing standards and may be provided a period of 180 calendar days from the date of such notice to regain compliance with the minimum bid closing price requirement of at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. However, there can be no assurance that our common stock will continue to close at or above the 1.00 per share minimum bid price as required by Nasdaq. We intend to continue to actively monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and, if we lose compliance with Nasdaq s minimum bid price closing requirements, will consider all available options to regain compliance. 
 There can also be no assurance that we will meet the other requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. For example, under the "equity standard", applicable Nasdaq listing standards currently require us to have stockholders equity of at least 10 million, among other requirements. Under the "total asset standard", the market value of our publicly held shares must be at least 15 million, among other requirements. Only one standard 
 85 

Table of Contents 

has to be met to comply with Nasdaq requirements. While we currently meet the "total asset standard", there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so, or that we will be able to satisfy any other standard. A delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market would constitute a fundamental change under the terms of our Indenture and holders of the Notes could, subject to certain conditions, require us to immediately repurchase for cash all or any portion of the Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest. As of September 30, 2024, and as of the date of issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to repurchase the Notes in the event of a fundamental change and would be required to seek financing. Such financing may not be available to the Company on favorable terms, or at all. 
 The Company may be delisted by Nasdaq due the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. If our common stock is delisted based on the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, the bid price closing requirement, the stockholders equity requirement, or any other continued listing requirement, it is unlikely that we will be able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange and, as a result, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations and analyst coverage for our common stock, and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities. 
 Delisting also could result in, among other things, a loss of investor confidence or interest in strategic transactions or opportunities, us being subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities, and difficulty in recruiting and retaining personnel through equity incentive awards. 
 Our tax attributes and future tax deductions may be reduced or significantly limited as a result of the consummation of the Plan and any restructuring or reorganization in connection therewith. 
 Generally, any discharge of our debt obligations as a result of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case for an amount less than the adjusted issue price may give rise to cancellation of indebtedness income, which will reduce our tax attributes. 
 
 Certain tax attributes otherwise available and of value to us may be reduced, in most cases by the principal amount of the indebtedness forgiven. U.S. federal income tax attributes subject to reduction generally include (i) net operating losses NOL(s) and NOL carryforwards; (ii) general business credit carryovers; (iii) minimum tax credit carryovers; (iv) capital loss carryovers; (v) tax basis in assets (but not below the amount of liabilities to which the taxpayer remains subject immediately after the indebtedness forgiven); (vi) passive activity loss and credit carryovers; and (vii) foreign tax credit carryovers. Loss of these tax attributes may have an adverse effect on our prospective cash flow. 
 
 To the extent that U.S. federal NOL carryforwards, other losses and credits generated by us prior to emergence from bankruptcy are available as deductions after emergence, our ability to utilize such deductions may be limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). Section 382 of the Code provides rules limiting the utilization of a corporation s NOLs and other losses, deductions and credits following a more than 50 change in ownership of a corporation s equity over a three-year period (an ownership change ). An exception to the limitations under Section 382 of the Code generally applies when, among other requirements, so-called qualified creditors and shareholders of a corporation in Chapter 11 receive, in respect of their claims and interests, as applicable, at least 50 of the vote and value of the stock of the corporation pursuant to a confirmed Chapter 11 plan (the 382(l)(5) Exception ). We expect to seek an order of the Bankruptcy Court on or around the filing of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case that will establish certain procedures to protect the potential value of our NOL carryforwards for use in connection with the reorganization. In addition, we believe that the transactions contemplated by the Plan will result in an ownership change, and we expect that the application of the 382(l)(5) Exception could result in significant future cash tax savings over other alternative approaches and transaction forms. However, it is uncertain whether the consummation of the Plan will satisfy all of the requirements of the 382(l)(5) Exception, as such determination will depend on several factors, including the extent to which holders of certain of our indebtedness may be treated as qualified creditors . The rules relating to the use of pre-bankruptcy tax attributes by a corporation emerging from a bankruptcy are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, there cannot be any assurance that we will be entitled to use such attributes following emergence from the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. 
 
 We may not generate sufficient liquidity to operate our business. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 51.1 million and restricted cash of 47.1 million and continue to meet our obligations to customers, vendors, counterparties and employees in the ordinary course of 
 86 

Table of Contents 

business. However, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. 
 
 We expect to use our cash and cash equivalents to finance our future capital requirements and UACC s four senior secured warehouse facility agreements (the Warehouse Credit Facilities to fund our finance receivables. Certain advance rates available to UACC on borrowings from the Warehouse Credit Facilities have decreased as a result of the increasing credit losses in UACC's portfolio and overall higher interest rates. Any future decreases on available advance rates may have an adverse impact on our liquidity. If we are unable to maintain the Warehouse Credit Facilities, all of which expire on varying dates in 2025 absent renewal, on favorable terms or at all, or if they are terminated or expire and are not renewed or we are unable to find a satisfactory replacement, we may be unable to fund our finance receivables, and our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows would be materially adversely affected. 
 
 In addition, in April 2024, UACC sold approximately 262.5 million of rated asset-backed securities in an auto loan securitization transaction from a securitization trust, established and sponsored by UACC for proceeds of 261.3 million. The trust is collateralized by finance receivables with an aggregate principal balance of 380.1 million. These finance receivables are serviced by UACC. As a result of market conditions, UACC retained the Class E non-investment grade securities and residual interests, which will require us to account for the 2024-1 securitization as secured borrowings and remain on balance sheet pending the sale of such retained interests. In May 2024, UACC sold approximately 37.5 million of Class E non-investment grade securities that were initially retained for proceeds of 35.9 million. 
 
 Our revenue growth may be adversely affected by factors including our inability to grow and develop the UACC and CarStory businesses; weakness in the automotive retail industry generally; general economic conditions, including high interest rates and inflation; global pandemics and other public health emergencies; and increasing competition. Our historical revenue growth is not indicative of our future performance, particularly given the wind-down of our ecommerce business. If we are unable to grow and develop the UACC and CarStory businesses and generate sufficient revenue and achieve profitability, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, our cash needs may increase in the future as we focus on growing and developing the UACC and CarStory businesses. 
 
 In addition to our ongoing cash requirements, in the near term, our liquidity will also be used to fund costs related to the wind-down of our ecommerce operations, primarily severance and early contract and lease termination payments. Such payments could be significant and have a material effect on our cash flows from operations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the outcome of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, ability to realize the benefits of the Value Maximization Plan, available advance rates on and the amendment and renewal of the Warehouse Credit Facilities, the ability to continue to meet the requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the ability to complete additional securitization transactions on terms favorable to us, future credit losses, the ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet obligations and repay liabilities arising from business operations when they come due, the ability to generate and maintain sufficient cash, and the ability to generate profitable operations in the future. There can be no assurance that our liquidity will be sufficient to achieve the objectives of our Value Maximization Plan, grow and develop UACC and CarStory, operate our business, or comply with the terms of our indebtedness. See " UACC may be unable to continue to access or renew funding sources and obtain capital needed to maintain and grow its business" and Our indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our debt obligations. 
 
 UACC may be unable to continue to access or renew funding sources and obtain capital needed to maintain and grow its business. 
 
 UACC uses debt financing to maintain and grow its business. UACC relies on borrowings under senior secured warehouse credit facilities to finance the origination of finance receivables as well as to provide funding for general operating activities. The terms of those facilities generally mature within two years and we typically renew those facilities in the ordinary course. UACC currently has four Warehouse Credit Facilities, all of which have terms expiring between June and September 2025. See Note 9, Warehouse Credit Facilities and Consolidated VIEs, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and "UACC may be unable to continue to access or renew funding sources and obtain capital needed to maintain and grow its business." We have commenced discussions with our lenders under the Warehouse Credit Facilities regarding amended facilities that would extend the terms beyond the current expiration dates. Failure to secure warehouse borrowing capacity beyond the expiration of the current facilities 
 87 

Table of Contents 

in 2025 would have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance UACC s lending operations and our results of operations and liquidity. We cannot guarantee that the Warehouse Credit Facilities will continue to be available beyond their current maturity dates, on acceptable terms, or at all, or that UACC will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the losses incurred in UACC's loan portfolio, UACC s financial position, its results of operations, and the capacity for additional borrowing under its existing financing arrangements. If UACC s various financing alternatives were to become limited or unavailable, it may be unable to maintain or grow origination volume at the level that we anticipate and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. 
 
 There are risks associated with the discontinuance of our ecommerce operations and wind-down of our used vehicle dealership business. 
 
 On January 22, 2024, we announced the Value Maximization Plan, pursuant to which we discontinued our ecommerce operations and wound down our used vehicle dealership business in order to preserve cash and maximize stakeholder value through our remaining businesses. As a result, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs including severance costs, inventory liquidation costs, contract and lease termination costs and non-cash asset impairments, and such costs are expected to exceed any cash we generate on the liquidation of assets. We estimate that we will incur total cash charges during 2024 of approximately 15.9 million for severance and other personnel-related costs, with 0.2 million and 15.8 million incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively and approximately 13.9 million in contract and lease termination costs, with 0.4 million and 13.9 million settled during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The actual amount of wind down, transition and impairment charges may materially exceed our estimates, due to various factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the outcomes of discussions and negotiations with the counterparties to the remaining contracts and leases we intend to terminate or modify. In addition, because of uncertainties with respect to our wind-down plan (including those described above), we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of or complete the wind-down in the expected timeframe, on the terms or in the manner we expect, or at all, and the costs incurred in connection with such wind-down activities may exceed our estimates. If the time to complete the wind-down takes longer than expected, or the actual costs or impairment charges exceed our estimates, the Company s business, operational results, financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 
 The purpose of the Value Maximization Plan was to wind-down our ecommerce operations, which were not profitable and had significant cash burn, in order to preserve cash and enable us to maximize stakeholder value through our remaining businesses, UACC and CarStory. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 51.1 million. Given our wind-down expenses, including employee severance costs, our ongoing operating expenses and recent losses at UACC, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in achieving profitability and creating meaningful stakeholder value. 
 
 Additionally, the announced wind-down involves further risks, including: 
 the ongoing cost of retaining (as was realized in connection with the payment of retention bonuses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024) and, in some cases, the inability to retain qualified personnel necessary to achieve our goals for UACC and CarStory; 

potential disruption of the operations of the rest of our businesses and diversion of management s attention from such businesses and operations; 

exposure to unknown, contingent or other liabilities, including litigation arising in connection with the wind-down; 

negative impact on our business relationships, including but not limited to potential relationships with our customers, suppliers, vendors, licensees and employees; and 

unintended negative consequences from changes to our business. 

If any of these or other factors impair our ability to successfully implement the wind-down, we may not be able to realize other business opportunities as we may be required to spend additional time and incur additional expense relating to the wind-down that otherwise would be used on the development, expansion and profitability of our other businesses, which could adversely impact our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.

We are, and may in the future be, subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. If the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to various litigation matters from time to time, the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals, either individually or through class actions, by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings or by other entities. These claims could be asserted under a variety of laws, including but not limited to consumer finance laws, consumer protection laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, labor and employment laws, securities laws and employee benefit laws. These actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business. For example, a consolidated class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting claims on behalf of a putative class of Company stockholders against us, certain of our officers, and certain of our directors, among others, alleging violations of the federal securities laws. We also are a party to certain stockholder derivative suits in which the Company is named as a nominal defendant in suits that various individual stockholders seek to bring on behalf of the Company against certain of our current and former directors and officers. These suits are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and are based on the same general course of conduct alleged in the consolidated securities class action. We believe these lawsuits are without merit and intend to vigorously contest these claims. 
 
 In January 2022, the Company received a non-public civil investigative demand from the Federal Trade Commission FTC ), seeking the production of information related to certain of the Company's business practices and the Company responded to those information requests. On February 23, 2024, the FTC notified the Company that it has reason to believe that the Company violated Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(a); the FTC's Mail, Internet, or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule, 16 C.F.R. Part 435; the FTC s Used Motor Vehicle Trade Regulation Rule,16 C.F.R. Part 455; and the FTC s Pre-Sale Availability Rule, 16 C.F.R. Part 702. On May 6, 2024, Vroom, Inc., Vroom Automotive, LLC and the FTC reached an agreement to resolve the FTC s allegations without any admission of wrongdoing by either Vroom entity, subject to final approval by the FTC and the court. Under the agreement, the Company agreed to pay a total of 1 million in customer redress and abide permanently by an injunction. The FTC issued its final approval of the agreement on July 2, 2024, and a mutually-agreed upon order reflecting the agreement was entered by the Court on July 10, 2024. The case is captioned Federal Trade Commission v. Vroom, Inc. et al., Case No. 4:24-cv-02496. 
 
 In addition, in April 2022, the Attorney General of Texas filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of Texas in the District Court of Travis County, Texas against the Company, alleging violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Consumer Protection Act and Texas Business and Commerce Code 17.41 et seq. In December 2023, Vroom, Inc., Vroom Automotive, LLC and the Attorney General of the State of Texas reached a final agreement to resolve all claims in the petition, without any admission of wrongdoing by either Vroom entity. Under the agreement, the Company agreed to pay a total of 2 million in civil penalties and 1 million in attorneys' fees, with the first half due in September 2024 and the remaining half due in September 2025, and abide permanently by an injunction of certain operational practices that were previously implemented. The agreement was approved by the District Court of Travis County on December 13, 2023. 
 
 Upon the filing of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, it is anticipated that all litigation against the Debtor will be stayed pursuant to the automatic stay of the Bankruptcy Code. The RSA contemplates that all existing litigation will be unimpaired by the bankruptcy and the associated liabilities are not currently proposed to be discharged pursuant to the proposed plan of reorganization. Following the Plan Effective Date, it is anticipated that any litigation stayed during the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case will continue. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings for more information about these matters and the other legal proceedings to which we are subject. 
 
 We depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, integrate, adequately compensate, and attract qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed. 
 
 We believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to retain, develop, motivate and attract highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to retain and attract them. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of our leadership team to the development of our business,

future vision, and strategic direction, including as we realign our business in accordance with the Value Maximization Plan. On February 29, 2024, James G. Vagim, III, UACC's Co-President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ravi Gandhi, UACC's Co-President and Chief Financial Officer stepped down. The Company's Chief Executive Officer, Tom Shortt, succeeded Mr. Vagim as President and Chief Executive Officer of UACC, and the Company's Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning Analysis, Jon Sandison, succeeded Mr. Gandhi as UACC's Chief Financial Officer. On May 17, 2024 (the "CFO Transition Date"), Robert R. Krakowiak ceased his service as Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and principal financial officer of the Company. On May 6, 2024, the Board appointed Mr. Krakowiak as a member of the board of directors (the Board of the Company, and as Vice Chair of the Board, in each case effective as of the CFO Transition Date, for a term ending at the Company's 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"), where he was re-elected by our stockholders for a term ending at the Company's 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. On the CFO Transition Date, the Company's Senior Vice President and principal accounting officer, Agnieszka Zakowicz, succeeded Mr. Krakowiak as the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and principal financial officer and retained her role as principal accounting officer. Also effective on the CFO Transition Date, C. Denise Stott stepped down as the Company's Chief People Culture Officer. On August 16, 2024, Amy Castell, UACC s General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, stepped down, followed by Patricia Moran, the Company s Chief Legal Officer, stepping down on August 23, 2024. Anna-Lisa Corrales was appointed as the Company s Chief Legal Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary. Our future performance will depend, in part, on the successful transition of these positions and any other key management positions that may experience turnover in the future. We heavily rely on the continued service and performance of our senior management team, which provides leadership, contributes to the core areas of our business and helps us to efficiently execute our business, including with respect to strategic initiatives such as our Value Maximization Plan. If members of our senior management team, including our executive leadership, become ill, or if we are otherwise unable to retain them, we may not be able to manage our business effectively and, as a result, our business and operating results could be harmed. See The anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case will consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. If the senior management team, including any new hires that we make, fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis, or if we are unable to retain key employees in a cost-effective manner or at all, then our business and future growth prospects could be harmed. 
 
 In addition, we issue equity awards to certain of our employees as part of our hiring and retention efforts, and job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. Our employees inability to sell their shares in the public market at times and/or at prices desired may lead to a larger than normal turnover rate. The market value of our common stock has declined significantly. If the actual or perceived value of our common stock does not recover, or if our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market, it may adversely affect our ability to hire or retain employees. See Risk Factors We may be unable to satisfy a continued listing rule from the Nasdaq . In addition, we may periodically change our equity compensation practices, which may include reducing the number of employees eligible for equity awards or reducing the size or value of equity awards granted per employee or undertaking other efforts that may prove to be an unsuccessful retention mechanism. For instance, on April 27, 2024, our Board of Directors adopted, and on June 13, 2024 our stockholders approved, an amendment to the Company s 2020 Incentive Award Plan (the 2020 Plan to (i) increase the number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance under the 2020 Plan by 350,000 shares and (ii) correspondingly increase by 350,000 shares the limit on the number of shares that can be issued under the 2020 Plan pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options. The purpose of the amendment was to ensure the Company has a sufficient reserve of shares available to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors who are essential to the Company s long-term growth while preserving cash, particularly in light of the goals of the Value Maximization Plan. If we are unable to make meaningful equity awards to our employees or directors, or otherwise fail to attract, integrate, adequately compensate, or retain the qualified and highly skilled personnel required to fulfill our current or future needs, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed. 
 
 Furthermore, in light of the reduction in headcount as part of our Value Maximization Plan and the impact of the anticipated Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, we may find it difficult to maintain valuable aspects of our culture, to prevent a negative effect on employee morale or attrition beyond our planned reduction in headcount, and to attract competent personnel who are willing to embrace our culture in the future. Our executive officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We may not be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees, particularly in light of the discontinuance of our ecommerce business and wind-down of our used vehicle dealership business. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating

existing employees or attracting well-qualified employees in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

The Reorganized Debtor, as the successor-in-interest to the Debtor and the Estate, may, and shall have the exclusive right to, enforce, sue on, settle, compromise, transfer, or assign (or decline to do any of the foregoing) any or all of such Causes of Action without notice to or approval from the Bankruptcy Court. 
 	 29 

No Entity may rely on the absence of a specific reference in this Plan, the Plan Supplement (including the Schedule of Retained Causes of Action), or the Disclosure Statement to any Cause of Action against it as any indication that the Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, will not pursue any and all available Causes of Action of the Debtor against it. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Debtor and the Reorganized Debtor expressly reserve all rights to prosecute any and all Causes of Action against any Entity. 
 The Debtor expressly reserves all Causes of Action and Litigation Claims for later adjudication by the Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor (including, without limitation, Causes of Action and Litigation Claims not specifically identified in the Plan Supplement or the Schedule of Retained Causes of Action or of which the Debtor may presently be unaware or which may arise or exist by reason of additional facts or circumstances unknown to the Debtor at this time or facts or circumstances that may change or be different from those the Debtor now believes to exist) and, therefore, no preclusion doctrine, including, without limitation, the doctrines of res judicata , collateral estoppel, issue preclusion, claim preclusion, waiver, estoppel (judicial, equitable or otherwise) or laches shall apply to such Causes of Action or Litigation Claims upon or after the Confirmation or Consummation of this Plan based on the Disclosure Statement, this Plan or the Combined Order, except in each case where such Causes of Action or Litigation Claims have been expressly waived, relinquished, released, compromised or settled in this Plan (including, without limitation, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Releases contained in Article X.B and Exculpation contained in Article X.E hereof) or any other Final Order (including, without limitation, the Combined Order). In addition, the Debtor and the Reorganized Debtor expressly reserve the right to pursue or adopt any claims alleged in any lawsuit in which the Debtor is a plaintiff, defendant, or an interested party, against any Person or Entity, including, without limitation, the plaintiffs or co-defendants in such lawsuits. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the Debtor and the Reorganized Debtor do not reserve any Causes of Action or Litigation Claims that have been expressly released (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Claims otherwise released pursuant to the Debtor Releases provided in Article X.B and the Exculpation contained in Article X.E of this Plan). 
 O. Payment of Fees and Expenses of Certain Creditors

 Article III. TREATMENT OF EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES 

A. Assumption or Rejection of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases 

On the Effective Date, all Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases of the Debtor will be assumed by the Debtor in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions and requirements of sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code, except for those Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases that, in each case: 
 1. have been assumed or rejected by the Debtor by prior order of the Bankruptcy Court; 

2. are the subject of a motion to reject Filed by the Debtor pending on the Effective Date; 

3. are identified as rejected Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases by the Debtor on the Schedule of Rejected Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases to be Filed in the Plan Supplement, which may be amended by the Debtor up to and through the Effective Date to add or remove Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases by Filing with the Bankruptcy Court a subsequent Plan Supplement and serving it on the affected non-Debtor contract parties; or 

4. are rejected or terminated pursuant to the terms of this Plan. 

Without amending or altering any prior order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the assumption or rejection of any Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease, the Combined Order shall constitute an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving such assumptions and the rejection of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases set forth in the Schedule of Rejected Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases pursuant to sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code as of the Effective Date. 
 To the extent any provision in any Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease assumed or assumed and assigned (as applicable) pursuant to this Plan or any prior order of the Bankruptcy Court (including, without limitation, any change of control provision) prohibits, restricts or conditions, or purports to prohibit, restrict or condition, or is modified, breached or terminated, or deemed modified, breached or terminated by, (a) the commencement of the Chapter 11 Case or the insolvency or financial condition of the Debtor at any time before the closing of the Chapter 11 Case, (b) the Debtor s or the Reorganized Debtor s assumption or assumption and assignment (as applicable) of such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease or (c) the Confirmation or Consummation of this Plan, then such provision shall be deemed modified such that the transactions contemplated by this Plan shall not entitle the non-Debtor party thereto to modify or terminate such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease or to exercise any other default-related rights or remedies with respect thereto, and any required consent under any such contract or lease shall be deemed satisfied by the confirmation of this Plan. 
 	 31 

Each Executory Contract and Unexpired Lease assumed and/or assigned pursuant to this Plan shall revest in and be fully enforceable by the Reorganized Debtor or the applicable assignee in accordance with its terms and conditions, except as modified by the provisions of this Plan, any order of the Bankruptcy Court approving its assumption and/or assignment, or applicable law. 
 The inclusion or exclusion of a contract or lease on any schedule or exhibit shall not constitute an admission by the Debtor that such contract or lease is an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease or that the Debtor has any liability thereunder. 
 B. Payments Related to Assumption of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases 

Any monetary defaults under each Executory Contract and Unexpired Lease to be assumed pursuant to this Plan shall be satisfied, pursuant to section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, by payment of the default amount in Cash on the Effective Date or on such other terms as the parties to such Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases may otherwise agree. In the event of a dispute regarding: (a) the amount of any Cure Claim; (b) the ability of the Reorganized Debtor to provide adequate assurance of future performance (within the meaning of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code), if applicable, under the Executory Contract or the Unexpired Lease to be assumed; or (c) any other matter pertaining to assumption, the Cure Claims shall be paid following the entry of a Final Order resolving the dispute and approving the assumption of such Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases; provided , that after the Confirmation Date, the Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, may settle any dispute regarding the amount of any Cure Claim without any further notice to or action, order or approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

All Proofs of Claim with respect to Claims arising from the rejection of Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases, pursuant to this Plan or the Combined Order, if any, must be Filed with the Bankruptcy Court within twenty-one (21) days after service of an order of the Bankruptcy Court (including the Combined Order) approving such rejection. Any Claim arising from the rejection of Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases that becomes an Allowed Claim is classified and shall be treated as a Class 4 General Unsecured Claim. 
 Any Person or Entity that is required to File a Proof of Claim arising from the rejection of an Executory Contract or an Unexpired Lease that fails to timely do so shall be forever barred, estopped, and enjoined from asserting such Claim, and such Claim shall not be enforceable, against the Debtor, the Reorganized Debtor, or the Estate, and the Debtor, its Estate, and the Reorganized Debtor, and their respective assets and property, shall be forever discharged from any and all indebtedness and liability with respect to such Claim unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court or as otherwise provided herein. All such Claims shall, as of the Effective Date, be subject to the permanent injunction set forth in Article X.F hereof. 
 D. D O Liability Insurance Policies 

On the Effective Date, each D O Liability Insurance Policy shall be deemed and treated as an Executory Contract that is and will be assumed by the Debtor (and assigned to the 
 	 32 

Reorganized Debtor, if necessary) pursuant to section 365(a) and section 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code as to which no Proof of Claim, request for administrative expense, or Cure Claim need be Filed, and all Claims arising from the D O Liability Insurance Policies will survive the Effective Date and be Unimpaired. Unless previously effectuated by separate order entered by the Bankruptcy Court, entry of the Combined Order shall constitute the Bankruptcy Court s approval of the Debtor s assumption of each of the D O Liability Insurance Policies. 
 In furtherance of the foregoing, the Reorganized Debtor shall maintain and continue in full force and effect the D O Liability Insurance Policies for the benefit of the insured Persons for the full term of such policies, and all insured Persons, including without limitation, any members, managers, directors, and officers of the Reorganized Debtor who served in such capacity at any time prior to the Effective Date or any other individuals covered by such D O Liability Insurance Policies, shall be entitled to the full benefits of any such policies for the full term of such policies regardless of whether such insured Persons remain in such positions after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after assumption of the D O Liability Insurance Policies, nothing in this Plan or the Combined Order alters the terms and conditions of the D O Liability Insurance Policies. Confirmation and Consummation of this Plan shall not impair or otherwise modify any available defenses of the Reorganized Debtor under the D O Liability Insurance Policies. For the avoidance of doubt, the D O Liability Insurance Policies shall continue to apply with respect to actions, or failures to act, that occurred on or prior to the Effective Date, subject to the terms and conditions of the D O Liability Insurance Policies. 
 The Debtor is further authorized to take such actions, and to execute and deliver such documents, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to implement, maintain, cause the binding of, satisfy any terms or conditions of, or otherwise secure for the insureds the benefits of the D O Tail, without further notice to or order of the Bankruptcy Court or approval or consent of any Person or Entity. 
 E. Indemnification Provisions 

On the Effective Date, all Indemnification Provisions shall be deemed and treated as Executory Contracts that are and shall be assumed by the Debtor (and assigned to the Reorganized Debtor, if necessary) pursuant to section 365(a) and section 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code as to which no Proof of Claim, request for administrative expense, or Cure Claim need be Filed, and all Claims arising from the Indemnification Provisions shall survive the Effective Date and be Unimpaired. Unless previously effectuated by separate order entered by the Bankruptcy Court, entry of the Combined Order shall constitute the Bankruptcy Court s approval of the Debtor s assumption of each of the Indemnification Provisions. Confirmation and Consummation of this Plan shall not impair or otherwise modify any available defenses of the Reorganized Debtor or other applicable parties under the Indemnification Provisions. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnification Provisions shall continue to apply with respect to actions, or failures to act, that occurred on or prior to the Effective Date, subject to the terms and conditions of the Indemnification Provisions.

All Proofs of Claim Filed for amounts due under any Specified Employee Plans shall be considered satisfied by the applicable agreement and/or program and agreement to assume and cure in the ordinary course as provided in this Plan.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Debtor and the Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, shall honor all its obligations under section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code. After the Effective Date, the New Board shall, in its discretion, implement employee incentive or bonus plans as and when it deems appropriate in accordance with the terms of any applicable New Governance Document; provided , that the MIP shall be implemented pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Plan, including Article V.F hereof. Unless previously effectuated by separate order entered by the Bankruptcy Court, entry of the Combined Order shall constitute the Bankruptcy Court s approval of the Debtor s assumption of each of the Specified Employee Plans. 
 G. Insurance Contracts

Unless previously effectuated by separate order entered by the Bankruptcy Court, entry of the Combined Order shall constitute the Bankruptcy Court s approval of the Debtor s assumption of each of the Insurance Contracts. Confirmation and Consummation of this Plan shall not impair or otherwise modify any available defenses of the Reorganized Debtor or any insurer under the Insurance Contracts. 
 H. Extension of Time to Assume or Reject 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Article VI of this Plan, in the event of a dispute as to whether a contract is executory or a lease is unexpired, the right of the Reorganized Debtor to move to assume or reject such contract or lease shall be extended until the date that is ten (10) days after entry of a Final Order by the Bankruptcy Court determining that the contract is executory or the lease is unexpired. The deemed assumption provided for in Article VI.A of this Plan shall not apply to any such contract or lease, and any such contract or lease shall be assumed or rejected only upon motion of the Reorganized Debtor following the Bankruptcy Court s determination that the contract is executory or the lease is unexpired. 
 	 34 

I. Modifications, Amendments, Supplements, Restatements, or Other Agreements 

Unless otherwise provided in this Plan, each Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease that is assumed by the Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor shall include all modifications, amendments, supplements, restatements, or other agreements that in any manner affect such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease, and all rights related thereto, if any, including all easements, licenses, permits, rights, privileges, immunities, options, rights of first refusal, and any other interests, unless any of the foregoing has been previously rejected or repudiated or is rejected or repudiated hereunder. Modifications, amendments, supplements, and restatements to prepetition Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases that have been executed by the Debtor during the Chapter 11 Case shall not be deemed to alter the prepetition nature of the Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease, or the validity, priority, or amount of any Claims that may arise in connection therewith. 
 J. Contracts and Leases Entered into After the Petition Date 

Contracts and leases entered into after the Petition Date by the Debtor may be performed by the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor in the ordinary course of business without further approval of the Bankruptcy Court. 
 K. Reservation of Rights 

Nothing contained in this Plan or the Plan Supplement shall constitute an admission by the Debtor or any other party that any contract or lease is in fact an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease or that the Reorganized Debtor has any liability thereunder. If there is a dispute regarding whether a contract or lease is or was executory or unexpired at the time of assumption, the Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, shall have forty-five (45) days following entry of a Final Order resolving such dispute to alter its treatment of such contract or lease. 
 
 Article IV. PROVISIONS GOVERNING DISTRIBUTIONS 

A. Timing and Calculation of Amounts to Be Distributed 

Unless otherwise provided in this Plan, on the Effective Date (or if a Claim or Equity Interest is not an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest on the Effective Date, on the date that such Claim or Equity Interest becomes an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest, or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter), each Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest (as applicable) shall receive the full amount of the distributions that this Plan provides for Allowed Claims or Allowed Equity Interests (as applicable) in the applicable Class; provided , that any Allowed Administrative Claims with respect to liabilities incurred by the Debtor in the ordinary course of business during the Chapter 11 Case or assumed by the Debtor prior to the Effective Date shall be paid or performed in the ordinary course of business. 
 	 35 

In the event that any payment or act under this Plan is required to be made or performed on a date that is not a Business Day, then the making of such payment or the performance of such act may be completed on the next succeeding Business Day but shall be deemed to have been completed as of the required date. If and to the extent that there are Disputed Claims or Disputed Equity Interests, distributions on account of any such Disputed Claims or Disputed Equity Interests shall be made pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article VIII. 
 B. Distribution Agent 

Except as otherwise provided in the Combined Order, all distributions under this Plan shall be made by the Distribution Agent on the Effective Date, except as otherwise set forth herein. The Reorganized Debtor may employ or contract with other Entities to assist in or make the distributions required by this Plan and may pay the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of such Entities and the Distribution Agent in the ordinary course of business. The Distribution Agent shall not be required to give any bond or surety or other security for the performance of its duties unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court. Additionally, in the event that the Distribution Agent is so otherwise ordered, all costs and expenses of procuring any such bond or surety shall be borne by the Reorganized Debtor. 
 C. Rights and Powers of Distribution Agent 

1. Powers of the Distribution Agent 

The Distribution Agent shall be empowered to: (a) effect all actions and execute all agreements, instruments, and other documents necessary to perform its duties under this Plan; (b) make all distributions contemplated hereby; (c) employ professionals to represent it with respect to its responsibilities; and (d) exercise such other powers as may be vested in the Distribution Agent by order of the Bankruptcy Court, pursuant to this Plan, or as deemed by the Distribution Agent to be necessary and proper to implement the provisions hereof. 
 Distributions on account of the Allowed Unsecured Notes Claims shall be made to (or in coordination with) the Unsecured Notes Indenture Trustee and the Unsecured Notes Indenture Trustee will be, and shall act as, the Distribution Agent with respect to the Unsecured Notes Claims in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Plan and the Unsecured Notes Documents. All distributions to Holders of Allowed Unsecured Notes Claims shall be deemed completed when made by the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor to (or at the direction or consent of) the Unsecured Notes Indenture Trustee. 
 2. Expenses Incurred on or After the Effective Date 

Except as otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, the amount of any reasonable and documented fees and expenses incurred by the Distribution Agent on or after the Effective Date (including taxes), and any reasonable and documented compensation and expense reimbursement claims (including reasonable and documented attorney fees and expenses) made by the Distribution Agent, shall be paid in Cash by the Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, and as of the date of such completion with respect to distributions made to Holders of Allowed Unsecured Notes Claims, the duties of the Unsecured Notes Indenture Trustee with respect to such distributions shall be deemed satisfied and discharged. 
 	 36 

For the avoidance of doubt, if and to the extent the Unsecured Notes Indenture Trustee serves as the Distribution Agent with respect to the Unsecured Notes Claims, (a) the Unsecured Notes Indenture Trustee shall incur no liability and be held harmless by the Reorganized Debtor, except for its fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, and (b) the Distribution Agent shall be deemed to be an additional capacity of the Unsecured Notes Indenture Trustee under the applicable Unsecured Notes Documents entitling it to all rights, privileges, benefits, immunities, and protections provided under such documents. 
 D. Special Rules for Distributions to Holders of Disputed Claims and Disputed Interests. 

Except as otherwise agreed by the relevant parties: (a) no partial payments and no partial distributions shall be made with respect to a Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest until all such disputes in connection with such Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest have been resolved by settlement or Final Order; and (b) any Entity that holds both an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest and a Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest shall not receive any distribution on the Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest unless and until all objections to the Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest have been resolved by settlement or Final Order or such Claims or Equity Interests have been Allowed or expunged. 
 E. Delivery of Distributions 

1. Delivery of Distributions in General 

Except as otherwise provided herein, the Distribution Agent shall make distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed Equity Interests as of the Distribution Record Date, or, if applicable, to such Holders respective designees, as appropriate: (a) at the address for each such Holder as indicated on the Debtor s records as of the Distribution Record Date (or of a designee designated by a Holder of Unsecured Notes Claims); (b) to the signatory set forth on any Proof of Claim Filed by such Holder or other Representative identified therein (or at the last known addresses of such Holder if no Proof of Claim is Filed or if the Debtor has not been notified in writing of a change of address); (c) at the addresses set forth in any written notices of address changes delivered to the Reorganized Debtor or the applicable Distribution Agent, as appropriate, after the date of any related Proof of Claim; or (d) on any counsel that has appeared in the Chapter 11 Case on the Holder s behalf; provided , that the manner of such distributions shall be determined at the discretion of the Reorganized Debtor. 
 2. Delivery of Distributions on Account of Unsecured Notes Claims 

The Unsecured Notes Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to be the Holder of all Allowed Unsecured Notes Claims for purposes of distributions to be made hereunder, and all distributions on account of such Allowed Claims shall be made to or at the direction of the Unsecured Notes Indenture Trustee. As soon as practicable following compliance with the requirements set forth in Article VII, if applicable, the Unsecured Notes Indenture Trustee shall arrange to deliver or direct the delivery of such distributions to or on behalf of the Holders of Allowed Unsecured Notes Claims in accordance with the terms of the Unsecured Notes Indenture and this Plan. 
 The Unsecured Notes Indenture Trustee, in its capacity as Distribution Agent, may transfer or facilitate the transfer of distributions to Holders of Unsecured Notes Claims through 
 	 37 

the facilities of DTC in exchange for the relevant Unsecured Notes. If it is necessary to adopt alternate, additional, or supplemental distribution procedures for any reason, including because such distributions cannot be made through the facilities of DTC, to otherwise effectuate the distributions under this Plan, the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, shall implement the Alternate/Supplemental Distribution Process. 
 Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary and without limiting the exculpation and release provisions of this Plan, the Unsecured Notes Indenture Trustee shall not have any liability to any Entity with respect to distributions made or directed to be made by the Unsecured Notes Indenture Trustee. 
 3. Minimum Distributions 

No fractional shares or units of New Common Stock or Post-Effective Date Equity Awards shall be distributed and no Cash shall be distributed in lieu of such fractional amounts. Whenever any payment or distribution of a fraction of a dollar, share, or unit of New Common Stock or Post-Effective Date Equity Awards under this Plan would otherwise be called for, the actual payment or distribution will reflect (a) with respect to New Common Stock, a rounding of such fraction to the nearest whole dollar, share, or unit of New Common Stock or Post-Effective Date Equity Awards (up or down), with half dollars, shares, or units of New Common Stock or less being rounded down; and (b) with respect to Post-Effective Date Equity Awards, a rounding of such fraction down to the nearest whole dollar, share, or unit of Post-Effective Date Equity Awards. The total number of authorized shares of New Common Stock or shares or units of Post-Effective Date Equity Awards, as applicable, shall be adjusted as necessary to account for the foregoing rounding. 
 No Distribution Agent shall have any obligation to make a distribution on account of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest that is Impaired under this Plan if the amount to be distributed to the specific Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest on the Effective Date does not constitute a final distribution to such Holder and is or has an economic value less than 25.00, which shall be treated as an undeliverable distribution under Article VII.D.4 below. 
 4. Undeliverable Distributions 

(a) Holding of Certain Undeliverable Distributions 

If the distribution to any Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest is returned to the Distribution Agent as undeliverable or is otherwise unclaimed, no further distributions shall be made to such Holder unless and until the Distribution Agent is notified in writing of such Holder s then current address in accordance with the time frames described in Article VII.D.4(b) hereof, at which time (or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter) all currently due but missed distributions shall be made to such Holder. Undeliverable distributions shall remain in the possession of the Reorganized Debtor, subject to Article VII.D.4(b) hereof, until such time as any such distributions become deliverable. Undeliverable distributions shall not be entitled to any additional interest, dividends, or other accruals of any kind on account of their distribution being undeliverable. 
 	 38 

(b) Failure to Claim Undeliverable Distributions 

Any Holder of an Allowed Claim or an Allowed Equity Interest (or any successor or assignee or other Person or Entity claiming by, through, or on behalf of such Holder) that does not assert a right pursuant to this Plan for an undeliverable or unclaimed distribution within ninety (90) days after the later of the Effective Date or the date such distribution is due shall be deemed to have forfeited its rights for such undeliverable or unclaimed distribution and shall be forever barred and enjoined from asserting any such rights for an undeliverable or unclaimed distribution against the Debtor or its Estate, the Reorganized Debtor or their respective assets or property, or any Distribution Agent. In such case, any Cash, Plan Securities, or other property reserved for distribution on account of such Claim shall become the property of the Reorganized Debtor free and clear of any Claims or other rights of such Holder with respect thereto and notwithstanding any federal or state escheat laws to the contrary. Any such Cash, Plan Securities, and/or other property, as applicable, shall thereafter be distributed or allocated in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of this Plan. Nothing contained in this Plan shall require the Debtor, the Reorganized Debtor, or any Distribution Agent to attempt to locate any Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest. 
 (c) Failure to Present Checks 

Checks issued by the Distribution Agent on account of Allowed Claims shall be null and void if not negotiated within ninety (90) days after the issuance of such check. Requests for reissuance of any check shall be made directly to the Distribution Agent by the Holder of the relevant Allowed Claim with respect to which such check originally was issued. Any Holder of an Allowed Claim holding an un-negotiated check that does not request reissuance of such un-negotiated check within ninety (90) days after the date of mailing or other delivery of such check shall have its rights for such un-negotiated check discharged and be forever barred, estopped and enjoined from asserting any such right against the Debtor, its Estate, the Reorganized Debtor, or their respective assets or property. In such case, any Cash held for payment on account of such Claims shall become the property of the Reorganized Debtor, free and clear of any Claims or other rights of such Holder with respect thereto and notwithstanding any federal or state escheat laws to the contrary. Any such Cash shall thereafter be distributed or allocated in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of this Plan. 
 F. No Postpetition Interest on Claims 

Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this Plan, the Combined Order, or another Final Order of the Bankruptcy Court, or required by applicable bankruptcy law (including, without limitation, as required pursuant to section 506(b) or section 511 of the Bankruptcy Code), postpetition interest shall not accrue or be paid on any Claims and no Holder of a Claim or Equity Interest shall be entitled to interest accruing on or after the Petition Date on any Claim. 
 G. Compliance with Tax Requirements 

In connection with this Plan and all distributions hereunder, the Reorganized Debtor or other applicable Distribution Agent shall comply with all applicable withholding and reporting requirements imposed by any federal, state, local, or foreign taxing authority, and all 
 	 39 

distributions hereunder and under all related agreements shall be subject to any such withholding and reporting requirements. The Reorganized Debtor or other applicable Distribution Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to take any and all actions that may be necessary or appropriate to comply with such applicable withholding and reporting requirements, including (a) withholding distributions and amounts therefrom pending receipt of information necessary to facilitate such distributions, including properly executed withholding certification forms, and (b) in the case of a non-Cash distribution that is subject to withholding, withholding an appropriate portion of such property and either liquidating such withheld property to generate sufficient funds to pay applicable withholding taxes (or reimburse the distributing party for any advance payment of the withholding tax) or pay the withholding tax using its own funds and retain such withheld property. Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, upon request of the Debtor, the Reorganized Debtor or any other applicable Distribution Agent, all Persons holding Claims or Equity Interests shall be required to provide any information necessary to effect information reporting and the withholding of such taxes (or to establish eligibility for a reduction of or an exemption from the withholding of any taxes), and each Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest will have the sole and exclusive responsibility for the satisfaction and payment of any tax obligations imposed by any Governmental Unit, including income, withholding, and other tax obligations, on account of such distribution. Any amounts withheld or reallocated pursuant to this Article VII.G. shall be treated as if distributed to the Holder of the Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest. 
 Any Person or Entity entitled to receive any property as an issuance or distribution under this Plan shall, upon request, deliver to the Reorganized Debtor or other applicable Distribution Agent, or such other Person designated by the Reorganized Debtor or the Distribution Agent, an IRS Form W-9 or, if the payee is a foreign Person or Entity, an applicable IRS Form W-8, or any other forms or documents reasonably requested by the Reorganized Debtor or Distribution Agent to reduce or eliminate any withholding required by any applicable Governmental Unit. 
 The Reorganized Debtor reserves the right to allocate all distributions made under this Plan in compliance with all applicable wage garnishments, alimony, child support and other spousal awards, Liens, and encumbrances. 
 H. Allocation of Plan Distributions Between Principal and Interest 

To the extent that any Allowed Claim entitled to a distribution under this Plan is comprised of indebtedness and accrued but unpaid interest thereon, such distribution shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law (as reasonably determined by the Reorganized Debtor), be allocated for income tax purposes to the principal amount of the Claim first and then, to the extent that the consideration exceeds the principal amount of the Claim, to the portion of such Claim representing accrued but unpaid interest. 
 I. Means of Cash Payment 

Payments of Cash made pursuant to this Plan shall be in U.S. dollars and shall be made, at the option of the applicable Distribution Agent, by checks drawn on, or wire transfer from, a domestic bank selected by such Distribution Agent. Cash payments to foreign creditors may be 
 	 40 

made, at the option of such Distribution Agent, in such funds and by such means as are necessary or customary in a particular foreign jurisdiction. 
 J. Timing and Calculation of Amounts to Be Distributed 

Except as otherwise provided in the Treatment sections in Article III hereof or as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, on the Effective Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, each Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest shall receive the full amount of the distributions that this Plan provides for Allowed Claims or Equity Interests in the applicable Class. If and to the extent that there are Disputed Claims or Disputed Equity Interests, distributions on account of any such Disputed Claims or Disputed Equity Interests shall be made pursuant to the provisions set forth in the applicable Class treatment or in Article VIII hereof. Except as otherwise provided herein, Holders of Claims shall not be entitled to interest, dividends or accruals on the distributions provided for herein, regardless of whether such distributions are delivered on or at any time after the Effective Date. 
 K. Claims Paid or Payable by Third Parties 

1. Claims Paid by Third Parties 

A Claim shall be correspondingly reduced, and the applicable portion of such Claim shall be disallowed without an objection to such Claim having to be Filed and without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court, to the extent that the Holder of such Claim receives a payment on account of such Claim from a party that is not the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor. To the extent a Holder of a Claim receives a distribution on account of such Claim and receives payment from a party that is not the Debtor or a Reorganized Debtor on account of such Claim, such Holder shall, within fourteen (14) days of receipt thereof, repay or return the distribution to the Reorganized Debtor to the extent the Holder s total recovery on account of such Claim from the third party and under this Plan exceeds the amount of such Claim as of the date of any such distribution under this Plan. The failure of such Holder to timely repay or return such distribution shall result in the Holder owing the Reorganized Debtor annualized interest at the Federal Judgment Rate on such amount owed for each Business Day after the fourteen-day grace period specified above until the amount is repaid. 
 2. Claims Payable by Insurance Carriers 

No distributions under this Plan shall be made on account of an Allowed Claim that is payable pursuant to one of the Debtor s insurance policies until the Holder of such Allowed Claim has exhausted all remedies with respect to such insurance policy. To the extent that one or more of the Debtor s insurers agrees to satisfy, in full or in part, a Claim (if and to the extent adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction), then immediately upon such insurers agreement, the applicable portion of such Claim may be expunged without a Claim objection having to be Filed and without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court. 
 	 41 

3. Applicability of Insurance Policies 

Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims shall be in accordance with the provisions of any applicable insurance policy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing contained in this Plan shall constitute or be deemed a release, settlement, satisfaction, compromise, or waiver of any Cause of Action that the Debtor or any other Entity may hold against any other Entity, including insurers, under any policies of insurance or applicable indemnity, nor shall anything contained herein constitute or be deemed a waiver by such insurers of any defenses, including coverage defenses, held by such insurers. 
 L. Setoffs 

Without altering or limiting any of the rights and remedies of the Debtor and the Reorganized Debtor under section 502(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, all of which rights and remedies are hereby reserved, the Debtor and the Reorganized Debtor may, but shall not be required to, withhold (but not setoff except as set forth below) from the distributions called for hereunder on account of any Allowed Claim an amount equal to any Claims, Causes of Action and Litigation Claims of any nature that the Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor may hold against the Holder of any such Allowed Claim; provided , that at least ten (10) days prior to effectuating such withholding, the Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, shall provide written notice thereof to the applicable Holder of such Claim, and all objections and defenses of such Holder to such withholding are preserved. In the event that any such Claims or Causes of Action are adjudicated by Final Order or otherwise resolved against the applicable Holder, the Debtor and the Reorganized Debtor may, pursuant to section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code or applicable non-bankruptcy law, set off against any Allowed Claim and the distributions to be made pursuant hereto on account of such Allowed Claim (before any distribution is made on account of such Allowed Claim), the amount of such adjudicated or resolved Claims or Causes of Action. Neither the failure to effect such a setoff nor the allowance of any Claim hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release by the Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor of any such Claims or Causes of Action, all of which are reserved unless expressly released or compromised pursuant to this Plan or the Combined Order. 
 Article V. PROCEDURES FOR RESOLVING CONTINGENT, UNLIQUIDATED AND DISPUTED CLAIMS 

A. Resolution of Disputed Claims 

1. Allowance of Claims 

After the Effective Date, and except as otherwise provided in this Plan, the Reorganized Debtor shall have and shall retain any and all available rights and defenses that the Debtor had with respect to any Claim, including, without limitation, the right to assert any objection to Claims based on the limitations imposed by section 502 or section 510 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtor and the Reorganized Debtor may contest the amount and validity of any Disputed or contingent or unliquidated Claim in the ordinary course of business in the manner and venue in 
 	 42 

which such Claim would have been determined, resolved, or adjudicated if the Chapter 11 Case had not been commenced. 
 2. Disallowance of Certain Claims 

Any Holders of Claims disallowed pursuant to section 502(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, unless and until expressly Allowed pursuant to this Plan, shall not receive any distributions on account of such Claims until such time as such Causes of Action against that Holder have been settled or a Final Order of the Bankruptcy Court with respect thereto has been entered and all sums due, if any, to the Debtor by that Holder have been turned over or paid to the Reorganized Debtor. 
 3. Prosecution of Objections to Claims 

After Confirmation but before the Effective Date, the Debtor, and after the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtor, in each case, shall have the authority to File objections to Claims (other than Claims that are Allowed under this Plan) and settle, compromise, withdraw or litigate to judgment objections to any and all such Claims, regardless of whether such Claims are in an Unimpaired Class or otherwise; provided that this provision shall not apply to Professional Fee Claims, which may be objected to by any party-in-interest in the Chapter 11 Case. From and after the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtor may settle or compromise any Disputed Claim without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court. The Reorganized Debtor shall have the sole authority to administer and adjust the Claims Register and its books and records to reflect any such settlements or compromises without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court. 
 4. Claims Estimation 

After Confirmation but before the Effective Date, the Debtor, and after the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtor, may at any time request that the Bankruptcy Court estimate any Disputed Claim or contingent or unliquidated Claim pursuant to applicable law, including, without limitation, section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, and the Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1334 to estimate any such Claim, whether for allowance or to determine the maximum amount of such Claim, including during the litigation concerning any objection to any Claim or during the pendency of any appeal relating to any such objection. All of the aforementioned Claims objection, estimation and resolution procedures are cumulative and not exclusive of one another. Claims may be estimated and subsequently compromised, settled, withdrawn, or resolved by any mechanism approved by the Bankruptcy Court. The rights and objections of all parties are reserved in connection with any such estimation. 
 Notwithstanding section 502(j) of the Bankruptcy Code, in no event shall any Holder of a Claim that has been estimated pursuant to section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise be entitled to seek reconsideration of such estimation unless such Holder has Filed a motion requesting the right to seek such reconsideration on or before fourteen (14) calendar days after the date on which such Claim is estimated. All of the aforementioned Claims and objection, estimation, and resolution procedures are cumulative and not exclusive of one another. 
 	 43 

5. No Filings of Proofs of Claim 

Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, Holders of Claims will not be required to File a Proof of Claim, and except as provided in this Plan, no parties should File a Proof of Claim. The Debtor does not intend to object in the Bankruptcy Court to the allowance of Claims Filed; provided that the Debtor and the Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, reserve the right to object to any Claim that is entitled, or deemed to be entitled, to a distribution under this Plan or is rendered Unimpaired under this Plan. Instead, the Debtor intends to make distributions, as required by this Plan, in accordance with the books and records of the Debtor. Unless disputed by a Holder of a Claim, the amount set forth in the books and records of the Debtor will constitute the amount of the Allowed Claim of such Holder. If any such Holder of a Claim disagrees with the Debtor s books and records with respect to the Allowed amount of such Holder s Claim, such Holder must so advise the Debtor in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of any distribution on account of such Holder s Claim, in which event the Claim will become a Disputed Claim. The Debtor intends to attempt to resolve any such disputes consensually or through judicial means outside the Bankruptcy Court. Nevertheless, the Debtor may, in its discretion, File with the Bankruptcy Court (or any other court of competent jurisdiction) an objection to the allowance of any Claim or any other appropriate motion or adversary proceeding with respect thereto. All such objections will be litigated to Final Order; provided that the Debtor may compromise, settle, withdraw, or resolve by any other method approved by the Bankruptcy Court any objections to Claims. 
 B. Adjustment to Claims Without Objection 

Any Claim that has been paid or satisfied, or any Claim that has been amended or superseded, may be adjusted on the Claims Register by the Reorganized Debtor without a Claims objection having to be Filed and without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court. 
 C. No Distributions Pending Allowance 

If an objection to a Claim is Filed, no payment or distribution provided under this Plan shall be made on account of such Claim unless and until such Disputed Claim becomes an Allowed Claim. 
 D. Distributions on Account of Disputed Claims Once They Are Allowed and Additional Distributions on Account of Previously Allowed Claims 

The Reorganized Debtor or other applicable Distribution Agent shall make distributions on account of any Disputed Claim that has become Allowed after the Effective Date at such time that such Claim becomes Allowed (or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter). Such distributions will be made pursuant to the applicable provisions of Article VII of this Plan. 
 E. No Interest 

Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein or by order of the Bankruptcy Court, postpetition interest shall not accrue or be paid on Claims, and no Holder of a Claim shall be entitled to interest accruing on or after the Petition Date on any Claim or right. Additionally, and 
 	 44 

without limiting the foregoing, interest shall not accrue or be paid on any Disputed Claim with respect to the period from the Effective Date to the date a distribution is made on account of such Disputed Claim, if and when such Disputed Claim becomes an Allowed Claim.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Releasing Party expressly waives any and all rights conferred upon it by any statute or rule of law which provides that a release does not extend to claims which the claimant does not know or suspect to exist in its favor at the time of providing the release, which if known by it may have materially affected its settlement with the released party. The Releases contained in this Plan are effective regardless of whether those released matters are presently known, unknown, suspected, or unsuspected, foreseen, or unforeseen. 
 D. Discharge of Claims and Equity Interests

Such discharge shall void any judgment obtained against the Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor at any time, to the extent that such judgment relates to a discharged Claim.

 	 49 

property, or Estate; (b) all Claims and Equity Interests shall be satisfied, discharged, and released in full, and the Debtor s liability with respect thereto shall be extinguished completely without further notice or action; and (c) all Entities shall be precluded from asserting against the Debtor, the Estate, the Reorganized Debtor, each of their respective successors and assigns, and each of their respective assets and properties, any such Claims or Equity Interests, whether based upon any documents, instruments or any act or omission, transaction, or other activity of any kind or nature that occurred prior to the Effective Date or otherwise.

The Exculpated Party has acted in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code with regard to the solicitation of votes on this Plan and, therefore, are not, and will not be, liable at any time for the violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation governing the solicitation of acceptances or rejections of this Plan or distributions made pursuant to this Plan. The Exculpation will be in addition to, and not in limitation of, all other releases, indemnities, exculpations, and any other applicable law or rules protecting such Exculpated Party from liability. 
 F. Permanent Injunction 

The Combined Order shall permanently enjoin the commencement or prosecution by any Person, whether directly, derivatively, or otherwise, of any Claims, obligations, suits, judgments, damages, demands, debts, rights, Causes of Action, losses, or liabilities released pursuant to this Plan, including the Claims, obligations, suits, judgments, damages, demands, debts, rights, Causes of Action, and liabilities released or exculpated in this Plan or the Combined Order. 
 No Person or Entity may commence or pursue a Claim or Cause of Action, as applicable, of any kind against the Debtor, the Reorganized Debtor, the Exculpated Party,
