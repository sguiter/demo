 shares of our common stock were originally authorized for the granting of awards under the 2012 Incentive Plan. In 2015, our shareholders approved an amendment to the 2012 Incentive Plan, to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance by shares. On May 5, 2021, our shareholders approved the Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Incentive Plan, which among other amendments, increased the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance by shares and extended the term of the 2012 Incentive Plan to March 3, 2026. The number of shares available for awards, as well as the terms of outstanding awards, are subject to adjustment as provided in the Amended and Restated 2012 Incentive Plan for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and other similar events. 
 
 Stock Options 
 
 Our outstanding stock options include time-based stock options, which vest over differing periods of time ranging from the date of issuance to up to months from the option grant date, and performance-based stock options, which have already vested upon achieving operating income margins of , and percent as reported in four of five consecutive quarters over the term of the options. 
 
 Granted Forfeited or canceled Exercised Options outstanding at September 30, 2024 
 
 There was share-based compensation expense for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to the grants described above. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding and exercisable stock options to purchase shares of common stock was million. At December 31, 2023, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding and exercisable options to purchase shares of common stock was million. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, shares of common stock were issued upon the exercise of stock options. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options at an average exercise price of per share. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was million and the Company recognized million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options.

Table of Contents 

Granted Forfeited ) Issued ) Restricted Stock Units outstanding at September 30, 2024 
 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we granted RSUs under the 2012 Incentive Plan to the Board of Directors, executive officers and other employees, which were comprised of time-based RSUs, and adjusted EBITDA performance-based RSUs. The time-based RSUs were issued with a weighted-average grant date fair value of per share and vest in monthly installments over a period from the grant date or in annual installments over a period from the grant date. The adjusted EBITDA performance-based RSUs were issued with a weighted-average grant date fair value of per share and vest upon achieving adjusted EBITDA targets and maintaining those targets over a four-quarter period from the grant date. 
 
 Share-based compensation expense related to time-based RSUs for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was approximately million and million, respectively. Share-based compensation expense related to time-based RSUs for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was approximately million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to the grants described above, excluding incentive awards discussed below, was million and million, respectively. The remaining compensation expense is expected to be recognized over the weighted average period of approximately years. 
 
 Share-based compensation expense related to performance-based RSUs for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was million and million, respectively. Share-based compensation expense related to performance-based RSUs for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was million and million, respectively. Should we attain all the metrics related to performance-based RSU grants, we would recognize up to million of potential share-based compensation expense. We currently expect to recognize an additional million of that potential share-based compensation expense. 
 
 and shares for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated as common share repurchases for accounting purposes, as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These shares do not count against the authorized capacity under the repurchase program described above.

 business segments (Asia, Europe, North America, and Latin America and Other) based primarily upon the geographic region where each segment operates, as well as the internal organization of our officers and their responsibilities. The geographic segments operate under the Nature s Sunshine Products and Synergy WorldWide brands. The Latin America and Other segment includes our wholesale business in which we sell products to various locally-managed entities independent of the Company that we have granted distribution rights for in the relevant market. 
 
 Net sales for each segment have been reduced by intercompany sales as they are not included in the measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by the chief executive officer. We evaluate performance based on contribution margin by segment before consideration of certain inter-segment transfers and expenses.

 percent and percent, respectively, compared with a U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 percent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before income taxes was percent and percent, respectively, compared with a U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 percent. 
 
 The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributed to operations in foreign countries which are treated as a branch for US tax purposes and current year foreign losses that presently do not provide future tax benefit, partially offset by foreign tax credits. 
 
 The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributed to adjustments relating to operations in foreign countries which are treated as a 
 branch for US tax purposes as well as recording a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets which are expected to expire 
 before utilization. 
 
 The difference between the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023, was primarily caused by a decrease in the utilization of foreign tax credits in the current period. 
 
 Our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2020 through 2022 are open to examination for federal tax purposes. We have several foreign tax jurisdictions with open tax years from 2018 through 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had accrued million and million, respectively, related to unrecognized tax positions net of offsetting tax attributes. 
 
 Interim income taxes are based on an estimated annualized effective tax rate applied to the respective quarterly periods, adjusted for discrete tax items in the period in which they occur. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which we make such a determination.

 million and million, respectively, related to the estimated outcome of these proceedings. In addition, we are a party to other litigation where there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, but either the losses are not considered to be probable or we cannot at this time estimate the loss, if any; therefore, provision for losses has been provided. We believe future payments related to these matters could range from to approximately million.

 million and million, respectively, related to non-income tax contingencies. While we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine contingent liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined.

 of purchase if they are not satisfied with the product. In some of our markets, the requirements to return products are more restrictive. 
 
 Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are reported as a component of net sales. 
 
 Volume incentives and other sales incentives or rebates are a significant part of our direct sales marketing program and represent commission payments made to independent consultants. These payments are designed to provide incentives for reaching higher sales levels. The amount of volume incentive expense recognized is determined based upon the amount of qualifying purchases in a given month and recorded as volume incentive expense. Payments to independent consultants for sales incentives or rebates related to their own purchases are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Some payments for sales incentives are processed daily; while others, including rebates, are calculated monthly based upon qualifying sales. 
 
 Disaggregation of Revenue 
 
 Our products are grouped into principal categories: general health, immune, cardiovascular, digestive, personal care and weight management. We have business segments that are based primarily upon the geographic region where each segment operates. Each of the geographic segments operate under the Nature s Sunshine Products and Synergy WorldWide brands. See Note 7, Segment Information, for further information on our reportable segments and presentation of disaggregated revenue by reportable segment and product category. 
 
 Practical Expedients and Exemptions 
 
 We have made the accounting policy election to treat shipping and handling as a fulfillment activity rather than a promised service under Topic 606.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report, as well as the consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto, and management s discussion and analysis included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and our other reports filed since the date of such Form 10-K. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 We are a natural health and wellness company primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of nutritional and personal care products. We are a Utah corporation with our principal place of business in Lehi, Utah, and sell our products directly to customers and to a sales force of independent consultants who resell our products to consumers. 
 
 Our independent consultants market and sell our products to customers and sponsor other independent consultants who also market our products to customers. Because a significant amount of revenue is generated through the sales of our independent consultants, our revenue can be impacted by the number and productivity of our independent consultants. We seek to motivate and provide incentives to our independent consultants by offering high quality products, product support, training seminars, and financial incentives, among other considerations. 
 
 Eastern Europe 
 
 On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched significant military action against Ukraine. There continues to be sustained conflict and disruption in the region, which is expected to endure for the foreseeable future. Our consultants in our Russia and Other market, a market within our Europe business segment that includes Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and other Common Independent States in the region, continue to operate their independent businesses, albeit at a reduced level than prior to the start of the conflict. We expect that this will continue to impact our business for the foreseeable future. We will continue monitoring the social, political, regulatory and economic environment in Ukraine and Russia, and will consider further actions as appropriate. 
 
 Net sales related to Eastern Europe for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 12.2 million and 41.1 million, respectively, compared to 12.1 million and 41.3 million for the same periods in 2023. Operating income related to Eastern Europe for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.5 million and 2.8 million, respectively, compared to 0.8 million and 1.6 million for the same periods in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Eastern Europe had assets of 8.4 million net of working capital reserves related to inventories. 
 
 More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 Like many other companies, we are facing significant inflationary pressures in the global economy. Our operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by inflation, primarily from higher costs of raw materials, labor, production, distribution and transportation costs. 
 
 Third Quarter Performance 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we experienced an increase in our consolidated net sales of 3.1 percent (or 4.2 percent in local currencies) compared to the same period in 2023. Asia net sales increased approximately 5.9 percent (or 8.6 percent in local currencies) compared to the same period in 2023. Europe net sales increased approximately 4.5 percent (or 2.9 percent in local currencies) compared to the same period in 2023. North America net sales decreased approximately 3.3 percent (or 3.2 percent in local currencies) compared to the same period in 2023. Latin America and Other net sales increased approximately 12.0 percent (or 14.5 percent in local currencies) compared to the same period in 2023. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the local currencies, primarily in our Asian markets, resulted in an approximate 1.1 percent, or 1.3 million, decrease of our net sales during the quarter.

 Cost of sales increased 2.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and as a percentage of net sales were 28.7 percent and 26.9 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cost of sales percentage is primarily due to higher inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange which offset our savings initiatives. 
 
 In absolute terms, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and as a percentage of net sales were 35.7 percent and 37.1 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily related to the streamlining of our global overhead expenses and reduced service fees due to China's lower net sales. 
 
 As an international business, we have significant sales and costs denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We expect foreign markets with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar will continue to represent a substantial portion of our overall sales and related operating expenses. Accordingly, changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect sales and costs or the comparability of sales and costs from period to period as a result of translating foreign markets' financial statements into our reporting currency.

 Net Sales 
 
 International operations have provided, and are expected to continue to provide, a significant portion of our total net sales. As a result, total net sales will continue to be affected by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, in addition to comparing the percent change in net sales from one period to another in U.S. dollars, we present net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. We compare the percentage change in net sales from one period to another period by excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange as shown below. Net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations is not a U.S. GAAP financial measure and removes from net sales in U.S. dollars the impact of changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, by translating the current period net sales into U.S. dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate the net sales for the previous comparable period. We believe presenting the impact of foreign currency fluctuations is useful to investors because it allows a more meaningful comparison of net sales of our foreign operations from period to period. However, net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net sales in U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Throughout the last five years, foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated significantly. See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . 
 
 The following table summarizes the changes in net sales by operating segment with a reconciliation to net sales excluding the impact of currency fluctuations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollar amounts in thousands):

 Consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 114.6 million and 336.2 million, respectively, compared to 111.2 million and 336.4 million for the same period in 2023, which represents an increase of 3.1 percent and a decrease of 0.1 percent, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to product sales increases in our Asia and Europe operating segments. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4.2 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, from the same periods in 2023.

 Asia 
 
 Net sales related to Asia for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 55.3 million and 151.5 million, respectively, compared to 52.2 million and 153.4 million for the same periods in 2023, or an increase of 5.9 percent and a decrease of 1.3 percent, respectively. In local currency, net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 8.6 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Notable activity in the following markets contributed to the results of Asia: 
 
 In our Taiwan market, net sales increased 2.8 million and 4.7 million, or 17.9 percent and 10.2 percent, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currencies, net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 20.4 percent and 14.1 percent, compared to the same periods in 2023. We attribute the growth in net sales primarily to effective execution of fundamentals to improve consultant activity. 
 
 In our South Korea market, net sales decreased 27,000 and 29,000, or 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currency, net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.1 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Net sales continued to show a modest improvement in local currency due to improved customer acquisition. 
 
 In our Japan market, net sales increased 2.9 million and 0.7 million, or 28.1 percent and 2.3 percent, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currencies, net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 34.4 percent and 12.1 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of strong customer acquisition that was bolstered by higher average order values. 
 
 In our China market, net sales decreased 2.4 million and 7.2 million, or 22.3 percent and 21.9 percent, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currencies, net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 23.0 percent and 20.4 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in net sales was primarily the result of challenging macroeconomic factors. 
 
 Europe 
 
 Net sales related to Europe for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 19.6 million and 63.5 million, respectively, compared to 18.8 million and 61.4 million for the same periods in 2023, or increases of 4.5 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively. In local currency, net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.9 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The functional currency for many of these markets is the U.S. Dollar which reduces the effect from foreign currency fluctuations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had favorable impacts on net sales of 0.3 million and 1.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We attribute the increase in net sales in local currency primarily due to the increased focus on our field activation initiatives. 
 
 North America 
 
 Net sales related to North America for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 33.6 million and 103.7 million, respectively, compared to 34.8 million and 104.1 million for the same periods in 2023, or decreases of 3.3 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. In local currency, net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3.2 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 In the United States, net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.9 million and 0.4 million, or 2.8 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower customer acquisition resulting from the near-term impact of the launch of our new digital platform.

 Latin America and Other 
 
 Net sales related to Latin America and Other markets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.1 million compared to 5.4 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 12.0 percent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 net sales remained flat, compared to the same period in 2023, at 17.4 million. In local currency, net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 14.5 percent and decreased 0.8 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Fluctuations in foreign currency had unfavorable impacts on net sales of 0.1 million and favorable impacts of 0.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Further information related to our Asia, Europe, North America, and Latin America and Other business segments is set forth in Note 7 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of sales as a percent of net sales was 28.7 percent and 28.7 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 26.9 percent and 27.8 percent for the same periods in 2023. The increase in cost of sales percentage is primarily due to higher inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange which more than offset our savings initiatives. 
 
 Volume Incentives 
 
 Volume incentives expense as a percent of net sales was 31.0 percent and 30.9 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 30.7 percent and 30.5 percent for the same periods in 2023. The increase was primarily due to the timing of promotional incentives and changes in market mix. These payments are designed to provide incentives for reaching certain sales levels. Volume incentives vary slightly, on a percentage basis, by product due to pricing policies and commission plans in place in our various geographies. We do not pay volume incentives in China, instead we pay independent service fees which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses represent operating expenses, components of which include labor and benefits, sales events, professional fees, travel and entertainment, marketing, occupancy costs, communications costs, bank fees, depreciation and amortization, independent services fees paid in China, and other miscellaneous operating expenses. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.3 million and 6.9 million, respectively, to 41.0 million and 120.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 35.7 percent and 35.8 percent of net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 37.1 percent and 37.8 percent for the same periods in 2023. The decrease was primarily related to the streamlining of our global overhead expenses and reduced service fees due to China's lower net sales. 
 
 Other Income (Loss), Net 
 
 Other income (loss), net, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was income of 2.6 million and 1.4 million, respectively, compared to losses of 0.9 million and 0.5 million during the same periods in 2023, respectively. Other income (loss), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of foreign exchange gains in Asia, partially offset by foreign exchange losses in Latin America, that resulted from net changes in foreign currencies. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before income taxes was 41.2 percent and 35.9 percent, respectively, compared with a U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 percent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before income taxes was 49.2 percent and 43.6 percent, respectively, compared with a U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 percent. 
 
 The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributed to operations in certain foreign countries which are treated as a branch for US tax purposes and current year foreign losses that presently do not provide future tax benefit, partially offset by foreign tax credits. 
 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributed to adjustments relating to operations in foreign countries which are treated as a 
 branch for US tax purposes as well as recording a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets which are expected to expire 
 before utilization. 
 
 The difference between the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023, is primarily caused by a decrease in the utilization of foreign tax credits in the current period. 
 
 Our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2020 through 2022 are open to examination for federal tax purposes. We have several foreign tax jurisdictions that have open tax years from 2018 through 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had accrued 0.7 million and 0.3 million, respectively, related to unrecognized tax positions. 
 
 Product Categories 
 
 Our line of over 800 products includes several different product classifications, such as immune, cardiovascular, digestive, personal care, weight management and other general health products. We purchase herbs and other raw materials in bulk, and after quality control testing, we formulate, encapsulate, tablet or concentrate them, label and package them for shipment. Most of our products are manufactured at our facility in Spanish Fork, Utah. Contract manufacturers produce some of our products in accordance with our specifications and standards. We have implemented quality control procedures to verify that our contract manufacturers have complied with our specifications and standards. 
 
 See Note 7, Segment Information, for a summary of the U.S. dollar amounts from the sale of general health, immune, cardiovascular, digestive, personal care and weight management products for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, by business segment. 
 
 Distribution and Marketing 
 
 We market our products primarily through our network of independent consultants, who market our products to customers through direct selling techniques. We seek to motivate and provide incentives to our independent consultants by offering high quality products and providing independent consultants with product support, training seminars, sales conventions, travel programs and financial incentives. 
 
 Our products sold in the United States are shipped directly from our manufacturing and warehouse facilities located in Spanish Fork, Utah, as well as from our regional warehouses located in Georgia, Ohio, and Texas. Many of our international operations maintain warehouse facilities and inventory to supply their independent consultants. However, in foreign markets where we do not maintain warehouse facilities, we have contracted with third parties to distribute our products and provide support services to our force of independent consultants. 
 
 In the United States, we generally sell our products on a cash or credit card basis. From time to time, our U.S. operations extend short-term credit associated with product promotions. For certain of our international operations, we use independent distribution centers and offer credit terms that are generally consistent with industry standards within each respective country. 
 
 We pay sales commissions, or volume incentives to our independent consultants based upon their own product sales and the product sales of their sales organization. As an exception, in China, we do not pay volume incentives; rather, we pay independent service fees, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. These volume incentives are recorded as an expense in the year earned. The amounts of volume incentives that we expensed during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are set forth in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report. In addition to the opportunity to receive volume incentives, independent consultants who attain certain levels of monthly product sales are eligible for additional incentive programs including automobile allowances, sales convention privileges and travel awards.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our principal use of cash is to pay for operating expenses, including volume incentives, inventory and raw material purchases, capital assets and funding of international expansion. As of September 30, 2024, working capital was 96.4 million, compared to 89.1 million as of December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we had 78.7 million in cash, of which 5.7 million was held in the U.S. and 73.0 million was held in foreign markets and may be subject to various withholding taxes and other restrictions related to repatriation before becoming available to be used along with the normal cash flows from operations to fund any unanticipated shortfalls in future cash flows. 
 
 Our net consolidated cash inflows (outflows) are as follows (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Operating activities 13,114 31,628 Investing activities (8,776) (9,230) Financing activities (9,329) (3,365) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities provided cash of 13.1 million, compared to 31.6 million in the same period in 2023. Operating cash flows decreased primarily due to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities, lease liabilities, prepaid expenses, and timing of receipts of accounts receivable, partially offset by a reduction in inventories. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investing activities used 8.8 million, compared to 9.2 million for the same period in 2023, which consisted of capital expenditures related to the purchase of equipment, computer systems and software. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities used 9.3 million, compared to 3.4 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used cash to repurchase 509,000 shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program for 8.4 million. At September 30, 2024, the remaining balance available for repurchases under the program was 9.2 million. 
 
 We maintain a revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A (the Credit Agreement ), as well as a credit agreement with Banc of America Leasing and Capital, LLC (the "Capital Credit Agreement"). At September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement or the Capital Credit Agreement. Our debt obligations are discussed in greater detail in Note 4, Revolving Credit Facility and Other Obligations, to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1, Part 1 of this report. 
 
 We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including capital expenditures, on both a short- and long-term basis. 
 
 In addition, other things such as a prolonged economic downturn, a decrease in demand for our products, an unfavorable settlement of our unrecognized tax positions or non-income tax contingencies could adversely affect our long-term liquidity. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and form the basis for the following discussion and analysis on critical accounting policies and estimates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates and those differences could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. We have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Board of Directors and our Audit Committee. 
 
 A summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We believe the critical accounting policies and estimates described below reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The impact and any associated risks on our business that are related to these policies are also discussed throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 Our revenue recognition practices are discussed in Note 11, Revenue Recognition, to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1, Part 1 of this report. 
 
 Inventories 
 
 Inventories are adjusted to the lower of cost and net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. The components of inventory cost include raw materials, labor and overhead. To estimate any necessary adjustments, various assumptions are made regarding excess or slow-moving inventories, non-conforming inventories, expiration dates, current and future product demand, production planning and market conditions. If future demand and market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions, additional inventory adjustments could be required. 
 
 Incentive Trip Accrual 
 
 We accrue for expenses associated with our direct sales program, which rewards independent consultants with paid attendance for incentive trips, including our conventions and meetings. Expenses associated with incentive trips are accrued over qualification periods as they are earned. We specifically analyze incentive trip accruals based on historical and current sales trends as well as contractual obligations when evaluating the adequacy of the incentive trip accrual. Actual results could generate liabilities more or less than the amounts recorded. 
 
 Contingencies 
 
 We are involved in certain legal proceedings and disputes. When a loss is considered probable in connection with litigation or non-income tax contingencies and when such loss can be reasonably estimated with a range, we record our best estimate within the range related to the contingency. If there is no best estimate, we record the minimum of the range. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to the contingency and revise the estimates. Revision in estimates of the potential liabilities could materially affect our results of operations in the period of adjustment. Our contingencies are discussed in further detail in Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies , to the Notes of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, of Item 1, Part 1 of this report. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and contingent reserves reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated provision for income taxes. 
 
 Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Valuation allowances are recorded as reserves against net deferred tax assets by us when it is determined that net deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized in the foreseeable future.

Table of Contents 

 Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
 
 The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. 

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We conduct business in several countries and intend to grow our international operations. Net sales, operating income and net income are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling products in more than one currency. In addition, our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in social, political and economic conditions inherent in international operations, including changes in the laws and policies that govern international investment in countries where we have operations, as well as, to a lesser extent, changes in U.S. laws and regulations relating to international trade and investment. For further information, see Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms adopted by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on management s assessment under this framework, management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 In addition to the information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risks discussed under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial statements, results of operations, and cash flows. Additional risks not currently known, or risks that are currently believed to be not material, may also impair business operations. There have been no material changes to our risk factors since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as set forth below. 
 
 System failures or issues with integrating new technology could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Like many companies, our business is highly dependent upon our information technology infrastructure (websites, accounting and manufacturing applications, and product and customer information databases) to manage effectively and efficiently our operations, including order entry, customer billing, accurate tracking of purchases and volume incentives, execution of digital sales, and managing accounting, finance and manufacturing operations. The occurrence of a natural disaster, security breach or other unanticipated problem could result in interruptions in our day-to-day operations that could adversely affect our business. In addition, the integration of new technology or systems, including the redesign of our digital sales platform expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2024, could adversely affect our business, including our sales, our results of operations and our ability to reach customers, as we and our customers and online marketing systems adapt to such new technology and design. A long-term failure or impairment of any of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that we will realize expected benefits as a result of our implementing new technology or systems into our operations, even though investment in such technologies or systems may be significant. 
 
 We conduct business outside of the U.S., which exposes the Company to additional risks not typically associated with companies that operate solely within the U.S. 
 
 A significant part of our operations is in foreign countries. These operations have additional risks, including currency exchange, foreign exchange controls, difficulties and limitations on the repatriation of cash, less developed or efficient financial markets than in the U.S., absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, differences in the legal and regulatory environment and additional compliance burdens, different publicly available information in respect of companies in non-U.S. markets and different or lesser protection of our intellectual property and possible imposition of non-U.S. taxes. Certain geopolitical factors may also affect our business, including uncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in the United States and other governments trade regulations, trade wars, tariffs, other restrictions or other geopolitical events, including the evolving relations between the United States and China. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations.

(1) On March 10, 2021, we announced a 15.0 million common share repurchase program. On March 8, 2022 we announced an amendment to the share repurchase program allowing the repurchase of an additional 30.0 million shares. The repurchases may be made from time to time as market conditions warrant and are subject to regulatory considerations. We purchased 56,000 shares of our common stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, under the terms of this Board approved plan. 
 
 The actual timing, number, and value of common shares repurchased under our board-approved plan will be determined at our discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, general market and business conditions, the trading price of common shares, and applicable legal requirements. We have no obligation to repurchase any common shares under the authorization, and the repurchase plan may be suspended, discontinued, or modified at any time for any reason.
