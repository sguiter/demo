 BKF Capital Group, Inc. (OTCMKTS:BKFG) BKF Capital Group, Inc. (OTCMKTS:BKFG) BKF Capital is a related party. Steven N. Bronson, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, is also the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of BKF Capital. Ryan J. Hoffman, our Chief Financial Officer, is also the Chief Financial Officer of BKF Capital. Mr. Bronson, together with BKF Capital, has a controlling interest in Interlink. We have a facilities agreement with BKF Capital to allow BKF Capital to use a portion of our Irvine, California office facility, for which we have agreed to split substantially all rent and lease-related costs on an apportioned basis according to the approximate relative usage levels by each entity. In addition, we have consulting agreements with BKF Capital for certain of our respective employees and/or independent contractors that provide certain operational and general and administrative services to the other entity. In 2021, we entered into a M A advisory consulting services agreement with Bronson Financial LLC BF ), a wholly owned subsidiary of BKF Capital, pursuant to which BF provided M A advisory consulting services to us. This agreement was terminated in April 2024. Interlink and BKF Capital also agree to reimburse, or be reimbursed by, one another for expenses paid by one company on behalf of the other.

Our income tax expense is impacted by the mix of domestic and foreign pre-tax earnings and losses, permanent differences between book income/loss and taxable income/loss, and our ability to utilize net operating loss carryovers NOLs ). Accordingly, our effective tax rate typically will vary from the U.S. statutory tax rate of from quarter to quarter. The effective tax rates for each of the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were impacted by the amount of our foreign pre-tax income and the tax expense thereon while not realizing a benefit on our domestic pre-tax loss due to the valuation allowance on our domestic NOLs. We experienced an ownership change under IRC Section 382 in 2010. In general, a Section 382 ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by 5 shareholders (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. An ownership change generally affects the rate at which NOLs and potential other deferred tax assets are permitted to offset future taxable income. Certain state jurisdictions within which we operate contain similar provisions and limitations. As of September 30, 2024, all of the remaining federal and state NOLs are subject to annual limitations due to the 2010 ownership change.

 valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets was necessary at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our projections for future profitability. The Internal Revenue Code includes a provision, referred to as Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI ), which provides for a tax on certain income of controlled foreign corporations. We have elected to account for GILTI as a period cost if and when incurred, rather than recognizing deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse. Of our million of cash at September 30, 2024, million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S. or for acquisitions, we have several methods to repatriate the funds without significant tax effects, including repayment of intercompany loans or distributions of previously taxed income. Other distributions may require us to incur U.S. or foreign taxes to repatriate these funds. , and during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was . ROU assets for operating leases are periodically reduced by impairment losses. As of September 30, 2024, we have not recognized any impairment losses for our ROU assets. We monitor for events or changes in circumstances that require a reassessment of our leases. When a reassessment results in the remeasurement of a lease liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the corresponding ROU asset unless doing so would reduce the carrying amount of the ROU asset to an amount less than zero. In that case, the amount of the adjustment that would result in a negative ROU asset balance is recorded in profit or loss. In June 2023, we entered into a lease agreement to lease square feet of office space in Irvine, California for approximately per month for a term commencing June 2023 and ending May 2024.

Our warranty reserves are established at the time of sale and updated throughout the warranty period based upon numerous factors including historical warranty return rates and expenses over various warranty periods. Historically, our warranty returns have not been material. Intellectual Property Indemnities We indemnify certain customers and our contract manufacturers against liability arising from third-party claims of intellectual property rights infringement related to our products. These indemnities appear in development and supply agreements with our customers as well as manufacturing service agreements with our contract manufacturers, are not limited in amount or duration and generally survive the expiration of the contract. Given that the amount of any potential liabilities related to such indemnities cannot be determined until an infringement claim has been made, we are unable to determine the maximum amount of losses that we could incur related to such indemnifications. Director and Officer Indemnities and Contractual Guarantees Pursuant to our bylaws, we will indemnify our directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law, without limitation as to amount or duration, in the event of any actual or threatened lawsuit or proceeding. Certain costs incurred in connection with such indemnifications may be recovered under certain circumstances under various insurance policies. Given that the amount of any potential liabilities related to such indemnities cannot be determined until a lawsuit or proceeding has been threatened or filed, we are unable to determine the maximum amount of losses that we could incur relating to such indemnities. We have entered into an employment agreement with Steven N. Bronson, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. This agreement contains certain severance and change in control obligations. Under the agreement, if Mr. Bronson s employment is terminated due to his death or disability (as such terms are defined in the agreement), Mr. Bronson or his beneficiaries will be entitled to receive: (i) his base compensation to the end of the monthly pay period immediately following the date of termination; (ii) accrued bonus payments; and (iii) immediate and full vesting of all unvested equity and/or options issued by the Company. If Mr. Bronson s employment is terminated by him for good reason (as such term is defined in the agreement), or by us without cause, then Mr. Bronson will be entitled to receive: (i) his base compensation to the date of termination; (ii) a severance payment equal to of his base compensation; (iii) any earned bonus compensation; (iv) employee benefits for twelve months following the date of termination; (v) any vested company match 401(k) or other retirement contribution; and (vi) immediate and full vesting of all unvested equity and/or options issued by the Company. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as such term is defined in the agreement), Mr. Bronson is entitled to receive: (i) a change in control payment in an amount equal to twelve months of his base compensation, payable as of the date the change in control occurs; and (ii) immediate and full vesting of all unvested equity and/or options issued by the Company. Guarantees and Indemnities In the normal course of business, we are occasionally required to undertake indemnification for which we may be required to make future payments under specific circumstances. We review our exposure under such obligations no less than annually, or more frequently as required. The amount of any potential liabilities related to such obligations cannot be accurately determined until a formal claim is filed. Historically, any such amounts that become payable have not had a material negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We maintain general and product liability insurance which may provide a source of recovery to us in the event of an indemnification claim.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words believe, may, will, potentially, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, could, would, project, plan, expect and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q and are subject to uncertainties, assumptions and business and economic risks. As such, our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements as a result of the factors set forth below in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances described in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by law. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect. Overview Interlink Electronics, Inc. is a global sensor and printed electronics company operating in two principal sensor technology divisions: force/touch sensors, and gas and environmental sensors. Our force/touch sensors, including our Force-Sensing Resistor FSR technology and related technologies, and our membrane keypads, graphic overlays and printed electronics are used extensively in Human-Machine Interface HMI devices, while our gas and environmental sensors and instruments are used in environmental and air quality monitoring across a broad range of applications. We design, develop, manufacture and sell a range of technologies that incorporate our proprietary materials technology, firmware and software into a portfolio of standard products and custom solutions. On March 1, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a 50 common stock dividend that was paid on March 22, 2024. For all years presented, all share and per share data have been retroactively adjusted for the effect of the 50 common stock dividend, which is accounted for as a stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend. Our principal products are: Force/Touch Sensors . We design, develop, manufacture and sell a range of force-sensing technologies that incorporate our proprietary materials technology, firmware and software into a portfolio of standard products and custom solutions. These include sensor components, subassemblies, modules and products that support effective, efficient cursor control and novel three-dimensional user inputs. Our HMI technology platforms are deployed in a wide range of markets, including consumer electronics, automotive, industrial and medical. The application of our HMI technology platforms includes vehicle entry, vehicle multi-media control interface, rugged touch controls, presence detection, collision detection, speed and torque controls, pressure mapping, biological monitoring and others. Additionally, through the Calman acquisition in March 2023, which brought us over 25 years of HMI design and manufacturing expertise as a leading provider of specialized printed electronics, we offer customized membrane keypads, graphic overlays, printed electronics and industrial label products for use in a wide range of fields, from industrial instrumentation, process control and monitoring to medical and diagnostic devices and defense systems. Gas and Environmental Sensors . We entered the gas and environmental sensing market in 2022 through our acquisition of the business assets of SPEC Sensors, LLC SPEC and KWJ Engineering, Inc. KWJ ), early pioneers in miniaturized, low-cost gas and environmental sensing technologies. Following our acquisition of these operations, we now offer electrochemical gas-sensing technology products and solutions for industry, community, health and home, with uses in fields such as safety, personal wellness and air quality monitoring. We sell our products and solutions globally to a diverse array of customers that includes Fortune Global 500 companies with the world s most recognizable brands, as well as start-ups, design houses, original design and equipment manufacturers, and universities. Our technology has been deployed in the consumer electronics, automotive, industrial automation, medical, defense and environmental monitoring markets. Our global presence in the United States, China, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore and

 Japan allows us to broadly provide sales and engineering support services to our existing and future worldwide customers. We manufacture our products in a state-of-the-art facility in Shenzhen, China, and in our advanced and proprietary facilities in Silicon Valley, California and Irvine, Scotland. We control 100 of the manufacturing and shipping process, which enables us to respond quickly to customer product demand and design requirements. We have invested significantly in the expansion of our technology platforms through our own internal development to ensure we continue to provide the market with leading-edge solutions that are seamless to deploy and perform flawlessly. Having previously built an R D organization in Singapore to develop new product offerings to meet the market s growing demand for touch technology and smart surfaces, in 2020 we relocated a majority of our R D and product development efforts to Camarillo, California, where we have established a Global Product Development and Materials Science Center. Combined with the advanced and proprietary facilities in Silicon Valley and Scotland that were acquired in connection with the acquisitions of SPEC/KWJ and Calman, we believe this will allow us to grow our business and be more closely aligned with current and future top-tier customers. We also plan to explore potential strategic relationships with companies and technology institutes that will support our growth initiatives. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statements presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected. A description of our critical accounting policies that represent the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements was provided in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 25, 2024. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in the Form 10-K that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements We reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded they are all not applicable or not expected to be material to our financial statements.

We sell our standard products to customers in many markets through various distribution networks. The ultimate customer for our products may come from different markets that are often unknown to us at the time of sale. Each market has different product design cycles. Products with longer design cycles often have much longer product life cycles. Medical, industrial, and environmental monitoring products generally have longer design and life cycles than consumer products. We currently have products with life cycles that have exceeded 20 years and are ongoing.

 Revenues were down in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 for sales to customers in the medical and industrial markets into which we sell our custom products, and also for our standard products, while revenues for sales of our custom products to customers in the consumer market were up marginally. Fluctuations in our revenue result from variations in the trends and timing of shipments of our products which are impacted by fluctuations in customer demand. In the third quarter of 2024, we experienced lower demand from certain of our larger force-sensor customers in the medical and industrial markets compared to the third quarter of 2023, and we also experienced delays in fulfilment of orders from one of our larger customers of our membrane printed electronics products made in our Calman subsidiary. In all markets, the timing of orders from our customers is not always predictable and can be concentrated in varying periods to coincide with our customers project and building plans. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 of of Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Gross profit 1,105 41.4 1,459 47.4 (354) (24.3) Our gross profit and gross margin percentage are impacted by various factors including product mix, customer mix, sales volume, and fluctuations in our cost of revenues, which are comprised of material costs, direct and indirect production labor costs, warehousing and logistics costs, facilities costs, and other costs related to production activities. Gross profit and gross margin percentage were down during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to lower revenues and also in part to changes in product and customer mix. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 of of Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Engineering, research and development 486 18.2 588 19.1 (102) (17.3) Engineering and R D expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses for employees engaged in research, design and development activities, plus the cost of those employees indirect supplies and allocation of facilities expenses. Our R D team focuses both on internal design development in order to develop our products and solutions, and on custom design development aimed at addressing our customers unique design challenges. Engineering and R D costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were down compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreased engineering employee and consultant compensation costs. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 of of Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, general and administrative 1,095 41.0 963 31.3 132 13.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses for sales and administrative employees, legal and other professional fees, facilities expenses, communication expenses, and intangible asset amortization expense. Selling, general and administrative costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were up compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 attributable to increased intangible asset amortization expense due to the Calman acquisition, partly offset by lower sales and administrative compensation expense on lower headcount and lower professional services expenses. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 of of Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Other income (expense), net (19) (0.7) 26 0.8 (45) (173.1)

Table of Contents 
 Other income (expense) consists of non-operating income and expenses, such as gains and losses on marketable securities, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, interest income and expense, and other non-operating income and expenses. Other income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised of 14,000 of interest income, offset by 33,000 of foreign currency transaction losses, while other income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised of 31,000 of interest income, offset by 5,000 of foreign currency transaction losses. Income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income/loss was 5.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 89.4 for the comparable period in the prior year. Our income tax expense is impacted by the mix of domestic and foreign pre-tax earnings and losses, permanent differences between book income/loss and taxable income/loss, and our ability to utilize net operating loss carryovers NOLs ). Accordingly, our effective tax rate typically will vary from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21 from quarter to quarter. The effective tax rates for both of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were impacted by the amount of our foreign pre-tax income and the tax expense thereon while not realizing a benefit on our domestic pre-tax loss due to the valuation allowance on our domestic NOLs. Discrete tax events may cause our effective rate to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Certain events, including, for example, acquisitions and other business changes, which are difficult to predict, may also cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate. We are subject to changing tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions. Corporate tax reform continues to be a priority in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Additional changes to the tax system in the U.S. could have significant effects, positive and negative, on our effective tax rate and on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenue, net, by the markets we serve is as follows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 of of Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) Medical 3,035 34.9 3,871 37.2 (836) (21.6) Industrial 2,019 23.2 3,173 30.5 (1,154) (36.4) Consumer 217 2.5 350 3.4 (133) (38.0) Standard 3,422 39.4 3,008 28.9 414 13.8 Revenue, net 8,693 100.0 10,402 100.0 (1,709) (16.4) Revenues were down in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for sales to customers in the medical, industrial, and consumer markets into which we sell our custom products, while revenues for sales of our standard products were up in the 2024 period compared to the prior year. Fluctuations in our revenue result from variations in the trends and timing of shipments of our products which are impacted by fluctuations in customer demand. During the first nine months of 2024, we experienced lower demand from certain of our larger force-sensor customers in the medical, industrial, and consumer markets compared to the first nine months of 2023, and we also experienced delays in fulfilment of orders from one of our larger customers of our membrane printed electronics products made in our Calman subsidiary. In all markets, the timing of orders from our customers is not always predictable and can be concentrated in varying periods to coincide with our customers project and building plans.

Income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income/loss was 4.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 78.0 for the comparable period in the prior year. Our income tax expense is impacted by the mix of domestic and foreign pre-tax earnings and losses, permanent differences between book income/loss and taxable income/loss, and our ability to utilize net operating loss carryovers NOLs ). The effective tax rates for both of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were impacted by the amount of our foreign pre-tax income and the tax expense thereon while not realizing a benefit on our domestic pre-tax loss due to the valuation allowance on our domestic NOLs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures have historically been funded from cash balances on hand, cash generated from operations, and sales of equity securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 3.8 million, working capital of 6.5 million and no indebtedness. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market funds. Of our 3.8 million of cash, 2.5 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S. or for acquisitions, we have several methods to repatriate without significant tax effects, including repayment of intercompany loans or distributions of previously taxed income. Other distributions may require us to incur U.S. or foreign taxes to repatriate these funds. We have outstanding 200,000 shares of our 8.0 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock that have an aggregate liquidation preference of 5.0 million. We pay, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, monthly cumulative cash dividends on the Preferred Stock at an annual rate of 8.0 ; this is equivalent to 0.16667 per month and 2.00 per annum per share, based on a per share liquidation preference of 25.00. Dividends on the Preferred Stock are payable monthly in arrears on the 15th day of each calendar month. Our Board of Directors has declared, and we have paid, cash dividends on the Preferred Stock each month since the Preferred Stock was issued in October 2021, and we expect that the Board will continue to declare, and we will continue to pay, such cash dividends each month while the Preferred Stock is outstanding, subject to applicable limitations under Nevada law.

 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance will be sufficient to maintain our current operations considering our current financial condition, obligations, and other expected cash flows. If our circumstances change, however, we may require additional cash. If we require additional cash, we may attempt to raise additional capital through equity, equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we could be subject to fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to raise additional needed funds, we may also take measures to reduce expenses to offset any shortfall. Cash Flow Analysis Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are summarized as follows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (144) 155 Net cash (used in) investing activities (107) (4,322) Net cash (used in) financing activities (300) (650) Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 144,000 of cash used in operating activities was attributable to net loss of 1,571,000, adjusted for non-cash charges of 638,000 and cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of 789,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the 155,000 of cash provided by operating activities was attributable to net income of 65,000, adjusted for non-cash charges of 292,000 and offset by cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities of 202,000. Accounts receivable decreased from 2.2 million at December 31, 2023 to 1.2 million at September 30, 2024 due to lower shipments during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Many of our customers pay promptly and the accounts receivable balance is generally related to the most recent shipments. Inventories were unchanged from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 at 2.5 million. Inventory balances fluctuate depending on the timing of materials purchases and product shipments. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased from 381,000 at December 31, 2023 to 243,000 at September 30, 2024 due primarily to the timing of making prepayments versus when the benefits of those prepayments are consumed. Accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and accrued income taxes decreased from 1.2 million at December 31, 2023 to 903,000 at September 30, 2024; the balances of these working capital liabilities fluctuate due to the timing of purchases and payments on inventories and other accruals of employee compensation and outside services. Net Cash (Used In) Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 107,000 of purchases of property, plant, and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities of 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 4.3 million used to acquire the equity interests of Calman (which is net of 1.6 million of cash acquired), and 44,000 of purchases of property, plant, and equipment. Net Cash (Used In) Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities of 300,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of payment of dividends on our Preferred Stock. Net cash used in financing activities of 650,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 350,000 used for repurchases of 56,430 shares of common stock and 300,000 used for payments of dividends on our Preferred Stock.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not Applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The phrase disclosure controls and procedures refers to controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, or CEO, and chief financial officer, or CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decision regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO had concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. In addition, the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and controls may become inadequate if conditions change. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
