 million, effective. The Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Craft Capital Management LLC and EF Hutton LLC (collectively, the Underwriters on August 28, 2024 to conduct the Offering of units (the public units in the amount of million in gross proceeds, with a -day option provided to the Underwriters to purchase up to additional public units solely to cover over-allotments, if any, in the amount of up to million in additional gross proceeds. Each public unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company (a public share ), par value, and one redeemable warrant (a public warrant ). Each public warrant is exercisable for one Class A ordinary share at a price of per full share. On August 30, 2024, the Company consummated the Offering of public units. The public units were sold at a price of per public unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . As further discussed in Note 3, simultaneously with the closing of the Offering, the Company consummated the private placement to certain non-managing investors of Class B ordinary shares (the private placement shares at a price of per share (the private placement ). The private placement generated aggregate gross proceeds of . As further discussed in Note 4, simultaneously with the closing of the Offering, the Company consummated the private placement to the Company s sponsor, GigAcquisitions7 Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company (the Founder or Sponsor ), of warrants (the private placement warrants at a price of per private placement warrant (the warrant private placement ). Each private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at per share, subject to adjustment. The warrant private placement generated aggregate gross proceeds of . Following the closing of the Offering, net proceeds in the amount of from the sale of the public units in the Offering were placed in a trust account Trust Account (discussed below). Transaction costs amounted to , consisting of of underwriting fees and of offering costs, partially offset by the reimbursement of of offering expenses by the Underwriters. The Company s remaining cash after payment of the offering costs is held outside of the Trust Account for working capital purposes. The Trust Account The funds in the Trust Account will be invested only in or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 which invest only in direct U.S. government obligations. Funds will remain in the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the completion of the Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. The remaining proceeds from the Offering outside the Trust Account may be used to pay for business, legal and accounting due diligence expenses on acquisition targets and continuing general and administrative expenses.

of the outstanding public shares if the Company has not completed an initial Business Combination within 21 months from the closing of the Offering or (3) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of the Company s public shares if the Company does not complete its initial Business Combination within the required time period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the Company s pre-business combination activity and related shareholders rights. Business Combination The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Offering, although substantially all of the net proceeds of the Offering are intended to be generally applied toward consummating a Business Combination with (or acquisition of) a Target Business. As used herein, Target Business must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least of the balance in the Trust Account (less the taxes payable on interest earned) at the time the Company signs a definitive agreement in connection with the Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. The Company, after signing a definitive agreement for a Business Combination, will either (i) seek shareholder approval of the Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose in connection with which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the Business Combination, for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable, or (ii) provide shareholders with the opportunity to have their shares redeemed by the Company by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount in cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to commencement of the tender offer, including interest but less taxes payable. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of the Business Combination or will allow shareholders to redeem their shares in a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require the Company to seek shareholder approval unless a vote is required by the Nasdaq rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval, it will complete its Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares are voted in favor of the Business Combination. However, in no event will the Company redeem its public shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than upon consummation of a Business Combination. In such case, the Company would not proceed with the redemption of its public shares and the related Business Combination, and instead may search for an alternate Business Combination. If the Company holds a shareholder vote or there is a tender offer for shares in connection with the Business Combination, a public shareholder will have the right to redeem its shares for an amount in cash equal to its pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable. As a result, such Class A ordinary shares are recorded at the redemption amount and classified as temporary equity. The amount in the Trust Account as of September 30, 2024 was , which represented public shares at per public share plus interest earned on the holdings. The Company will have 21 months from the closing date of the Offering to complete its initial Business Combination. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within this period of time, it shall (i) cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a per share pro rata portion of the Trust Account, including interest, but less taxes payable (less up to of such net interest to pay dissolution expenses) and (iii) as promptly as possible following such redemption, dissolve and liquidate the balance of the Company s net assets to its creditors and remaining shareholders, as part of its plan of dissolution and liquidation. The initial shareholders entered into agreements with the Company, pursuant to which they agreed: (1) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion thereof in connection with the consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination or a tender offer conducted prior to a Business Combination or in connection with it; and (2) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their founder shares and private placement shares if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within 21 months from the closing of this Offering, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they hold if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame.

Offering costs were allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the Offering based on a relative fair value basis, compared to total proceeds received.

The Company granted the Underwriters a -day option to purchase up to additional public units to cover any over-allotments, at the initial public offering price. The option has since expired without the purchase of additional public units by the Underwriters. The Company paid an underwriting discount of per public unit to the Underwriters at the closing of the Offering on August 30, 2024. Simultaneously with the closing of the Offering certain non-managing investors purchased an aggregate of Class B ordinary shares from the Company at the price per share. The private placement shares along with the founder shares collectively represent of the outstanding ordinary shares at the completion of the Offering (excluding any shares underlying the private placement warrants further described in Note 4). The private placement proceeds will be used to pay for business, legal and accounting due diligence expenses on acquisition targets and continuing general and administration expenses. On September 6, 2024, the Company announced that the holders of the Company s public units may elect to separately trade the securities underlying such public units which commenced on September 11, 2024. Any public units not separated will continue to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol GIGGU .

The Founder agreed to forfeit up to Founder Shares to the extent that the over-allotment option is not exercised in full or in part by the Underwriters. As the Underwriters did not exercise the over-allotment option prior to its expiration, the Founder forfeited Founder Shares on October 25, 2024, such that the Founder, the advisor and non-managing investors own of the Company s issued and outstanding Class A and Class B ordinary shares after the Offering.

 References in this report (the Quarterly Report to we, us, our or the Company refer to GigCapital7 Corp. References to our management or our management team refer to our officers and directors, and references to the Founder refer to GigAcquisitions7 Corp. The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 
 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report including, without limitation, statements in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the Company s financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as expect, believe, anticipate, intend, estimate, seek, may, might, plan, possible, potential, should, would and similar words and expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance, but reflect management s current beliefs, based on information currently available. A number of factors could cause actual events, performance or results to differ materially from the events, performance and results discussed in the forward-looking statements. For information identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Risk Factors section of the Company s final prospectus for our initial public offering filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). The Company s securities filings can be accessed on the EDGAR section of the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Overview 
 We are a newly organized Private-to-Public Equity (PPE) company, also known as a blank check company or special purpose acquisition vehicle, incorporated in the Cayman Islands and formed by an affiliate of the serial SPAC GigCapital Global, for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. We have not selected any specific business combination target. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our common equity or any preferred equity that we may create in accordance with the terms of our charter documents, debt, or a combination of cash, common or preferred equity and debt. The public units sold in the initial public offering (the "Offering") each consisted of one Class A ordinary share of the Company and one redeemable warrant. Each public warrant is exercisable for one Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per full share. 
 The issuance of additional ordinary shares or the creation of one or more classes of preferred shares during our initial business combination: 
 may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in the Offering who would not have pre-emption rights in respect of any such issue; 

may subordinate the rights of holders of ordinary shares if the rights, preferences, designations and limitations attaching to the preference shares are senior to those afforded our ordinary shares; 

could cause a change in control if a substantial number of ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 

may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and 

may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our public shares. 

Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant indebtedness, it could result in: 
 default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after our initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 

15 

acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand; 

our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if any document governing such debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; 

our inability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares; 

using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 

limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and 

limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

We expect to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful. 
 Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events 
 We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Offering and to identify a target business for the business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and marketable securities raised during the Offering. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited balance sheet of August 30, 2024 as filed with the SEC on September 6, 2024. We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 610,950, which consisted of operating expenses of 213,755 and other expense from the change in fair value of warrant liability of 165,080, that were partially offset by interest income on cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account and operating account of 989,729 and 56, respectively. 
 For the period from May 8, 2024 (date of inception) to September 30, 2024, we had net income of 546,549, which consisted of operating expenses of 278,157 and other expense from the change in fair value of warrant liability of 165,080, that were partially offset by interest income on cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account and operating account of 989,729 and 57, respectively. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity needs have been satisfied to date through: (1) the receipt of 100,000 from the sale of the founder shares, (2) the net proceeds of 198,680,159 from the sale of the public units in the Offering, after deducting net offering expenses of approximately 1,319,841, which includes an underwriting discount of 600,000, (3) the sale of the founder shares to a consultant for a purchase price of 3,000, (4) the sale of private placement warrants to our Sponsor for a purchase price of 58,060, and (5) the sale of the private placement shares to non-managing investors for a purchase price of 3,250,000. These transactions resulted in proceeds of 202,091,219 of which 200,000,000 will be held in the Trust Account. 
 16 

As of September 30, 2024, we held cash and marketable securities in the amount of 200,989,729 in the Trust Account. The marketable securities consisted of money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 which invest only in direct U.S. government obligations. 
 For the period from May 8, 2024 (date of inception) to September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 528,479, consisting of net income of 546,549 and an increase in liabilities of 277,524, due to increase in accounts payable, including payable to related parties, and accrued liabilities of 112,444, and an increase in the fair value of the warrant liability of 165,080. This increase was offset by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 989,729, plus an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 244,596 and an increase in other assets of 118,227. 
 We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable by us, if any), to acquire a target business or businesses and to pay our expenses relating thereto. We expect the interest earned on the amount in the Trust Account will be sufficient to pay anyincome taxes. To the extent that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 
 To the extent that our ordinary shares are used in whole or in part as consideration to affect our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or finders fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our initial business combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 2,006,512 held outside the Trust Account. If the proceeds not held in the Trust Account become insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 12 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time, we intend to manage our cash flow through the timing and payment of expenses or, if necessary, raise additional funds from the Sponsor to ensure the proceeds not held in the Trust Account will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 12 months. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, the Company may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. Over this time period, we intend to use these funds primarily for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing business due diligence on prospective target businesses, traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses, reviewing corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, selecting the target business to acquire and structuring, negotiating and consummating the business combination. 
 If our estimates of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to consummate our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only consummate such financing simultaneously with the consummation of our initial business combination. Following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 
 17 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay our Founder a monthly fee of 30,000 for office space, administrative services and secretarial support and an agreement with our Chief Financial Officer to pay a monthly fee of 20,000 for accounting services. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when an accounting standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised accounting standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. 
 Net Income Per Ordinary Share 
 The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. The weighted-average ordinary shares are reduced for the effect of the Class B ordinary shares that are subject to forfeiture. The Company s condensed statements of operations and comprehensive income include a presentation of net income per share subject to redemption in a manner similar to the two-class method of income (loss) per share. With respect to the accretion of the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption and consistent with ASC 480-10-S99-3A, the Company deemed the fair value of the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption to approximate the contractual redemption value and the accretion has no impact on the calculation of net income per share. The Company s public warrants and private placement warrants could, potentially, be exercised or converted into Class A ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company. However, these warrants were excluded when calculating diluted income per share as the contingencies associated with the warrants had not been satisfied as of the end of the reporting periods presented. As a result, diluted income per share is the same as basic income per share for the periods presented. 
 
 Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption 
 Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity (deficit). Our Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as 
 18 

temporary equity, outside of the shareholders equity section of our condensed balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, 20,000,000 shares of Class A ordinary shares were issued and outstanding and subject to possible redemption. 
 Warrant Liability 
 We account for warrants for ordinary shares of the Company that are not indexed to our own shares as liabilities at fair value on the condensed balance sheet. These warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other income (expense) on the condensed statement of operations and comprehensive income. We will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the exercise or expiration of the warrants. At that time, the portion of the warrant liability related to the warrants for ordinary shares will be reclassified to additional paid-in capital. 
 Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. The funds held in the Trust Account are only to be invested in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During our most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us or any of our officers or directors in their corporate capacity. 
 Ite m 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report include the risk factors described in our final prospectus for our Offering filed with the SEC on August 29, 2024. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our final prospectus for our Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC. 
 Ite m 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Founder and Consulting Shares 
 During the period from May 8, 2024 (date of inception) to September 30, 2024, the Founder purchased a net 12,207,246 Class B ordinary shares (the Founder Shares ), of which an additional 2,000,000 Class B ordinary shares were forfeited on October 25, 2024 following the Underwriters decision not to exercise the over-allotment option, for an aggregate purchase price of 100,000, or 0.00819186 per share. Additionally, on June 6, 2024, 300,000 Class B ordinary shares were sold for 3,000 to a consultant for its consulting services in connection with the Offering. 
 The shares issued to the Founder and consultant were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Each holder of the Founder Shares is an accredited investor as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act. 
 Private Placement Shares 
 Certain institutional investors (none of which are affiliated with any member of management, our Founder or any other investor) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 2,826,087 Class B ordinary shares at a price of 1.15 per share in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the completion of the Offering. 
 The private placement shares were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The institutional investors are each an accredited investor as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act. 
 Private Placement Warrants 
 The Founder purchased from the Company an aggregate of 3,719,000 private placement warrants, at a price of 0.01561 per private placement warrant in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the completion of the Offering. Each whole private placement warrant will be exercisable for 11.50 per share, and the exercise price of the private placement warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances as described in Note 5 of the accompanying Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements. Under the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to file a new registration statement under the Securities Act, following the completion of the Company s business combination. 
 The private placement warrants were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Founder is an accredited investor as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act. 
 Use of Proceeds 
 On August 28, 2024, the SEC declared the Company s initial Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No 333-280015), in connection with the Offering of 200.0 million, effective. 
 The Company entered into an underwriting agreement on August 28, 2024 to conduct the Offering of 20,000,000 public units in the amount of 200.0 million in gross proceeds (the "public units"), with a 45-day option provided to the underwriters to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional public units solely to cover over-allotments, if any, in the amount of up to 30.0 million in additional gross 
 20 

proceeds. Each public unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, 0.0001 par value, and one redeemable warrant (a public warrant ). Each whole public warrant is exercisable for one Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per full share. 
 On August 30, 2024, the Company consummated the Offering of 20,000,000 public units. The public units were sold at a price of 10.00 per public unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 200,000,000. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 2,006,512 held outside the Trust Account for working capital purposes.
