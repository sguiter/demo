Sales of products sold through e-commerce channels decreased by 1.6) million, or (13.3 ), compared to the first quarter of the prior year. Lower sales in the e-commerce channel were driven by softer consumer demand.

 Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was 21.5 , compared to 19.5 for the prior year quarter, an increase of 200 basis points bps ).

Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Agreement also provides for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to 5 million which, upon issuance, would be deemed advances under the revolving line of credit. Proceeds of borrowings were used to refinance all indebtedness owed to a prior lender and for working capital purposes. The Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all its assets, excluding real property.

In addition, the Loan Agreement places restrictions on the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, to 
 14 

create liens or other encumbrances, to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, and to merge or consolidate with other entities. As of September 30, 2024, management believes the Company was in compliance with all covenants. 
 On April 18, 2022, the Company, as the borrower, entered into a first amendment to the September 8, 2021, Credit Agreement First Amendment to the Credit Agreement ), with the Lender and the lenders thereto. The amendment to the Credit Agreement changed the definition of the term Payment Conditions and further defined default or event of default and the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.

 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 General Market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument, derivative or non-derivative, caused by fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. As discussed below, management of the Company does not believe that changes in these factors could cause material fluctuations in the Company s results of operations or cash flows. The ability to import furniture products can be adversely affected by political issues in the countries where suppliers are located, as well as disruptions associated with shipping distances and negotiations with port employees. Other risks related to furniture product importation include government imposition of regulations and/or quotas; duties, taxes or tariffs on imports; and significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Any of these factors could interrupt supply, increase costs, and decrease earnings. 
 Foreign Currency Risk During the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have sales but did have purchases and other expenses denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Mexican Peso. The wages of our employees and certain other employee benefits and indirect costs related to our operations in Mexico are made in Pesos and subject to foreign currency fluctuation with the U.S. dollar. The Company does not employ any foreign currency hedges against this exposure. A negative shift in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Peso could increase the cost of our manufactured product. See Risk Factors in Item 1A in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. 
 Interest Rate Risk The Company s primary market risk exposure regarding financial instruments is changes in interest rates. On September 30, 2024, the Company had 3.6 million outstanding on its line of credit, exclusive of fees and letters of credit. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Cautionary Statement Relevant to Forward-Looking Information for Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 
 The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements concerning long-term goals or anticipated results of the Company, including statements contained in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and its reports to stockholders. 
 15 

Statements, including those in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which are not historical or current facts, are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There are certain important factors that could cause the Company s results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made herein. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty. Some of the factors that could affect results are the cyclical nature of the furniture industry, supply chain disruptions, litigation, restructurings, the effectiveness of new product introductions and distribution channels, the product mix of sales, pricing pressures, the cost of raw materials and fuel, changes in foreign currency values, retention and recruitment of key employees, actions by governments including laws, regulations, taxes and tariffs, the amount of sales generated and the profit margins thereon, competition (both U.S. and foreign), credit exposure with customers, participation in multi-employer pension plans, disruptions or security breaches to business information systems, the impact of any future pandemic, and general economic conditions. For further information regarding these risks and uncertainties, see the Risk Factors section in Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The Company specifically declines to undertake any obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statements that have been made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
