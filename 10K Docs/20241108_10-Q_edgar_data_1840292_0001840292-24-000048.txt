Liquidity and Going Concern 
 These financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. This basis of accounting contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had liquidity of million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and no debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of million and used cash in operations of million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses and have significant cash outflows from operating activities for at least the next few years. Based on these factors, the Company anticipates that it may not have sufficient resources to fund its cash obligations for the next 12 months after the issuance date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 The Company has evaluated the conditions discussed above and is taking various steps in an effort to alleviate them. The Company is exploring various cost saving opportunities and intends to continue seeking opportunities to generate additional revenue through its commercialization of engineering services. The Company has also engaged a financial advisor and is actively assessing various avenues to secure additional capital, including, but not limited to, the issuance of debt, equity or both. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company.

 Manufacturing Facility Closure 
 As discussed in Note 1 Organization and Basis of Presentation Liquidity and Going Concern , on May 16, 2024, the Company made the strategic decision to implement a targeted plan, which included a workforce reduction, the closing of its Manufacturing Facility and a reduction in third-party costs. Costs and charges related to the implementation of the Company s targeted plan, are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable or at the time of program announcement. The Company expects to incur the costs associated with its targeted plan over the remainder of 2024 and possibly into the first quarter of 2025, however the ultimate amount and timing of total costs and charges in connection with the Company s targeted plan may vary due to a variety of factors, including the finalization of the closure of the Manufacturing Facility and continued sales of property, plant and equipment located at the Manufacturing Facility. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, management concluded that these actions constituted a triggering event and as a result, we performed an impairment assessment for our long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets. During the second quarter of 2024, we recorded impairments of million to property, plant and equipment related to leasehold improvements, machinery and equipment and other fixed assets located at our Manufacturing Facility. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we recorded severance costs of million related to employee transition, severance and related benefits, primarily associated with the workforce reduction mentioned above.

 million associated with closing our Manufacturing Facility. We estimate that we could incur between million to million of costs associated with closing the Manufacturing Facility, including lease termination costs and other related costs, over the remainder of 2024 and possibly into the first quarter of 2025. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the reorganization costs liability decreased to million due to payments made during the three months ended September 30, 2024, associated with closing our Manufacturing Facility. The reorganization costs liability is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 During the first quarter of 2023, we assessed our goodwill for impairment due to a sustained decrease in the Company s market capitalization. The Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit was less than its carrying amount as of March 31, 2023. As a result, we fully impaired goodwill and recorded an impairment of million during the first quarter of 2023. 
 Reorganization Costs 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded additional severance costs of million related to employee severance and related benefits. In October 2024, we initiated additional workforce reductions which resulted in severance costs of approximately million for employee severance and related benefits. 
 In February 2023, the Company initiated a strategic plan to respond to market feedback, streamline our operations, and improve our financial condition. As a result, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded severance costs of million and million, respectively, for employee severance and related benefits. 

thousand and thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The income tax provision was thousand and thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Any income tax benefit associated with the pre-tax loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, resulting primarily from the U.S. jurisdiction, is offset by a full valuation allowance. 
 The Company is under audit by the Internal Revenue Services for the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.

 The following management s discussion and analysis MD A provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included in the fore-part in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (our Quarterly Report and included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our Annual Report ), as filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024. 
 The following MD A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part I Item 1 in this Quarterly Report and our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report. 
 
 Overview 
 Heliogen, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Heliogen, the Company, we, us, or our is a leader in next generation concentrated solar energy. We are developing a modular, artificial intelligence enabled, concentrated solar energy plant that uses an array of mirrors to reflect sunlight and capture, concentrate, store and convert it into cost-effective energy on demand. Our product offering will deliver industrial process steam or power, dispatchable around the clock using thermal energy storage based on proven technology. Our next-generation system will be able to cost-effectively generate and store thermal energy at very high temperatures, enabling more cost-effective production of electricity at a smaller scale. The inclusion of a thermal energy storage system distinguishes our solution from clean energy provided by typical photovoltaic and wind installations which do not produce thermal energy and are only able to produce energy intermittently unless battery storage is added. The system will be configurable for several applications, including carbon-free industrial-grade heat and steam (for use in industrial processes), and clean power (electricity) for a variety of applications, based on a customer s needs. 
 Recent Developments 
 In May 2024, we implemented a targeted plan, which included a workforce reduction, the closing of our manufacturing facility in Long Beach, California, (the Manufacturing Facility and a reduction in third-party costs. These actions are intended to further reduce structural costs and operating expenses and better align our operating structure for commercialization with a technology-centric and capital light model, as we continue to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives with our third-party financial advisor. 
 We estimate that we could incur the following charges in connection with the targeted plan; 0.2 million to 2.0 million of costs associated with closing the manufacturing facility, including lease termination costs and other related costs, in addition to the 3.4 million of asset impairment charges and 0.6 million of employee transition, severance payments and related benefits that were incurred during the second quarter of 2024. We have incurred 4.2 million of these costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were recorded as impairment and other charges on our consolidated statements of operations. We expect to incur the remainder of these costs through the end of 2024 and possibly into the first quarter of 2025. Refer to Note 12 Impairment and Other Charges Manufacturing Facility Closure for additional information. 
 
 How We Generate Revenue 
 We primarily generate revenue by contracting with owner-operators to build turnkey facilities that deploy Heliogen s technology. Our services revenue which is derived from customer contracts, is primarily recognized over time using the incurred costs method for our contracts with customers that include projects under development and engineering and design services. Engineering service contracts can be short-term or span several years and we recognize revenue over time as customers receive and consume the benefit of such services. Additionally, we have government grants which are accounted for as grant revenue and are recognized only when there is reasonable assurance that the entity will comply with any conditions attached to the grant and the grant funds will be received.

 Cost of Conducting Our Business 
 Cost of revenue consists primarily of direct material, labor and subcontractor costs related to our revenue contracts. Additionally, we have indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools and allocated depreciation.

 Revenue and Gross Loss 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized total revenue of 1.1 million, a decrease of 1.2 million compared to total revenue of 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We recognized services revenue of 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.7 million compared to services revenue of 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in services revenue is primarily due to a reduction in revenue recognized on the engineering, procurement and construction of a 5 MWe concentrated solar energy facility to be built in Mojave, California (the Capella Project during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting from a decrease in the cost incurred on the project. 
 We recognized grant revenue of 0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.6 million compared to grant revenue of 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by a decrease in reimbursable costs incurred on the Capella Project under the award (the DOE Award received from the U.S. Department of Energy (the DOE for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized R D expense of 4.5 million, a decrease of 0.7 million compared to R D expense of 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of 1.7 million in employee compensation primarily due to headcount reductions, partially offset by an increase in other R D costs associated with the construction of our steam plant, located in Plains, Texas (the Texas Steam Plant ). 
 Other Income, Net 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized other income of 0.2 million, a decrease of 0.5 million compared to other income of 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of 0.8 million in accretion income related to our investments in available-for-sale securities, which was partially offset by a cash prize award of 0.2 million received for our heliostats during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Revenue and Gross Loss 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized total revenue of 4.8 million, a decrease of 0.8 million compared to total revenue of 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We recognized services revenue of 2.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.7 million compared to services revenue of 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in services revenue is primarily due to a reduction in revenue recognized on the Capella Project during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting from a decrease in the cost incurred on the project, which was partially offset by an increase in engineering services performed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We recognized grant revenue of 2.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.1 million compared to grant revenue of 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by a decrease in reimbursable costs incurred on the Capella Project under the DOE Award, which was partially offset by the approval of the proposed budget modification by the DOE for the Capella Project, which did not change the DOE Award amount but resulted in more favorable cost sharing ratios and indirect rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gross loss of 1.7 million, a change of 1.5 million compared to gross loss of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily driven by an inventory reserve of 1.7 million recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to adjust for excess and obsolete inventories based on our current future project needs. The decrease was partially offset by the recognition of a contract loss provision during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 0.1 million primarily related to our German operations.

The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of 6.5 million in professional and consulting fees as we focused on reducing third-party costs, a decrease of 6.0 million in employee compensation primarily driven by headcount reductions, a decrease of 1.5 million in Collaboration Warrants because they were fully impaired in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 1.6 million in other SG A expense as we focused on reducing discretionary spending. The decrease was partially offset by a 9.8 million increase in share-based compensation primarily due to a one-time reversal of share-based compensation of 12.5 million during the first quarter of 2023, as a result of stock options forfeited in connection with the termination of our former Chief Executive Officer.

The decrease was driven by a decrease of 3.5 million in employee compensation primarily due to headcount reductions and a decrease of 0.8 million in share-based compensation expense due to forfeitures, partially offset by an increase in other R D costs associated with the construction of our Texas Steam Plant. 
 Impairment and Other Charges 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized impairment and other charges of 4.4 million, consisting of 3.4 million to property, plant and equipment related to leasehold improvements, machinery and equipment and other fixed assets located at our Manufacturing Facility, 0.8 million of employee severance and related benefits associated with workforce reductions and 0.2 million of reorganization costs associated with closing our Manufacturing Facility. Refer to Note 12 Impairment and Other Charges for additional information. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized impairment and other charges of 1.6 million, consisting of an impairment charge of 1.0 million to fully impair goodwill due to a sustained decrease in our market capitalization and 0.6 million expense for employee severance and related benefits.

 Interest Income, Net 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized interest income of 1.9 million, an increase of 1.0 million compared to interest income of 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment for our investments, partially offset by the decrease in our average investment balance. 
 Other Income, Net 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized other income of 0.5 million, a decrease of 0.8 million compared to other income of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of 2.5 million in accretion income related to our investments in available-for-sale securities, partially offset by a gain of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of HelioHeat GmbH based on the revised probability of payment, which was partially offset by a cash prize award of 0.2 million received for our heliostats during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and investments on hand, which are short-term in duration and highly liquid, and cash receipts from customers and government grants. Our principal uses of cash are expenditures related to project development and completion, as well as R D and SG A expenditures in support of our technology development and operational support. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had liquidity of 44.6 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and no debt. As of November 4, 2024, the Company had liquidity of 40.7 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and no debt. 
 Going Concern 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2024, our liquidity was 44.6 million and we had an accumulated deficit of 484.5 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 46.3 million and used cash in operations of 31.1 million. We expect to continue to generate operating losses and have significant cash outflows from operating activities for at least the next few years. Based on our liquidity position as of September 30, 2024 and our current forecast of operating results and cash flows, we anticipate that we may not have sufficient resources to fund our cash obligations for the next 12 months after the issuance date of this Quarterly Report. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 We have evaluated the conditions discussed above and we are taking various steps in an effort to alleviate them. We are exploring various cost saving opportunities and intend to continue seeking opportunities to generate additional revenue through our commercialization of engineering services. We have also engaged a financial advisor and we are actively assessing various avenues to secure additional capital, including, but not limited to, the issuance of debt, equity or both. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. If we are unable to effectively implement additional cost reductions, generate additional revenue or raise additional funding, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our commercialization efforts, product expansion or R D programs and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Assuming no additional funding and based on our current operating and development plans, we expect that existing liquidity as of the date of this filing will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated operating expenses into the second half of 2025. 
 On May 16, 2024, the Company made the strategic decision to implement a targeted plan, which included a workforce reduction, the closing of the Manufacturing Facility, and a reduction in third-party costs. These actions are intended to further reduce structural costs and operating expenses and better align the Company s operating structure for commercialization with a technology-centric and capital light model, as the Company continues to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives with its third-party financial advisor.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, and as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in our Annual Report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than executing upon the implementation of the remediation measures described in our Annual Report and the associated changes to our internal control over financial reporting, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
