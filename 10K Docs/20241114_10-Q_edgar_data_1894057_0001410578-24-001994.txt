The Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity from October 8, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024, relates to the Company s formation and Initial Public Offering IPO ), which is described below and, since the IPO, the search for a prospective Business Combination.

The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income earned on investments from the proceeds derived from the IPO held in the Trust Account (defined below). The registration statement for the Company s IPO was declared effective on January 13, 2022. On January 19, 2022, the Company consummated the IPO of units Units ), including shares of Class A common stock in the Units offered (the Public Shares ), at per Unit, generating gross proceeds of , which is discussed in Note 3. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of private placement units Private Placement Units at a price of per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to the Company s sponsor, Papaya Growth Opportunity I Sponsor, LLC (the Sponsor ), Cantor Fitzgerald Co. Cantor ), and J.V.B. Financial Group, LLC on behalf of its Cohen Company Capital Markets division CCM ), generating gross proceeds of which is described in Note 4. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units, the Company consummated the sale of additional Units upon receiving notice of the underwriter s election to fully exercise its overallotment option Overallotment Units ), generating additional gross proceeds of . Simultaneously with the exercise of the overallotment, the Company consummated the private placement of an additional Private Placement Units to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of . Offering costs for the IPO and sale of the Private Placement Units and Overallotment Units amounted to , consisting of of upfront underwriting fees, of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in the Trust Account), and of other offering costs. As described in Note 6, the of deferred underwriting fees payable is contingent upon the consummation of a Business Combination by January 19, 2025, from the closing of the IPO, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Following the closing of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units and Overallotment Units, per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO, Overallotment Units, and the Private Placement Units was placed in a trust account Trust Account ).

 of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. The Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). All of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company s Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation ). In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 Subtopic 10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of a company require Class A common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Given that the Public Shares were issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., Public Warrants as defined in Note 3), the initial carrying value of the Public Shares classified as temporary equity was the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and other Options . The Public Shares are subject to ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either (i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. The Public Shares are redeemable and are classified as such on the balance sheet until such date that a redemption event takes place. Redemptions of the Company s Public Shares may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions, including minimum cash conditions, pursuant to an agreement relating to the Company s Business Combination. If the Company seeks stockholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a stockholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Placement Shares (as defined in Note 4), Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Certificate of Incorporation provides that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of or more of the Public Shares sold in the IPO, without the prior consent of the Company.

 of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock in conjunction with any such amendment. On April 12, 2023, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment (the Extension Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time, from April 19, 2023 to October 19, 2023 from the closing of the IPO). On August 30, 2023, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination up to four (4) times for an additional (1) month each time from October 19, 2023 to February 19, 2024 by depositing into the Company s trust account for each one-month extension the lesser of (a) and (b) for each then outstanding share after giving effect to any redemptions. On December 7, 2023, the Company, received a letter (the Letter from the staff at The Nasdaq Global Market Nasdaq notifying the Company that, for the 30 consecutive trading days prior to the date of the Letter, the Company s common stock had traded at a value below the minimum 50,000,000 Market Value of Listed Securities MVLS requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), which is required for continued listing of the Company s common stock on Nasdaq. The staff at Nasdaq subsequently determined that the Company has regained compliance, accordingly, the staff at Nasdaq have indicated that the matter is closed. On June 5, 2024, the Company was notified that the Company s securities were transferred to the Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on May 24, 2024. On February 16, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination up to eleven (11) times for an additional (1) month each time from February 19, 2024 to January 19, 2025 by depositing into the Company s trust account for each one-month extension the lesser of (a) and (b) for each then outstanding share after giving effect to any redemptions. If a Business Combination is not consummated by January 19, 2025, which is 36 months from the closing of the IPO, in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation for such an extension (the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay (a) its income and franchise taxes and (b) up to of dissolution expenses, if any, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, whose redemption will completely extinguish the Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. The Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and the Placement Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Stockholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only the per share initially held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account or to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors,

 -for-one basis (the Class B Conversion ). Notwithstanding the Class B Conversion, the Sponsor, as well as the officers and directors, will not be entitled to receive any funds held in the Trust Account with respect to any shares of Class A common stock issued to such holders as a result of the Class B Conversion, and no additional amounts will be deposited into the Trust Account in respect of shares of Class A common stock held by the Sponsor. On June 5, 2024, the Company received a notice (the Notice from the Staff stating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the Rule because it has not timely filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024 (the Form 10-Q with the SEC. The Rule requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. On July 3, 2024, the Company filed the Form 10-Q with the SEC and was notified by Nasdaq on July 30, 2024 that the matter is now closed. Liquidity, Going Concern, and Management s Plan Prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company lacked the liquidity it needed to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. The Company has since completed its IPO at which time capital in excess of the funds deposited in the Trust Account and/or used to fund offering expenses was released to the Company for general working capital purposes. Accordingly, management has since re-evaluated the Company s liquidity and financial condition and determined that the Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors or third parties. The Company s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs and there is no guarantee that the Company will receive such funds. As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not have sufficient working capital and will need to borrow additional funds from its Sponsor in order to fund its operations through one year from the date of this filing. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of and a working capital deficit. As of September 30, 2024, million has been drawn from the million promissory note provided from the Sponsor on April 17, 2023 and has been drawn from the million promissory note provided from the Sponsor on February 16, 2024. See Note 5 for references to Promissory Note and 2024 Promissory Note . In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution described in Note 1, should the Company be unable to complete a Business Combination, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has until January 19, 2025, from the closing of the IPO, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination during the specified period. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As is customary for a special purpose acquisition company, if the Company is not able to consummate a Business Combination by January 19, 2025, it will cease all operations and redeem the Public Shares. Management plans to continue its efforts to consummate a Business Combination prior to January 19, 2025.

On April 12, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders in connection with which the holders of Public Shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of . Following such redemptions, Public Shares remained outstanding. On August 30, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders in connection with which the holders of Public Shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of .

Following such redemptions, Public Shares remain outstanding. On February 16, 2024, the Sponsor determined to convert all the outstanding shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock on a -for-one basis (the Class B Conversion ). Notwithstanding the Class B Conversion, the Sponsor, as well as the officers and directors, will not be entitled to receive any funds held in the Trust Account with respect to any shares of Class A common stock issued to such holders as a result of the Class B Conversion, and no additional amounts will be deposited into the Trust Account in respect of shares of Class A common stock held by the Sponsor (see Note 7). The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable Class A common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit.

 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of the valuation allowance recorded. While ASC 740 identifies usage of the effective annual tax rate for purposes of an interim provision, it does allow for estimating individual elements in the current period if they are significant, unusual, or infrequent. Computing the effective tax rate for the Company is complicated due to the potential impact of the Company s change in fair value of a complex financial instrument, the timing of any potential business combination expenses and the actual interest income that will be recognized during the year. The Company has taken a position as to the calculation of income tax expense in the current period based on 740-270-25-3 which states, If an entity is unable to estimate a part of its ordinary income (or loss) or the related tax (or benefit) but is otherwise able to make a reliable estimate, the tax (or benefit) applicable to the item that cannot be estimated shall be reported in the interim period in which the item is reported. The Company believes its calculation to be a reliable estimate and allows it to properly take into account the unusual elements that can impact its annualized book income and its impact on the effective tax rate. As such, the Company is computing its taxable income (loss) and associated income tax provision based on actual results through September 30, 2024. ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were unrecognized tax benefits and amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals, or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income taxation by major taxing authorities since inception. These examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. The Company is incorporated in the State of Delaware and is required to pay franchise taxes to the State of Delaware and California on an annual basis.

Table of Contents) ) ) Denominator: Weighted-average shares outstanding Basic and diluted net (loss) income per share ). Although these Founder Shares were purchased by the independent directors for value, under ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC 718 ), these Founder Shares may be deemed stock-based compensation. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, under which stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period. To the extent a stock-based award is subject to a performance condition, the amount of expense recorded in a given period, if any, reflects an assessment of the probability of achieving such performance condition, with compensation recognized once the event is deemed probable to occur. The fair value of equity awards has been estimated using a market approach. Forfeitures are recognized as incurred. The fair value of the Founder Shares granted to an independent director by the Sponsor on January 12, 2023, was or per share. The fair value of the Founder Shares granted to certain independent directors by the Sponsor on December 8, 2022 was or per share, and the fair value of the Founder Shares granted to certain independent directors on December 21, 2021 was or per share. During 2022, shares of the Founder Shares granted on December 21, 2021 were terminated and returned to the Sponsor. The Company used a Monte Carlo Model simulation to arrive at the fair value of the stock compensation. The key assumptions in the model utilized are assumptions related to expected separation date of Units, anticipated business combination date, stock price at issuance, share-price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and present value. The expected volatility as of the IPO closing date was derived based upon similar SPAC equities and warrants and technology exchange funds within the Company s stated industry target and with terms until the exercise date. The Company s Founder Shares sold to independent directors (see Note 5) were deemed within the scope of ASC 718 and are subject to a performance condition, namely the occurrence of a Business Combination. Compensation expense related to the transferred Founder Shares is recognized only when the performance condition is probable of occurrence, or more specifically when a Business Combination is consummated. Therefore, stock-based compensation expense has been recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Overview We are a blank check company incorporated on October 8, 2021, as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses or entities that have not yet been selected. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector, or geographical location, we intend to focus on industries that complement our management s background and to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify and acquire a business. We may pursue a transaction in which our stockholders immediately prior to completion of our initial Business Combination, would collectively own a minority interest in the post-Business Combination company. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units held in the Trust Account (defined below), our shares, debt or a combination of cash, equity and debt. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities through September 30, 2024, were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the IPO (defined below), and, after our IPO, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenue until after the completion of our Business Combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on investments held in a trust account (the Trust Account ). We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 332,277, operating expenses of 405,352 driven by general and administrative expenses of 375,112, state franchise taxes of 30,240, interest on investments held in Trust Account of 89,718, and income tax expense of 16,643.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 933,491, operating expenses of 1,217,702 driven by general and administrative expenses of 1,168,811, state franchise taxes of 48,891, interest on investments held in Trust Account of 375,649, and income tax expense of 91,438. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 158,084, operating expenses of 557,155 driven by general and administrative expenses of 507,155, accrual of state franchise taxes of 50,000, interest on investments held in Trust Account of 1,017,239, and income tax expense of 302,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 2,148,709, operating expenses of 1,625,645 driven by general and administrative expense of 1,475,645 in addition to the accrual of state franchise taxes of 150,000, interest on investments held in Trust Account of 5,300,477, realized gain on investments held in the Trust Account of 479,857 and income tax expense of 2,005,980. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 1,188,114, mainly on account of the payment of operating expenses incurred to operate the business. Cash provided by investing activities was 17,436,642 and net cash used in financing activities was 16,248,948. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 4,025,827, mainly on account of the payment of operating expenses incurred to operate the business. Cash provided by investing activities was 278,587,105 and net cash used in financing activities was 274,878,429. We intend to use substantially all of the remaining funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less taxes payable and deferred underwriting commissions), to complete our initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest income to pay taxes, if any. Our annual tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account. To the extent that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. At September 30, 2024, we had cash of 1,593 held outside of the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account and additional funding from the Sponsor to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, properties or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. We will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from our Sponsor, or an affiliate of our Sponsor, stockholders, officers or directors, or third parties. Our officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet our working capital needs. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of this quarterly report.

 On April 17, 2023, the Company issued a promissory note (the Promissory Note to the Sponsor. Pursuant to the Promissory Note, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to an aggregate principal amount of 2.8 million. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and all outstanding amounts under the Promissory Note will be due on the date on which the Company consummates a business combination (the Maturity Date ). If the Company does not consummate a business combination, it may use a portion of any funds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Promissory Note; however, no proceeds from the Trust Account may be used for such repayment. If such funds are insufficient to repay the Promissory Note, the unpaid amounts would be forgiven. At the Maturity Date, the Sponsor may receive, at its option and in lieu of repayment in cash of all or any portion of the amount outstanding under the Promissory Note, the same consideration to be received by holders of the Company s Class A common stock at the closing of the Company s initial business combination, on the basis of two (2) shares of Class A common stock for each 10.00 loaned thereunder. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has borrowed 2.8 million under the Promissory Note.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.

 Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. The underwriter is entitled to deferred underwriting commissions of 15,125,000 in the aggregate, as described above. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. JOBS Act On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As such, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of executive compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Warrant Liabilities We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to our own Class A common stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The Company concluded that the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants issued pursuant to the warrant agreement qualify for equity accounting treatment.

 Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480. Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders equity section of our condensed balance sheets. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit. Net (Loss) Income Per Share of Common Stock We historically applied the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Net (loss) income per share of the redeemable shares, basic and diluted, is calculated by dividing the interest income earned on the Trust Account by the weighted average number of shares of redeemable common shares outstanding since original issuance. Net (loss) income per share of common shares, basic and diluted, for non-redeemable common shares is calculated by dividing the net (loss) income, less income attributable to shares of redeemable common shares, by the weighted average number of shares of non-redeemable common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01, Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profit Interest and Similar Awards ASU 2024-01 ). This ASU provides clarification on when profit interest awards should be accounted for similar to a cash bonus or profit-sharing arrangement in accordance with ASC 710 or as a share-based payment arrangement in accordance with ASC 718. The FASB issued this ASU to address diversity in the practice of accounting for profit interest awards. Management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2024-01 will have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements and disclosures. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our unaudited condensed financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not required for smaller reporting companies. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Other than the remediation efforts described below, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter of 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Remediation of a Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We recognize the importance of the control environment as it sets the overall tone for the Company and is the foundation for all other components of internal control. Consequently, we designed and implemented remediation measures to address the material weakness related to the Company s financial reporting of deferred tax assets, described in Note 10 of the notes to the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal period ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on June 26, 2024, and enhance our internal control over financial reporting. In light of the material weakness, we enhanced our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the calculation of deferred tax assets that apply to our financial statements, including providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents and increased communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding financial reporting of deferred tax assets. The foregoing actions were completed as of September 30, 2024, and we believe we have remediated the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described above. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will have the intended effects or be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses.

 PART II-OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings To the knowledge of our management team, there is no litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report include the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on June 26, 2024. You should review those risk factors for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. If any of those risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities On January 19, 2022, we consummated our IPO of 28,750,000 units, including 3,750,000 units issued pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriter s over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value 0.0001 per share Class A common stock ), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The units were sold at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 287,500,000. Cantor Fitzgerald acted as the sole bookrunner for the IPO. The units sold in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-261317), which was declared effective by the SEC on January 13, 2022. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 1,365,500 Private Placement Units (1,115,500 Private Placement Units to our Sponsor, 212,500 Private Placement Units to Cantor and 37,500 Private Placement Units to CCM) at a purchase price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 13,655,000, pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Offering costs for the initial public offering amounted to 20,697,498, consisting of 5,000,000 of upfront underwriting fees, 15,125,000 of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in the Trust Account), and 572,498 of other offering costs. The 15,125,000 of deferred underwriting fees payable is contingent upon the consummation of a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. A total of 293,250,000, comprised of the proceeds from the IPO after offering expenses and a portion of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Units, was initially placed in the Trust Account. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may be invested by the trustee only in (i) interest - bearing bank demand deposit accounts, (ii) uninvested, (iii) U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or (iv) money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. On April 12, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders in connection with which the holders of 18,885,901 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.3988 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 196,390,058. On August 30, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders in connection with which the holders of 7,560,892 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.6897 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 80,823,313. On February 16, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders in connection with which the holders of 1,592,678 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.9438 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 17,430,007. Following such redemptions, 710,529 Public Shares remain outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, 7,940,003 remains in the Trust Account. For a description of the use of the proceeds generated in our IPO, see Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q.
