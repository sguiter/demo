 types of derivatives that the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies. 
 When a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates all interest-rate and treasury-rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, cross-currency contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Certain currency contracts related to forecasted transactions are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective through the use of a qualitative assessment, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively. 
 Counterparties to Linde's derivatives are major banking institutions with credit ratings of investment grade or better. The company has Credit Support Annexes ("CSAs") in place for certain entities with their principal counterparties to minimize potential default risk and to mitigate counterparty risk. Under the CSAs, the fair values of derivatives for the purpose of interest rate and currency management are collateralized with cash on a regular basis. As of September 30, 2024, the impact of such collateral posting arrangements on the fair value of derivatives was insignificant. Management believes the risk of incurring losses on derivative contracts related to credit risk is remote and any losses would be immaterial.

 (a) Amounts as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included current assets of million and million which are recorded in prepaid and other current assets; long-term assets of million and million which are recorded in other long-term assets; current liabilities of million and million which are recorded in other current liabilities; and long-term liabilities of million and million which are recorded in other long-term liabilities. 
 In addition, during the third quarter of 2024, Linde issued credit default swaps CDS to a third-party financial institution. The CDS relate to a secured borrowing provided by the financial institution to a government customer in Mexico, that was utilized to pay certain of Linde s outstanding receivables. The notional amount of the CDS, which was million as of September 30, 2024, will reduce on a monthly basis over its term. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of this derivative liability was not material. 
 Balance Sheet Items 
 Foreign currency contracts related to balance sheet items consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on recorded balance sheet assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating unit. Certain forward currency contracts are entered into to protect underlying monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies from foreign exchange risk and are not designated as hedging instruments. For balance sheet items that are not designated as hedging instruments, the fair value adjustments on these contracts are offset by the fair value adjustments recorded on the underlying monetary assets and liabilities. 
 Forecasted Transactions 
 Foreign currency contracts related to forecasted transactions consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on (1) forecasted purchases of capital-related equipment and services, (2) forecasted sales, or (3) other forecasted cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating units. For forecasted transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) with deferred amounts reclassified to earnings over the same time period as the income statement impact of the associated purchase. For forecasted transactions that do not qualify for cash flow hedging relationships, fair value adjustments are recorded directly to earnings. Linde is hedging forecasted transactions for a maximum period of . 
 Commodity Contracts 
 Commodity contracts are entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, which arise in the normal course of business from its procurement transactions. To reduce the extent of this risk, Linde enters into a limited number of electricity, natural gas, and propane gas derivatives. For forecasted transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) with deferred amounts reclassified to

. 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 As of September 30, 2024, Linde has billion billion) Euro-denominated notes and intercompany loans, billion billion) CNY-denominated intercompany loans and C billion billion) CAD-denominated intercompany loans that are designated as hedges of the net investment positions in certain foreign operations. Since hedge inception, the deferred loss recorded within the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheet is million (deferred loss of million and million in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively). 
 As of September 30, 2024, exchange rate movements relating to previously designated hedges that remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is a gain of million. These movements will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until appropriate, such as upon sale or liquidation of the related foreign operations at which time amounts will be reclassified to the consolidated statements of income. 
 Interest Rate Swaps 
 Linde has historically used interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities as a result of interest rate changes. When used, these interest rate swaps would effectively convert fixed-rate interest exposures to variable rates; fair value adjustments were recognized in earnings along with an equally offsetting charge/benefit to earnings for the changes in the fair value of the underlying financial asset or financial liability (See Note 3). 
 In addition, as of December 31, 2023, Linde was using interest rate swaps with a notional value of billion to hedge the variability of future cash flows of forecasted transactions due to interest rate risk and had designated this as a cash flow hedge. The interest rate swaps were terminated during the first quarter of 2024 with the February debt issuance and the settlement values were . 
 Derivatives' Impact on Consolidated Statements of Income) ) ) Other balance sheet items ) ) ) Total ) ) ) 
 The gains (losses) on balance sheet items are offset by gains (losses) recorded on the underlying hedged assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the gains (losses) for the derivatives and the underlying hedged assets and liabilities related to debt items are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as interest expense-net. Other balance sheet items and anticipated net income gains (losses) are generally recorded in the consolidated statements of income as other income (expenses)-net. 
 The amounts of gain or loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the consolidated statement of income was not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net impacts expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are also not material.

 Investments and securities Total Liabilities Derivative liabilities 
 Investments and securities are recorded in prepaid and other current assets and other long-term assets in the company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Level 1 investments and securities are marketable securities traded on an exchange. Level 2 investments are based on market prices obtained from independent brokers or determined using quantitative models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions. Level 3 investments and securities consist of a venture fund. For the valuation, Linde uses the net asset value received as part of the fund's quarterly reporting, which for the most part is not based on quoted prices in active markets. In order to reflect current market conditions, Linde proportionally adjusts by observable market data (stock exchange prices) or current transaction prices. 
 Changes in level 3 investments and securities were immaterial. 
 The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, accounts receivable-net, and accounts payable approximate carrying value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
 The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. Long-term debt is categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of Linde s long-term debt portfolio was million versus a carrying value of million. At December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of Linde s long-term debt portfolio was million versus a carrying value of million. Differences between the carrying value and the fair value are attributable to fluctuations in interest rates subsequent to when the debt was issued and relative to stated coupon rates.

 per share. Any such increase would apply to all Linde AG shares that were outstanding on April 8, 2019, when the cash merger squeeze-out was completed. The period for plaintiffs to file claims expired on July 9, 2019. In November 2023, the court issued a decision rejecting the plaintiffs claims in their entirety and determining that the cash merger squeeze-out consideration was appropriate. The plaintiffs have appealed this decision. 
 The company believes the consideration paid was fair and that the claims are not supported by sufficient evidence, and no reserve has been established. We cannot estimate the timing of resolution. 
 On May 27, 2022, performance of Linde Engineering agreements in Russia were lawfully suspended in compliance with applicable sanctions. In December 2022, a Russian court based in St. Petersburg ("St. Petersburg Court") issued an injunction preventing (i) the sale of any shares in Linde s subsidiaries and joint ventures in Russia, and (ii) the disposal of any of the assets in those entities exceeding of the relevant company s overall asset value. The injunction was requested by RusChemAlliance (RCA) to secure payment of a possible award under an arbitration proceeding RCA intended to file against Linde Engineering for alleged breach of contract under the agreement to build a gas processing plant in Russia entered into in July 2021. In March 2023, RCA filed a claim in St. Petersburg against Linde GmbH for recovery of advance payments under the agreement ("GPP Claim"), and subsequently (i) added Linde and other Linde subsidiaries as defendants, and (ii) is seeking payment of alleged damages from Linde and guarantor banks. In March 2024, RCA filed a similar claim for repayment and damages against Linde for alleged breach of contract under the agreement to build a liquefied natural gas plant in Russia entered into in September 2021 LNG Claim , and together with the GPP Claim, the Russian Claims ). 
 In accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of the agreements, in 2023, Linde filed a notice of arbitration with the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre ("HKIAC") against RCA to claim that (i) RCA has no entitlement to payment, (ii) RCA s Russian Claims are in breach of the arbitration agreement which requires HKIAC arbitration, and (iii) RCA must compensate Linde for the losses and damages caused by the injunction. During 2024, Linde secured awards on exclusive jurisdiction with HKIAC. 
 In January 2024, the Hong Kong court issued a final judgment in Linde s favor (i) granting a permanent anti-suit injunction against RCA to seek a stay of the GPP claim and not start an LNG claim, (ii) granting a permanent, global anti-enforcement injunction against RCA for the GPP claim, and (iii) ordering that the injunction issued by the St. Petersburg Court be lifted HK Court Judgement ).

 billion recorded in Other long-term liabilities, which represents advance payments previously recorded in contract liabilities related to terminated engineering projects with RCA. As a result of the contract terminations, Linde no longer has future performance obligations for these projects. 
 It is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of these matters. The company intends to vigorously defend its interests in the Russian Claims, Hong Kong arbitration proceedings and other jurisdictions.

 basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer s volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, carbon dioxide, helium, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the distribution methods. 
 Following is a description of each of the industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies : 
 On-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. Where there are large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from - years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements. 
 The company s performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical expedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained. 
 Merchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments. 
 The company s performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. 
 Packaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments. 
 The company s performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms. 
 Engineering 
 The company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Changes to cost estimates and contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as cumulative adjustments for the inception-to-date effect of such change. 
 Contract Assets and Liabilities 
 Contract assets and liabilities result from differences in timing of revenue recognition and customer invoicing. Contract assets primarily relate to sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. The balance represents unbilled revenue which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds amounts invoiced to customers. Customer invoices may be based on the passage of time, the achievement of certain contractual milestones or a combination of both criteria. Contract liabilities include advance payments or right to consideration prior to performance under the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied under contract terms. Linde has contract assets of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total contract liabilities are million at September 30, 2024 (current contract liabilities of million and million within other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets). As of September 30, 2024, Linde has approximately million recorded in contract liabilities related to engineering projects in Russia subject to sanctions. Total contract liabilities were million at December 31, 2023 (current contract liabilities of million and million within other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets). Revenue recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was included in the contract liability at December 31, 2023 was million. Contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the Engineering business and customer prepayments for certain on-site supply agreements. 
 Payment Terms and Other 
 Linde generally receives payment after performance obligations are satisfied, and customer prepayments are not typical for the industrial gases business. Payment terms vary based on the country where sales originate and local customary payment practices. Linde does not offer extended financing outside of customary payment terms. Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions are presented on a net basis and are not included in sales within the consolidated statement of income. Additionally, sales returns and allowances are not a normal practice in the industry and are not significant.

 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 As described above, Linde's contracts with on-site customers are under long-term supply arrangements which generally require the customer to purchase their requirements from Linde and also have minimum purchase requirements. Additionally, plant sales from the Linde Engineering business are primarily contracted on a fixed price basis. The company estimates the consideration related to future minimum purchase requirements and plant sales was approximately billion. This amount excludes all on-site sales above minimum purchase requirements, which can be significant depending on customer needs. In the

Higher pricing contributed 2 to sales in both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Engineering increased sales by 2 in the quarter and 1 in the year-to-date period. Currency translation decreased sales by 1 in the quarter primarily driven by weakening of the Brazilian real and Mexican peso, partially offset by a strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar. Currency translation decreased sales by 1 in the year-to-date period driven primarily by the weakening of the Brazilian real, Chinese yuan, and Korean won. Cost pass-through decreased sales by 1 in both the quarter and year-to-date periods, with minimal impact on operating profit. Volumes were flat in both the quarter and year-to-date periods versus the respective 2023 periods, as base volume declines were largely offset by new project start-ups. 
 Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
 Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased 42 million, or 1 , for the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher Engineering sales and decreased 238 million, or 2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower cost pass-through and productivity gains which more than offset cost inflation. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 52.1 and 51.9 of sales, respectively, for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 52.9 and 53.2 for the respective 2023 periods. The decrease as a percentage of sales in the quarter was primarily due to higher pricing and lower cost pass-through. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expense ("SG A") increased 15 million, or 2 , for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 60 million or 2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 driven by higher costs. SG A was 9.8 and 10.2 of third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 sales, respectively versus 9.9 and 10.0 of the respective 2023 periods. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Reported depreciation and amortization expense increased 1 million for the third quarter of 2024 and remained flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 On an adjusted basis, depreciation and amortization increased 10 million, for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 33 million for the year-to-date period driven by new project start ups. 
 Cost reduction program and other charges 
 Cost reduction program and other charges were 145 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2 million and 42 million for the respective 2023 periods. 2024 includes severance charges of 148 million and 165 million for

 the quarter and year to date periods, other cost reduction charges of 40 million and 23 million for the quarter and year to date periods, and other benefit of 43 million for the quarter and year to date periods related to a divestiture in APAC. 
 Other income (expense) - net 
 Reported other income (expense) - net was a benefit of 51 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 111 million for the year-to-date period, including a benefit of 36 million related to a settlement with a supplier in the Americas, recognized during the third quarter, and 43 million in insurance recoveries, primarily within the Other segment, recognized during the first quarter. 
 Operating profit 
 On a reported basis, operating profit increased 34 million, or 2 , for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 369 million, or 6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the quarter and year-to-date periods of 2024 was primarily due to higher pricing, savings from productivity initiatives and, which more than offset the adverse impacts of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency. 
 On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction programs and other charges, operating profit increased 171 million, or 7 in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 442 million, or 7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during the quarter and year-to-date periods of 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows. 
 Interest expense - net 
 Reported interest expense - net increased 28 million for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 74 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in both periods was driven primarily by higher interest rates on debt. 
 Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost 
 Reported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of 45 million and 144 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus 35 million and 125 million for the respective 2023 periods. The increase in the benefit primarily relates to higher expected return on assets and lower amortization of deferred losses year-over-year. 
 Effective tax rate 
 The reported effective tax rate ("ETR") for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 24.1 and 23.3 versus 23.8 and 22.6 for the respective 2023 periods. The increase in the quarter rate is primarily related to tax effects of cost reduction program and other charges. The increase in the year to date rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company s uncertain tax positions and a tax refund, partially offset by tax benefits from a repatriation in the current year. Effective January 1, 2024, Linde is subject to the 15 global minimum tax rate provisions of the OECD s framework for Pillar Two, the implementation of which did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate for the quarter or year-to-date periods. 
 
 On an adjusted basis, the ETR for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.6 and 23.3 versus 23.7 and 23.8 for the respective 2023 periods. The decrease in the year-to-date rate is primarily due to tax benefits from a repatriation. 
 
 Income from equity investments 
 Reported income from equity investments for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 38 million and 131 million versus 41 million and 128 million for the respective 2023 periods. 
 On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 56 million and 185 million versus 59 million and 182 million for the respective 2023 periods. 
 Noncontrolling interests 
 At September 30, 2024, noncontrolling interests consisted primarily of non-controlling shareholders' investments in APAC (primarily China). Reported noncontrolling interests income was 53 million and 128 million for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment. Noncontrolling interest was 36 million and 109 million for the the respective 2023 periods.

Reported diluted earnings increased 0.59, or 6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the respective 2023 periods. The increase is due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding. 
 On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 0.31 and 0.93 for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, or 9 respectively. The increase is primarily due to higher adjusted net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding. 
 Employees 
 The number of employees at September 30, 2024 was 65,596, a decrease of 846 employees from September 30, 2023 including the impact of ongoing cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC. 
 Other Financial Data 
 EBITDA was 3,084 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 3,052 million in the respective 2023 period. EBITDA was 9,363 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 8,991 million in the respective 2023 period. The increase was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased to 3,253 million for the third quarter 2024 from 3,074 million in the respective 2023 period. Adjusted EBITDA was 9,575 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 9,096 million in the respective 2023 period. The higher EBITDA was primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit versus the respective prior periods. 
 See the "Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations" section for definitions and reconciliations of these adjusted non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts. 
 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
 Other comprehensive income for the third quarter of 2024 was 764 million and loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 250 million. The income in the quarter and loss for the year-to-date period resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of 773 million and 245 million, respectively. The translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements to U.S. dollars, and are largely driven by the movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the Euro, British pound and the Chinese yuan. See the "Currency" section of the MD A for exchange rates used for translation purposes and Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a summary of the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by segment.

 Currency 
 The results of Linde's non-U.S. operations are translated to the company s reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, from the functional currencies. For most operations, Linde uses the local currency as its functional currency. There is inherent variability and unpredictability in the relationship of these functional currencies to the U.S. dollar and such currency movements may materially impact Linde's results of operations in any given periods. 
 To help understand the reported results, the following is a summary of the significant currencies underlying Linde's consolidated results and the exchange rates used to translate the financial statements (rates of exchange expressed in units of local currency per U.S. dollar):

 Cash Flow from Operations 
 Cash provided by operations of 6,614 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 36 million, or 1 versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher net income adjusted for non-cash charges, partially offset by higher net working capital requirements including lower inflows from contract liabilities from engineering customer advance payments and higher cash taxes. 
 Linde estimates that total 2024 required contributions to its pension plans will be in the range of approximately 30 million to 40 million , of which 29 million has been made through September 30, 2024. 
 Investing 
 Net cash used for investing activities of 3,268 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 176 million versus 2023, due to lower acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and higher divestiture proceeds, net of cash provided, largely offset by higher capital expenditures. 
 Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 3,247 million, 611 million higher than the prior year due primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for backlog growth requirements.

(b) Net of income taxes which are shown separately in Adjusted Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate . (c) The company believes that its non-GAAP measures excluding Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG are useful to investors because: (i) the 2018 business combination was a merger of equals in an all-stock merger transaction, with no cash consideration, (ii) the company is managed on a geographic basis and the results of certain geographies are more heavily impacted by purchase accounting than others, causing results that are not comparable at the reportable segment level, therefore, the impacts of purchase accounting adjustments to each segment vary and are not comparable within the company and when compared to other companies in similar regions, (iii) business management is evaluated and variable compensation is determined based on results excluding purchase accounting impacts, and; (iv) it is important to investors and analysts to understand the purchase accounting impacts to the financial statements. 
 A summary of each of the adjustments made for Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG are as follows: 
 Adjusted Operating Profit and Margin: The purchase accounting adjustments for the periods presented relate primarily to depreciation and amortization related to the fair value step up of fixed assets and intangible assets (primarily customer related) acquired in the merger and the allocation of fair value step-up for ongoing Linde AG asset disposals (reflected in Other Income/(Expense)). 
 Adjusted Interest Expense - Net : Relates to the amortization of the fair value of debt acquired in the merger. 
 Adjusted Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate: Relates to the current and deferred income tax impact on the adjustments discussed above. The income tax expense (benefit) on the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments was determined using the applicable tax rates for the jurisdictions that were utilized in calculating the GAAP income tax expense (benefit) and included both current and deferred income tax amounts.
