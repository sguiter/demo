Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying interim condensed
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). 

Going Concern 

The accompanying interim unaudited
interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business are dependent on, among other things, the Company s ability to operate profitably, to generate
cash flows from operations, and to pursue financing arrangements to support its working capital requirements. 

In assessing the Company s
liquidity, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash and cash equivalents and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. [The
Company s liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations.
As of June 30, 2024, the Company s current liabilities exceeded the current assets by 15,630,549, its accumulated deficit was 17,077,977
and the Company has incurred losses during the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. None of the Company s stockholders, officers
or directors, or third parties, are under any obligation to advance us funds, or to invest in us. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain
additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity,
which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of our business plan, and reducing
overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at
all. 

22 

In evaluating if there is
substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern, the Company are trying to alleviate the going concern risk through
(1) increasing cash generated from operations by controlling operating expenses and gradually shifted the business focus to the brand
authorization for community healthy station and operation service charges to bring in more revenue, (2) financing from domestic banks
and other financial institutions, and (3) equity or debt financing. The Company has certain plans to mitigate these adverse conditions
and to increase the liquidity. 

On an on-going basis, the
Company will also receive financial support commitments from the Company s related parties. 

These conditions raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management of the Company to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, the
Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Revenue Recognition 

Zhuoxun Beijing recognizes
revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which Zhuoxun Beijing
expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Zhuoxun Beijing recognizes revenues following the five-step model prescribed
under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine
the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues
when (or as) it satisfies the performance obligation. 

Revenues are recognized when
control of the promised goods or services is transferred to its customers, which may occur at a point in time or over time depending on
the terms and conditions of the agreement, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those
goods or services. 

Zhuoxun Beijing identified the following performance
obligations for each type of contract: 

Training revenue 

Zhuoxun Beijing s online
training course service primarily includes coursewares or videos which are already published on the website. Other than providing the
access, there are no bundle or multiple separable and distinct tasks. According to ASC 606-10-25-19, there is one performance obligation
for the training course service. The Company required and received fees before participants accessed the online courses. Revenue recognised
over the period of the card after the E-card was activated. 

Charge for use of brand 

Zhuoxun Beijing
authorized other enterprises or individuals to use the Zhuoxun Beijing s brand, providing services to customers at their location,
with a brand usage fee. Revenue was recognized when such events using the Company s brand are completed. 

23 

Online sales 

Zhuoxun Beijing sells goods
through live streaming to customers, and arranging for their suppliers to provide goods directly to customers. Revenue is recognized on
a net basis, revenue is generated from sales less the cost of goods purchased. 

The amount of other revenues
was immaterial compared to total revenue during the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Practical expedients and exemption 

Zhuoxun Beijing has not incurred
any costs to obtain contracts, and does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected
length of one year or less. 

Other service income is earned
when services have been rendered. 

Income Taxes 

We account for income taxes
using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the
differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of
available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect
on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

We apply ASC 740, Accounting
for Income Taxes, to account for uncertainty in income taxes and the evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step
is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of
any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets
the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is
measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions
that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which
the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized
in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met. 

Foreign Currency and Foreign Currency Translation 

The functional currency of
the Company is the United States dollar US dollar ). Fengyuan Beijing, Zhuoxun Beijing and Zhuoxun Beijing s subsidiaries,
all of which are based in PRC, use the local currency, the Chinese Yuan RMB ), as their functional currencies. An entity s
functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates, normally that is the currency of the environment
in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. Management s judgment is essential to determine the functional currency
by assessing various indicators, such as cash flows, sales price and market, expenses, financing and inter-company transactions and arrangements. 

Foreign currency transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are re-measured
at the applicable rates of exchange in effect at that date. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency re-measurement are included
in the statements of comprehensive loss. 

The consolidated financial
statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate in effect
at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average of the exchange rates in effect during the reporting
period. Stockholders equity accounts are translated using the historical exchange rates at the date the entry to stockholders 
equity was recorded, except for the change in retained earnings during the period, which is translated using the historical exchange
rates used to translate each period s income statement. Differences resulting from translating functional currencies to the reporting
currency are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. 

24 

Translation of amounts from
RMB into U.S. dollars has been made at the following exchange rates:

Impairment of Long-lived Assets 

In accordance with ASC 360-10-35,
the Company reviews the carrying values of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, the Company measures
any impairment of long-lived assets using the projected discounted cash flow method at the asset group level. The estimation of future
cash flows requires significant management judgment based on the Company s historical results and anticipated results and is subject
to many factors. The discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the Company s business model is determined by
its management. An impairment loss would be recorded if the Company determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be
recoverable. The impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed the fair value
of the assets. As of June 30, 2024, the impairment loss was 49,271. No impairment has been recorded by the Company as of September 30,
2023. 

Credit risk 

Financial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to a significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. As of June
30, 2024 and 2023, substantially all of the Company s cash and cash equivalents were held by major financial institutions located
in the PRC, which management believes are of high credit quality. 

For the credit risk related
to trade accounts receivable, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and, if necessary, maintains reserves for
potential credit losses. Historically, such losses have been within management s expectations. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

U.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier
hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring the fair value of financial instruments. This hierarchy
also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
The three-tier fair value hierarchy is: 

Level 1 observable inputs that
reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2 include other inputs
that are directly or indirectly observable in the market place 

Level 3 unobservable inputs
which are supported by little or no market activity 

The carrying value of the
Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other receivables, other current assets, accounts
and other payables, and other short-term liabilities approximate their fair value due to their short maturities.

Revenue 

The Company s revenue
decreased from 22,340 to 13,917 during the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. Due to the impact

months ended June 30, 2024 decreased by approximtely 8,500 compared with the nine months ended June 30, 2023. 

Cost of revenue 

Our cost of revenue was 864

As of June 30, 2024, we had

and unrelated parties. 

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating
activities was 703,281 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 1,468,073 net cash used in operating activities for the
nine months ended June 30, 2023. 

The

increase in other receivables of 16,711, partially offset by adjustments to reconcile net loss of 70,246, and the increase in
accrued liabilities of 900,251. 

The
net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 was mainly due to our net loss of 2,048,604, partially
offset by adjustments to reconcile net loss of 151,138, the decrease in advance from clients of 210,798, and the increase in
accrued liabilities of 775,142. 

Financing Activities

activities was 678,219 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 642,027 for the nine months ended June 30, 2023. The
net cash used in investing activities was mainly attributable to amount due to related parties. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of June 30, 2024 and September
30, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that is material to investors. 

28 

Limited Operating History; Need for Additional
Capital 

There is limited historical
financial information about the Company on which to base an evaluation of its performance. There is no guarantee on the continued success
in its business operations. The business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited
capital resources, a narrow client base, limited sources of revenue, and possible cost overruns due to the price and cost increases in
supplies and services. 

Without additional funding,
management believes that the Company will not have sufficient funds to meet its obligations beyond one year after the date our condensed
consolidated financial statements are issued. These conditions give rise to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going
concern. 

The Company has been, and
intend to continue, working toward identifying and obtaining new sources of financing. To date it has been dependent on related parties
for its source of funding. No assurances can be given that it will be successful in obtaining additional financing in the future. Any
future financing that it may obtain may cause significant dilution to existing stockholders. Any debt financing or other financing of
securities senior to common stock that it is able to obtain will likely include financial and other covenants that will restrict its flexibility.
Any failure to comply with these covenants would have a negative impact on its business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows. 

If adequate funds are not
available, it may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate portions of it or Zhuoxun Beijing s operations or obtain funds through
arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our assets. Accordingly, the inability
to obtain such financing could result in a significant loss of ownership and/or control of our assets and could also adversely affect
the Company s ability to fund it or Zhuoxun Beijing s continued operations and expansion efforts. 

During the next 12 months,
the Company expect to incur the same amount of expenses each month. However, as Zhuoxun Beijing works to expand its operations, it expects
to incur significant research, marketing and development costs and expenses on Zhuoxun Beijing s online service platforms that meet
the constantly evolving industry standards and consumer demands. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

There have been no material
changes to the Company s market risk during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. For a discussion of the Company s exposure

Disclosures About Market Risk of the its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on
May 31, 2024 (the 10-K ). 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and
with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date ). Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s
former management abandoned all operations for several years, and only recently did the Company appoint new management to make filings
with the SEC on behalf of the Company. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We or the VIE are not currently
involved in any material legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigations incidental to the business, to which we, any of our
subsidiaries, or the VIE and its subsidiary (Beijing Zhuoxun Education Technology Co., Ltd.) is a party or of which any of our property
is the subject. From time-to-time we or the VIE are, and we or the VIE anticipate that we or the VIE will be, involved in legal proceedings,
claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of our or the VIE s business and otherwise. The ultimate costs to resolve
any such matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. We could be forced to incur material expenses with
respect to these legal proceedings, and in the event that there is an outcome in any that is adverse to us, our financial position and
prospects could be harmed. 

Item 1a. Risk Factors 

For a discussion of our risk
factors, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 10-K. The risks and uncertainties that we face are not limited to those
set forth in the 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may
also adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities. There have been no material changes to the Company s
risk factors since the filing of the 10-K.

and Use of Proceeds
