Thumzup 
Products and Services 

The
Company operates in a single business segment which is social media marketing and advertising. The Thumzup App works on both iPhone
and Android mobile operating systems and connects brands and people who use and love these brands. For the Advertiser, Thumzup incentivizes
ordinary people to become paid content Creators and post authentic valuable posts on social media about the Advertiser and its products. 

The
Company seeks to capitalize on nationwide-wide gig economy and business democratization trends. Immense value and opportunity have been
created through the democratization of ride sharing, hospitality, finance and other industries. The Thumzup tools are designed to
facilitate this democratization trend for the consumer and the Advertiser within the online marketing and advertising space. 

The
Company has built the technology to support an influencer and gig economy community around its Thumzup App. This technology
and community are designed to generate scalable authentic product posts and recommendations for advertisers on social media. It is designed
to connect advertisers with individuals who are willing to tell their friends about the advertisers products online and offline. 

Since
May of 2024, Thumzup has expanded its AdTech platform to include Hollywood and Beverly Grove, significantly broadening its influence
across Greater Los Angeles. This expansion is designed to revolutionize how local businesses engage with potential and current customers
through enhanced social media interaction. 

Social
Media Marketing Software Technology 

The
Thumzup mobile App enables Creators, to select from brands advertising on the App and get paid to post about the advertiser on social
media. Once the Thumzup Creator selects the brand and takes a photo using the Thumzup App, the Thumzup App posts the photo
and a caption to the Creator s social media accounts. The advertiser then reviews and approves the post for payment and the Creator
can cash out whenever they choose through popular digital payment systems. For the advertiser, the Thumzup system enables brands
to get real people to promote their products to their friends. In 2023, 148 billion was spent on digital display ads in the United States
and while 43 of marketers consider display ads to be the least effective channel, 84 of marketers were still investing in them(1).
We feel this demonstrates a significant need among advertisers for new methods of messaging to potential customers. We believe Thumzup s
ability to scale brand messages from the general population on social media could be part of addressing this substantial need in the
market. 

A
recent Nielsen report found 81 of consumers believe friends and family are the most reliable sources of information about products(2).
According to a Emplifi article, 64 of millennials recommend a product at least once a month(3), and according to a 2019 Morning Consult
survey, 86 of Gen Z and millennials would post content for monetary compensation(4). Further, according to a 2020 IZEA Insights Study,
67 of social media consumers aspire to be paid social media influencers(5). According to a 2023 Bankrate, 48 of social media users
have impulsively purchased a product seen on social media(6). Lastly, 85 of Gen Z says social media impacts purchase decisions according
to a 2023 Retail Dive Survey(7). 

The
average American adult spent 7 hours and 58 minutes per day using digital media in 2020 according to a 2020 eMarketer Report(8). The
amount of daily usage has increased significantly since 2019, again according to an eMarketer Report(8), and the Company believes such
usage will continue to accelerate. The Company empowers businesses that want to interact with these Creators and provides tools and data
so they can increase consumer awareness and expand their customer bases. 

In
the past decade, social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and TikTok have achieved mass worldwide consumer
acceptance and created hundreds of billions of dollars in shareholder value. This worldwide viral growth demonstrates that compelling
new social media platforms which present the right combination of experience and value, will attract Creators who will invest significant
amounts of time on the platforms. 

18 

The
Company is an early-stage entity building a new real-time platform which enables Advertisers to pay their customers and fans cash for
their positive social media posts about their products and services, which in turn supports those individuals who earn money from various
gig economy opportunities. The Company believes that acceptance of its App and subsequent revenue growth can be driven by empowering
everyday people to make money by posting about brands and services that they already find enjoyable and attractive on social media. The
Company believes that the Thumzup App is a conduit for Advertisers to connect directly with consumers. The Company will need to
secure enough advertisers to make the App an attractive platform for adoption and scalability, and to ensure that the platform is interesting
enough for the Creators to return to on a regular basis. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to achieve these results.

Intellectual
Property 

The
Company owns the copyrights to the source code for the Thumzup App on the iPhone iOS and Android operating mobile operating systems
as used on the majority of mobile phone and tablet devices. The Company also owns the source code for the backend system
that administrates the Thumzup App, tracks payments and advertising campaigns. 

The
Thumzup thumb logo is a registered trademark owned by Thumzup Media
Corporation, Reg. No. 6,842,424, registered Sep. 13, 2022. On April 13, 2021, the Company filed a trademark application ser. No.
90642789 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office USPTO for the word mark THUMZUP, which was granted registration
on June 21, 2022, resulting in reg. no. 6764158. Also on April 13, 2021, the Company filed a trademark application ser. No. 90642848
for the Thumzup logo, featuring a stylized hand with an upwardly extended thumb. Meta Platforms, Inc. (which owns and operates
Facebook and Instagram) initially filed opposition to the logo on June 30, 2022. Thumzup agreed to not use the logo as a
reaction to a post and Meta Platforms, Inc. subsequently withdrew their opposition on August 5, 2022 and it was dismissed without
prejudice. 

Business
Model 

Advertisers
purchase an ad campaign on the Thumzup advertiser dashboard website. Once the Advertiser approves a post for payment, the platform
facilitates the payment to Creators a monetary amount per screened post which may range from 1.00 to 1,000.00. The Thumzup 
platform enables the Advertiser to screen posts so that the Advertiser only pays for posts that are commercially valuable and rewards
Creators for posts that have images and text that represent the Advertiser in a positive manner. 

19 

Per
Post Fee . Thumzup Advertisers are charged a Per Post Fee. By way of illustration, an Advertiser that buys 100,000
posts from Thumzup , to pay out 10 per post to Thumzup Creators, would purchase the posts for 13.00 each or 1,300,000. The
Creators in this illustration would receive a total of 1,000,000 and Thumzup would retain 300,000 for its services. The Thumzup 
platform would facilitate 100,000 posts for the Advertiser from Thumzup Creators sharing with their friends about their endorsed
products on social media. 

Value
Proposition 

The
Thumzup App is designed to generate scalable social media authentic social media content for Advertisers. It is designed to connect
Advertisers with individuals who are willing to authentically promote their products online. The Company envisions that many gig economy
workers will be ideal candidates to become Creators posting on Thumzup . Imagine a gig economy driver waiting for their next fare
who takes a moment to post about the good experience they had at their lunch spot where they are waiting. Imagine a gig economy worker
on a laptop at a coffee shop doing a graphic design project from a gig economy site who takes a moment to post about the coffee shop
where they are working on Thumzup . The Company believes that Thumzup can readily provide extra income for this existing pool
of gig economy workers. The Company believes these gig economy workers will be able to provide quality Thumzup posts on social media
for which Advertisers will be willing to pay. 

The
Thumzup App can also facilitate digital word of mouth recommendations of products and services from people who do not need to make
extra money doing gigs, who are in fact quite affluent. The Company believes that many people who are well off may also use the App to
recommend products and services to their network of friends on social media, many of whom may also be affluent. 

Key Metrics as of November 8, 2024 

Thumzup has paid out on 25,996 approved posts to 1,472 Thumzup users regarding
559 advertisers since inception. 

Thumzup advertisers have grown by a 209 CAGR since November 8, 2023. 

Regulatory
Compliance 

The
Federal Trade Commission regulates and requires certain disclosures by social media influencers, specifying when disclosure is required,
and how the disclosure should be presented. These rules are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations, 16 CFR Part 255. Specifically,
the FTC requires that influencers disclose any financial, employment, personal, or family relationship with a brand. Influencers must
disclose financial relationships and consideration paid including any money, discounted products or other benefits paid to the influencer.
Creators on the Thumzup platform are being paid to post about Thumzup advertisers. Thumzup puts #ad in each post made
on its platform to disclose that the creator has been paid to make the post. 

GOING
CONCERN 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company was only recently formed, has not
yet established profitable operations and has incurred losses since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern. In this regard, management is proposing to raise additional funds not provided by operations
through loans or through sales of its common stock. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising this additional
capital or in achieving profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

20 

The
Company is a beginning revenue, software and services company that has primarily relied on equity funding for its operations. At September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash balances of 110,246 and 259,212, respectively. For the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, the Company used 1,053,175 and 1,911,767 in operating activities, respectively.
The Company has an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of 7,038,071 and 5,691,803 respectively, and the
Company may need to raise additional funding in order to continue as a going concern.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The
Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures . 

a)
Disclosure and control procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q, and have concluded that, based on such evaluation,
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2024 as described below. 

Notwithstanding
the conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report, we
believe that our financial statements and other information contained in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material
respects, our business, financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. 

b)
Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a
-15(f) under the Exchange Act . Our internal control was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of
directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 

Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to assets of the Company (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. 

In
making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (issued in 2013). 

Based
upon the assessments, management has concluded that as of September 30, 2024, there was a material weakness in our internal control over
financial reporting due to the fact that we did not have an adequate process established to ensure appropriate levels of review of accounting
and financial reporting matters, which resulted in our closing process not identifying all required adjustments and disclosures in a
timely fashion. 

We
plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. To remediate our material weaknesses,
we plan to appoint additional qualified personnel with the requisite knowledge to improve the levels of review of accounting and financial
reporting matters; however, such remediation efforts are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing or generating significant
revenue to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. 

The
effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including
the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate
misconduct completely. Accordingly, in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any
system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable,
not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits
of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate
for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial
reporting.
