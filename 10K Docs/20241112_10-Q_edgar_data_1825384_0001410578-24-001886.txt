 Total revenue from contracts with customers ASC Topic 606 does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments and interest and dividend income. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts. Discounts to par value on securities purchased are accreted into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective interest method. Premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized to the first call date into interest income using the effective interest method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period. Discounts and premiums to par generally include loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discounts. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investments were on non-accrual status.

 for services provided by the Affiliated Broker-Dealer in connection with the closing of the 2029 Notes. The Affiliated Broker-Dealer may receive fees from other investors and portfolio companies in which the Company invests but will not collect fees from the Company for its portfolio investments. To the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, the Affiliated Broker-Dealer may, among other assignments, arrange, structure, and/or place equity and debt securities to be issued by portfolio companies of the Company on a best efforts or firm commitment basis. These placements may from time to time include structuring of offerings, and placement of securities in public offerings of securities issued by portfolio companies of the Company. The Affiliated Broker-Dealer may act as a firm commitment underwriter (co-manager only) in public and private offerings of securities issued by portfolio companies of the Company. In certain limited circumstances, the Company may have a conflict resulting from the foregoing arrangements. When the Affiliated Broker-Dealer serves as underwriter with respect to the securities of a portfolio company of the Company, the Company may be subject to a lock-up period following the offering under applicable regulations or agreements during which time its ability to sell any securities that it continues to hold is restricted. This restriction may prevent the Company from disposing of such securities at an opportune time. To the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, the Company may make investments from time to time in transactions where the Affiliated Broker-Dealer is acting as agent, broker, principal, arranger or syndicate manager or member on the other side of the transaction or for other parties in the transaction. The consent of the Board may be required to enter into certain of the Company s potential investments and the failure of the Board to grant such consent would prevent the Company from consummating such investments, which could adversely affect the Company.

The Order provides that, in connection with any co-investment transaction, the Company may participate in any such co-investment transaction on terms that are same to those applicable to the other funds managed by, or certain entities affiliated with, the Adviser or certain of its affiliates. To the extent an investment by such other fund or entity, as applicable, in an applicable co-investment opportunity is based on favorable terms, the Company will benefit from investing in such co-investment opportunity based on such favorable terms. In addition, the Order provides that, in connection with any such co-investment transaction, the Company will receive its pro rata share of any transaction fees (including break-up, structuring, monitoring or commitment fees but excluding brokerage or underwriting compensation permitted by section 17(e) or 57(k) of the 1940 Act), in respect of such co-investment transaction, based on the Company s relative share of the amount invested or committed, as applicable, in such transaction. and , respectively.

Unless indicated otherwise, the Company, we, us, and our refer to Stone Point Credit Corporation, and the Adviser refers to Stone Point Credit Adviser LLC, an affiliate of Stone Point Capital LLC Stone Point Capital (together with the Adviser and their other affiliates, collectively, Stone Point ). Overview We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 8, 2020. The Company has elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. As such, we are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets , and tax requirements such as source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income and tax-exempt interest. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has called equity capital in the amount of 1,174.7 million. See Subscriptions and Drawdowns under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further details. Management anticipates calling additional equity capital for investment purposes through drawdowns in respect of capital commitments made by investors pursuant to private placements Private Offering of Common Stock. Investment Objective and Strategy The Company s investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. The Company seeks to invest primarily in senior secured or unsecured loans and, to a lesser extent, subordinated loans, mezzanine loans, and equity-related securities including warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company s common equity. The Company generally expects to invest in middle market companies with earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, between 30 million and 250 million annually. Typical middle market senior loans may be issued by middle market companies in the context of leveraged buyouts, acquisitions, debt refinancings, recapitalizations, and other similar transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Adviser may determine whether companies qualify as middle market in its sole discretion, and the Company may from time to time invest in larger or smaller companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself, especially when there are dislocations in the capital markets, including the high yield and syndicated loan markets. The Company s target credit investments typically have maturities between 3 and 6 years and generally range in size between 20 million and 100 million. The investment size will vary with the size of the Company s capital base. The Company has adopted a non-fundamental policy to invest, under normal market conditions, at least 75 of the value of its total assets (measured at the time of each such investment taking into account certain initial assumptions regarding the expected amount of total assets of the Company once fully invested) in portfolio companies that are in the financial services, business services, software and technology or healthcare services sectors. The remaining 25 of the value of the Company s total assets (measured at the time of each such investment taking into account certain initial assumptions regarding the expected amount of total assets of the Company once fully invested) may be invested across a wide range of sectors (although the Company expects to avoid businesses which at the time of the Company s investment participate in certain sectors such as payday lending, pawn shops, automobile title and tax refund anticipation loans, credit repair services, strip mining, drug paraphernalia, marijuana related businesses, tax evasion gaming and pornography).

 Market Opportunity and Competitive Advantages The Adviser believes the Company presents an attractive investment opportunity for several reasons, including: Increasing Demand for Debt Capital . Private equity sponsors have significant levels of capital available for investment, which the Adviser believes will continue to drive demand for direct lending over the coming years as private equity firms seek to deploy capital through leveraged buyouts. The Company believes this dynamic, coupled with the Adviser s strong relationships in the middle market, will provide significant investment opportunities for the Company. Proactive Sourcing and Relationship-Driven Deal Flow . The Adviser believes that focusing its activities on proactive, outbound, multi-year searches produces higher quality investment opportunities. The Adviser seeks investment opportunities in sectors that it believes are attractive using a focused three-prong origination strategy. In sourcing investments for the Company, the Adviser leverages (i) its dedicated team of origination professionals and Stone Point s broker-dealer professionals focusing on sponsor communities and financial intermediaries within targeted sectors, (ii) its extensive network of private equity investment professionals, focused on more than 75 financial services-related end markets, and (iii) its longstanding relationships with commercial banks who may provide investment opportunities to the Company. Disciplined Underwriting Process . The Adviser seeks investment opportunities that it believes are attractive using a rigorous top-down and bottom-up process. The Adviser regularly evaluates and selects sectors on which to focus based on an investment thesis (top-down approach) and designates a team of investment professionals to identify leading companies and managers in these sectors (bottom-up approach). For more than 70 identified sectors of the financial services industry, this process includes: Firm-wide discussions to prioritize the identified sectors; Dedicating small teams of investment professionals to study these sectors; Interaction with industry experts and attendance at key industry conferences; and Proactive outbound calling efforts and meetings with private equity sponsors and management teams. 
 The Adviser employs a triangulation approach in evaluating the quality of a credit, focused on borrower characteristics, loan structure and quality of sponsorship. The Adviser generally seeks to invest in companies that are led by experienced management teams, have market-leading positions and high barriers to entry, and generate predictable free cash flow across market cycles. In structuring a loan, the Adviser generally focuses on determining appropriate leverage levels (with a significant focus on adjustments and free cash flow), ensuring sufficient minimum sponsor equity and seeking to mitigate downside risk through structural protections. Finally, the Adviser seeks to invest in companies with strong financial sponsor ownership, focused on underwriting a sponsor s ability to support the borrower. Sector Focus . The Company makes its investments primarily in sectors in which Stone Point has developed a longstanding network and can leverage real-time insights from private portfolio companies to provide a discernible origination and underwriting edge. The Adviser currently focuses the Company s investments in the financial services, business services, software and technology, and healthcare services sectors. As a result of this specialization by the investment team at the Adviser, the Adviser believes that it is well positioned to source proprietary deals and evaluate a broad range of investments with a deep understanding of the market dynamics and cycles for these sectors. Further, the Adviser believes the Company s focus on the financial services, business services, software and technology, and healthcare services sectors provides strong downside protection, given the low default rates in these industries, as well as Stone Point s investment experience. The Company s targeted sectors have performed well across market cycles, consistently generating lower cumulative default rates compared with non-financial sectors, which should contribute to enhanced risk-adjusted returns.

 Ability to Leverage Stone Point s Experienced Investment Team . The Adviser intends to utilize Stone Point Capital s significant resources and knowledge throughout the life cycle of each investment to support the Stone Point Credit Investment Team s Credit Activities.

The Investment Committee makes all investment and disposition decisions, subject to Board oversight.

Zerbib, Co-President and CIO Chief Investment Officer of Stone Point Capital Member of the Investment Committee 29 26 Key Components of Operations Investments Our level of investment activity can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. As a BDC, the Company must invest at least 70 of its assets in qualifying assets, which may include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Under the relevant SEC rules, the term eligible portfolio company includes all U.S. private operating companies and small U.S. public operating companies with a market capitalization of less than 250 million. As a BDC, we may also invest up to 30 of our portfolio opportunistically in non-qualifying portfolio investments, such as investments in non-U.S. companies. Revenues The Company expects to generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest and dividend income from its investments. In addition, the Company may generate income from capital gains on the sales of loans and debt and equity related securities and various loan origination and other fees and dividends on direct equity investments. Expenses The Company s day-to-day investment operations are managed by the Adviser, and services necessary for the Company s business, including the origination and administration of its investment portfolio, are provided by individuals who are employees of the Adviser, Administrator, and Sub-Administrator, pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Administration Agreement, and Sub-Administration Agreement. The Company will reimburse the Administrator for its allocable portion of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including its allocable portion of the cost of certain of the Company s officers and their respective staff, and the Adviser for certain expenses under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Company bears its allocable portion of the compensation paid by Stone Point to the Company s Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staff (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the Company s business affairs). The Company bears all other costs and expenses of the Company s operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (i) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) the Company s allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, (iii) fees for services rendered by the Sub-Administrator that the Administrator determines are commercially reasonable; and (iv) all other expenses of its operations and transactions including, without limitation, those relating to: the cost of calculating the Company s net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services;

 the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of the Common Stock and other securities, including, as otherwise noted below, in connection with the Private Offering; fees payable to third parties relating to making investments, including the Adviser s or its affiliates travel expenses, research costs and out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments; interest expense and other costs associated with the Company s indebtedness; transfer agent, dividend reinvestment plan administrator, sub-administrator and custodial fees; out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees; U.S. federal, state and local taxes; Independent Directors fees and expenses; brokerage commissions and markups; fidelity bond, directors and officers liability insurance and other insurance premiums; direct costs, such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; costs associated with the Company s reporting and compliance obligations U.S. federal and state securities laws, including, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act; and other expenses incurred by the Administrator or the Company in connection with administering the Company s business, including payments under the Administration Agreement that will be based upon the Company s allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of the Board) of overhead. 
 The Administrator can waive any amounts owed to it under the Administration Agreement, at its discretion. From time to time, the Adviser and the Administrator or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. The Company will subsequently reimburse the Adviser or the Administrator, as applicable, for such amounts paid on the Company s behalf. The Adviser has agreed to bear the aggregate organizational and offering costs in connection with the Private Offering in excess of 1,250,000. The Company has entered into credit facilities to partially fund the Company s operations, and may incur costs and expenses including commitment, origination, legal and/or structuring fees and the related interest costs associated with any amounts borrowed. See Financing Facilities under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further details. Leverage The amount of leverage that the Company employs will depend on the Adviser s and the Board s assessment of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limitations, BDCs are allowed to borrow amounts such that their asset coverage ratios, as defined in the 1940 Act, are at least 200 (or 150 if certain conditions are met) after such borrowing. As a result of complying with the requirements set forth in Section 61 of the 1940 Act, the Company is able to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage ratio is at least 150 , rather than 200 . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s asset coverage ratio was 196 and 193 , respectively. In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase our leverage over time within the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets or capital commitments as collateral to financing facilities.

 requirements and execution of the company s business plan. In addition, the Adviser s personnel may occupy a seat or serve as an observer on a portfolio company s board of directors or similar governing body. Typically, the Adviser receives financial reports detailing operating performance, sales volumes, margins, cash flows, financial position and other key operating metrics on a quarterly basis from portfolio companies. The Adviser will use this data, combined with the knowledge gained through due diligence of the company s customers, suppliers, competitors, market research and other methods, to conduct an ongoing assessment of the company s operating performance and prospects. As part of the monitoring process, the Adviser rates the risk of all portfolio investments on a scale of 1 to 5, no less frequently than quarterly. This internal performance rating is primarily intended to assess the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to such investments cost taking into account the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The Adviser s internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized rating organization or reflect any third-party assessment. The Adviser s internal performance rating scale is as follows: Investment Performance Rating Description 1 The portfolio company is performing above expectations, and the business trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable. 2 The portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a rating of 2. 3 The portfolio company is performing below expectations and the investment s risk has increased somewhat since origination or acquisition. For debt investments rated 3, the portfolio company could be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, loan payments are generally not past due. 4 The portfolio company is performing materially below expectations and indicates that the investment s risk has increased materially since origination or acquisition. For debt investments rated 4, in addition to the portfolio company being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due. 5 The portfolio company is performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the investment s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. For debt investments rated 5, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. It is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss upon exit of the investment. It is possible that the rating of a portfolio investment may change over time.

Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our Stockholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income, if any, for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our Stockholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. Net Realized Gains (Losses) and Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments The following table summarizes our net realized gains (losses) and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024:

Investor Commitments As of September 30, 2024, the Company had received capital commitments totaling 1,511.3 million, of which, 336.6 million remains unfunded. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had received capital commitments totaling 1,281.1 million, of which, 311.9 million remained unfunded. Contractual Obligations Our payment obligations for repayment of debt, which total our contractual obligations on September 30, 2024, include 85 million of financing under the Capital Call Facility and 225 million of financing under the 2025 Notes maturing in less than one year, and 1,350 million of financing under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Secured Credit Facility and the 2029 Notes maturing in three to five years.

While such transactions may reduce certain risks, such transactions themselves may entail certain other risks. Thus, while the Company may benefit from the use of these hedging mechanisms, unanticipated changes in interest rates, securities prices, currency exchange rates and other factors may result in a poorer overall performance for the Company than if it had not entered into such hedging transactions. The successful utilization of hedging and risk management transactions requires skills that are separate from the skills used in selecting and monitoring investments. There were no hedging transactions through the three months ended September 30, 2024. Critical Accounting Policies This discussion of the Company s operating plan is based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The 

 58 

Table of Contents 
 preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, the Company describes its critical accounting policies in the notes to the Company s consolidated financial statements. Valuation of Investments The Board has designated the Adviser as the Company s Valuation Designee under Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. The Adviser determines the value of the Company s investments in accordance with fair value accounting guidance promulgated under U.S. GAAP, which establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the observability inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the hierarchy for fair value measurements and a description of the Company s valuation procedures. Revenue Recognition The Company records interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that the Company expects to collect such amounts. Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Certain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind PIK interest or dividends. PIK interest and dividends represent accrued interest or dividends that are added to the principal amount or liquidation amount of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or at the occurrence of a liquidation event. The Company does not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities for accounting purposes if the Company has reason to doubt the Company s ability to collect such interest. Original issue discounts, market discounts or premiums are accreted or amortized over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method as interest income. The Company records prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. U.S. Federal Income Taxes The Company has elected to be treated, and intends to qualify annually, to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, the Company generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains distributed to stockholders. To qualify as a RIC, the Company must, among other things, maintain an election under the 1940 Act to be regulated as a BDC, meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements as well as distribute each taxable year dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally of an amount at least equal to 90 of the Company s investment company taxable income, which is generally the Company s net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. See Note 11. Taxes. Recent Developments None. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company is subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate risk. Valuation Risk The Company invests primarily in illiquid debt securities of private companies. Most of the Company s investments do not have a readily available market price, and the Adviser values these investments at fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with procedures approved by the Board. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments the Company makes. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference 

 59 

Table of Contents 
 between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. As of September 30, 2024, 99.5 of our debt investments based on fair value were at floating rates. Our credit facilities, including our Capital Call Facility, Revolving Credit Facility and Secured Credit Facility, also bear interest at floating rates. Based on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the approximate annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors and assuming no changes in our investment portfolio and borrowing structure): 

Change in Net Investment Basis point change Interest Income (1) Interest Expense Income (Loss) 300 70,685,724 (26,010,000) 44,675,724 200 47,123,816 (17,340,000) 29,783,816 100 23,561,908 (8,670,000) 14,891,908 (100) (23,561,908) 8,670,000 (14,891,908) (200) (47,123,816) 17,340,000 (29,783,816) (300) (70,685,724) 26,010,000 (44,675,724) 

 (1) Assumes no defaults or prepayments by portfolio companies over the next twelve months. 
 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments. We did not engage in interest rate hedging activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the most recent fiscal quarter, there was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting, as defined under Rule 13a-a(f) under the Exchange Act, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

(ii) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Advances made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered. (iii) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate, and the basis for such compensation of, such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 20 days after receipt thereof. (iv) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or the Administrative Agent s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Administrative Agent notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or the Administrative Agent s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. (v) Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent agrees that it will take such commercially reasonable actions as the Company may reasonably request that will avoid the need 

- 49 - 
 to pay, or reduce the amount of, any increased amounts referred to in this Section 3.01(f); provided that no Lender or the Administrative Agent shall be obligated to take any actions that would, in the reasonable opinion of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, be disadvantageous to such Lender or the Administrative Agent (including, without limitation, due to a loss of money). In no event will the Company be responsible for increased amounts referred to in this Section 3.01(f) which relates to any other entities to which any Lender provides financing. (vi) If any Lender (A) provides notice of unlawfulness or requests compensation under clause (e) above or this clause (f), (B) is a Defaulting Lender under the definition of such term (or, in the case of a requirement to assign or delegate interests, rights and obligations as set forth below, is otherwise a Defaulting Lender), (C) becomes subject to a Bail-In Action, or (D) does not consent to a Material Amendment consented to by the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon written notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, prepay the Advance of such Lender or require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related transaction documents to an assignee identified by the Company that shall assume such obligations (whereupon such Lender shall be obligated to so assign), provided that, (x) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder through the date of such assignment, (y) a Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply and (z) such assignment or delegation shall be offered first to JPMCB and any affiliate thereof that is a Lender. No prepayment fee that may otherwise be due hereunder shall be payable to such Lender in connection with any such prepayment or assignment. (g) No Set-off or counterclaim . Subject to Section 3.03, all payments to be made hereunder by the Company in respect of the Advances shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and in such amounts as may be necessary in order that every such payment (after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future Taxes imposed by the jurisdiction in which the Company is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority therein or thereof) shall not be less than the amounts otherwise specified to be paid under this Agreement. SECTION 3.02. Interest Rate Unascertainable, Inadequate or Unfair . (a) Subject to clauses (b), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this Section 3.02 (in the case of Advances denominated in a Permitted Non-USD Currency), if prior to the commencement of any Calculation Period for an Advance: (i) the Administrative Agent determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining a Reference Rate or Term SOFR Reference Rate (including, without limitation, because such Reference Rate or Term SOFR Reference Rate is not available or published on a current basis) for the applicable Currency and such Calculation Period; provided that, with respect to any Reference Rate, no Benchmark Transition Event shall have occurred at such time; or (ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the applicable Reference Rate or Term SOFR Reference Rate for the applicable Currency and such Calculation Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or 

- 50 - 
 Lender) of making or maintaining their Advances (or its Advance) included in such Advance for such Calculation Period; then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company, the Portfolio Manager, the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company, the Portfolio Manager, the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, if any Advance denominated in such Currency is requested to be made by the Lenders or is then outstanding, it shall thereupon constitute a Base Rate Advance. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders and the Company without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. (c) [Reserved]. (d) In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right, in consultation with the Company, to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time by delivery of a notice of such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes referred to in Section 3.02(e) below and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except as expressly required pursuant to this Section 3.02. (e) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Company, the Lenders and the Collateral Agent in writing (including via email) of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (f) below and (v) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 3.02, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 3.02. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to 

- 51 - 
 time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Calculation Period for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Calculation Period for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. (g) Upon the Company s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Company may revoke any request for an Advance in conversion to or continuation of Advances in the applicable Currency to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Company will be deemed to have converted any request for an Advance into a request for a Base Rate Advance or conversion of an outstanding Advance to a Base Rate Advance. SECTION 3.03. Taxes . (a) Payments Free of Taxes . All payments to be made hereunder by the Company in respect of the Advances shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law (including FATCA). If any Applicable Law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Company, then the Company shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Company shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding in respect of Indemnified Taxes been made. (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Company . The Company shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. (c) Indemnification by the Company . The Company shall indemnify each Lender, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Lender and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) Indemnification by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Company has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of 10.06 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each 

- 52 - 
 case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d). (e) Evidence of Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Company to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.03(f) (ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), an executed IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be reasonably requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, an executed IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or applicable successor form establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, an IRS Form W-8BEN or

Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Original Effective Date. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. (E) The Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Company an electronic copy of an IRS Form W-9 upon becoming a party under this Agreement.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after- Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. (h) Survival . Each party s obligations under this Section 3.03 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Financing Commitments, and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
