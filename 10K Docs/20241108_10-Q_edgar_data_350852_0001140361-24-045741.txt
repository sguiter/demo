of total loans. This industry has unique risk characteristics as it is highly susceptible to changes in the domestic and global economic environments, which can cause the
 industry to experience substantial volatility. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Hotel/motel lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these
 loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Management monitors and evaluates all commercial real estate loans based on collateral and risk
 grade criteria. Commercial construction loans generally are made to customers for the purpose of building income-producing properties, and any hotel/motel construction loan would be included in this segment. Personal guarantees of the principals
 are generally required. Such loans are made on a projected cash flow basis and are secured by the project being constructed. Construction loan draw procedures are included in each specific loan agreement, including required documentation items and
 inspection requirements. Construction loans may convert to term loans at the end of the construction period, or may be repaid by the take-out commitment from another financing source. If the loan is to convert to a term loan, the repayment ability
 is based on the borrower s projected cash flow. Risk is mitigated during the construction phase by requiring proper documentation and inspections whenever a draw is requested.

N oninterest expense for the quarter ended
 September 30, 2024 of 32.5 million was 0.1 million, or 0.3 , above prior quarter and 1.7 million, or 5.4 , above prior year same quarter. The increase year over year primarily resulted from a 1.5 million
 increase in personnel expense, which included a 0.6 million increase in salaries and a 0.7 million increase in the cost of group medical and life insurance benefits. Other n oninterest expense was positively impacted by the
 accounting method change related to investments in tax credit structures (ASU No. 2023-02). Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 97.2 million compared to 93.8 million for
 the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 

Balance Sheet Review 

CTBI s total assets at September 30, 2024 of 6.0 billion increased 158.6 million, or an annualized 10.9 , from June 30, 2024 and 193.3 million,
 or an annualized 4.5 , from December 31, 2023. Loans outstanding at September 30, 2024 were 4.4 billion, an increase of 89.2 million, or an annualized 8.3 , from June 30, 2024 and 299.6 million, or an annualized 9.9 , from December 31, 2023. 
 The increase in loans from prior quarter included a 62.3 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio and a 33.7 million increase in the residential loan portfolio, partially offset by a 3.5 million decrease in the indirect consumer loan
 portfolio and a 3.3 million decrease in the consumer direct loan portfolio. CTBI s investment portfolio increased 8.0 million, or an annualized 2.9 , from June 30, 2024 but decreased 65.6 million, or an annualized 7.5 , from December 31,
 2023. Deposits in other banks increased 48.3 million from prior quarter but decreased 57.6 million from December 31, 2023. Deposits, including repurchase agreements, at 5.1 billion increased 110.2 million, or an annualized 8.8 , from June
 30, 2024 and 121.7 million, or an annualized 3.3 , from December 31, 2023. CTBI is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers for its source of deposits. As of September 30, 2024, no one
 customer accounted for more than 3 of our 5.1 billion in deposits. Only two customer relationships accounted for more than 1 each .

Shareholders equity at 760.8 million increased 41.4 million, or an annualized 22.9 , during the quarter and 58.6 million, or an annualized
 11.1 , from December 31, 2023. Net unrealized losses on securities, net of deferred taxes, were 80.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 107.1 million at June 30, 2024 and 103.3 million at December 31, 2023.

Asset Quality

Our total nonperforming loans increased to 25.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 19.8 million at June 30, 2024 and 14.0 million at December
 31, 2023. Accruing loans 90+ days past due at 19.1 million increased 4.4 million from prior quarter and 9.2 million from December 31, 2023. Nonaccrual loans at 6.0 million increased 0.9 million from prior quarter and 1.9 million from
 December 31, 2023. Accruing loans 30-89 days past due at 20.6 million decreased 3.5 million from prior quarter but increased 5.2 million from December 31, 2023. Our loan portfolio management processes focus on the immediate identification,
 management, and resolution of problem loans to maximize recovery and minimize loss. Our loan portfolio risk management processes include weekly delinquent loan review meetings at the market levels and monthly delinquent loan review meetings
 involving senior corporate management to review all nonaccrual loans and loans 30 days or more past due. Any activity regarding a criticized/classified loan (i.e. problem loan) must be approved by CTB s Watch List Asset Committee (i.e. Problem
 Loan Committee). CTB s Watch List Asset Committee also meets on a quarterly basis and reviews every criticized/classified loan of 100,000 or greater. CTB s Loan Portfolio Risk Management Committee also meets quarterly focusing on the overall
 asset quality and risk metrics of the loan portfolio. We also have a Loan Review Department that reviews every market within CTB annually and performs extensive testing of the loan portfolio to assure the accuracy of loan grades and
 classifications for delinquency, if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty with significant payment delay, nonaccrual status, and adequate loan loss reserves. The Loan Review Department has annually reviewed, on average, 97 of the
 outstanding commercial loan portfolio for the past three years. The average annual review percentage of the consumer and residential loan portfolio for the past three years was 81 based on the loan production during the number of months
 included in the review scope. The review scope is generally four to six months of production. CTBI generally does not offer high risk loans such as option ARM products, high loan to value ratio mortgages, interest-only loans, loans with initial
 teaser rates, or loans with negative amortizations, and therefore, CTBI would have no significant exposure to these products.

For further information regarding nonperforming loans, see Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein.

We had net loan charge-offs of 1.5 million, or 0.14 of average loans annualized, for the third quarter 2024 compared to 1.4 million, or 0.13 
 of average loans annualized, for the second quarter 2024 and 1.2 million, or 0.12 of average loans annualized, for the third quarter 2023. Of the net charge-offs for the quarter, 1.2 million were in indirect consumer loans, 0.2 million were
 in direct consumer loans, and 0.1 million were in residential loans. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.5 million, or 0.14 of average loans annualized, compared to 2.3 million, or 0.08 of average loans
 annualized, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Year-to-date net loan charge-offs are in line with management s expectations.

Liquidity and Market Risk

The objective of CTBI s Asset/Liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within our policy limits. 
 This objective is accomplished through management of our consolidated balance sheet composition, liquidity, and interest rate risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions, interest rates, and customer preferences. The goal of
 liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand or deposit withdrawals. This is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investment securities, sufficient
 unused borrowing capacity, and growth in core deposits. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 240.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately 186.0 million in unpledged
 securities valued at estimated fair value designated as available-for-sale and available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis compared to 271.4 million and 157.5 million at December 31, 2023. Additional asset-driven liquidity is
 provided by the remainder of the securities portfolio and the repayment of loans. In addition to core deposit funding, we also have a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources available. We also rely on Federal Home Loan Bank
 advances for both liquidity and management of our asset/liability position. Federal Home Loan Bank advances were 0.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had a 517.1 million available borrowing
 position with the Federal Home Loan Bank, compared to 476.2 million at December 31, 2023. We generally rely upon net inflows of cash from financing activities, supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities, to provide cash for
 our investing activities. As is typical of many financial institutions, significant financing activities include deposit gathering, use of short-term borrowing facilities such as repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased, and issuance of
 long-term debt. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 50 million in lines of credit with various correspondent banks available to meet any future cash needs. Our primary investing activities include purchases of securities and
 loan originations. We do not rely on any one source of liquidity and manage availability in response to changing consolidated balance sheet needs. Included in our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were deposits with the Federal
 Reserve of 146.3 million, compared to 207.6 million at December 31, 2023. Additionally, we project cash flows from our investment portfolio to generate additional liquidity over the next 90 days.

The investment portfolio consists of investment grade short-term issues suitable for bank investments. The majority of the investment portfolio
 is in U.S. government and government sponsored agency issuances. At September 30, 2024, available-for-sale AFS securities comprised all of the total investment portfolio, and the AFS portfolio was
 approximately 144 of equity capital. Eighty-four percent of the pledge-eligible portfolio was pledged.

Interest Rate Risk

We consider interest rate risk one of our most significant market risks. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest
 income due to changes in interest rates. Consistency of our net interest revenue is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. We employ a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage our interest rate
 risk, including the use of an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates. The model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off-balance sheet instruments and
 incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities. Assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in
 interest rates are also incorporated into the model. These assumptions are inherently uncertain, and as a result, the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net
 interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies.

CTBI s Asset/Liability Management Committee (ALCO), which includes executive and senior management representatives and reports to the Board of
 Directors, monitors and manages interest rate risk within Board-approved policy limits. Our current exposure to interest rate risks is determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income spread evenly over the twelve-month
 period.

Capital Resources

We continue to offer a dividend to our shareholders, providing an annualized dividend yield for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 of 3.79 . 
 Our primary source of capital growth is the retention of earnings. Cash dividends were 1.39 per share and 1.34 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We retained 58.6 of our earnings for the first nine
 months of 2024 compared to 59.6 for the first nine months of 2023.

Insured depository institutions are required to meet certain capital level requirements. On October 29, 2019, federal banking regulators
 adopted a final rule to simplify the regulatory capital requirements for eligible community banks and holding companies that opt-in to the community bank leverage ratio framework (the CBLR framework ), as required by Section 201 of the
 Economic Growth, Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. Under the final rule, which became effective as of January 1, 2020, community banks and holding companies (which includes CTB and CTBI) that satisfy certain qualifying criteria,
 including having less than 10 billion in average total consolidated assets and a leverage ratio (referred to as the community bank leverage ratio of greater than 9 , were eligible to opt-in to the CBLR framework. The community bank
 leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization s Tier 1 capital to its average total consolidated assets, both as reported on the banking organization s applicable regulatory filings. Accordingly, a qualifying community banking
 organization that has a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9 will be considered to have met: (i) the risk-based and leverage capital requirements of the generally applicable capital rules; (ii) the capital ratio requirements in order
 to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework; and (iii) any other applicable capital or leverage requirements.

In April 2020, as directed by Section 4012 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the regulatory agencies introduced
 temporary changes to the CBLR. These changes, which subsequently were adopted as a final rule, temporarily reduced the CBLR requirement to 8 through the end of calendar year 2020. Beginning in calendar year 2021, the CBLR requirement
 increased to 8.5 for the calendar year before returning to 9 in calendar year 2022. Management elected to use the CBLR framework for CTBI and CTB. CTBI s CBLR ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 13.99 . CTB s CBLR ratio as of September 30,
 2024 was 13.51 .

As of September 30, 2024, we are not aware of any current recommendations by banking regulatory authorities which, if they were to be implemented,
 would have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material adverse impact on our liquidity, capital resources, or operations.

Impact of Inflation, Changing Prices, and Economic Conditions

The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Therefore, CTBI differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies
 that have significant investment in nonmonetary assets, such as fixed assets and inventories. However, inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital
 at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio. Inflation also affects other expenses, which tend to rise during periods of general inflation.

We believe one of the most significant impacts on financial and operating results is our ability to react to changes in interest rates. We seek
 to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations.

Stock Repurchase Program

CTBI s stock repurchase program began in December 1998 with the authorization to acquire up to 500,000 shares and was increased by an additional
 1,000,000 shares in each of July 2000, May 2003, and March 2020. CTBI repurchased 32,664 shares of its common stock during the first quarter 2020, leaving 1,034,706 shares remaining under our current repurchase authorization. As of September
 30, 2024, a total of 2,465,294 shares have been repurchased through this program.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 GAAP requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies, many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related
 notes. Since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty, the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates. Such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements.

We believe the application of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable. These accounting policies and estimates are
 constantly reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. Historically, we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate, and actual results have not differed materially from those
 determined using necessary estimates.

65 

Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein. We have identified the
 following critical accounting policies:

Allowance for Credit Losses CTBI accounts for the ACL and the reserve for unfunded commitments in accordance with ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit
 Losses on Financial Instruments , and its related subsequent amendments, commonly known as CECL. 

We disaggregate our portfolio loans into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ACL. Our loan portfolio segments include commercial,
 residential mortgage, and consumer. We further disaggregate our portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. For an analysis of CTBI s ACL by portfolio segment
 and credit quality information by class, refer to Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein.

CTBI maintains the ACL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related
 loans. Effective January 1, 2023, CTBI implemented ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures , an amendment to ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The amendments in this ASU eliminate the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by
 creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors , while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower
 is experiencing financial difficulty along with requiring that disclosures be added by year of origination for gross charge-off information for financing receivables. Accrued interest receivable on loans is presented in the consolidated
 financial statements as a component of other assets. When accrued interest is deemed to be uncollectible (typically when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status), interest income is reversed. In the event that collection of principal becomes
 uncertain, CTBI has policies in place to reverse accrued interest in a timely manner. Therefore, CTBI elected ASU 2019-04 which allows that accrued interest would continue to be presented separately and not part of the amortized cost of the
 loan. For additional information on CTBI s accounting policies related to nonaccrual loans, refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein.

Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ACL. The ACL is maintained at a level CTBI considers to be adequate and is based on
 ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability of loans, including historical credit loss experience, current and forecasted market and economic conditions, and consideration of various qualitative factors that, in
 management s judgment, deserve consideration in estimating expected credit losses. Provisions for credit losses are recorded for the amounts necessary to adjust the ACL to CTBI s current estimate of expected credit losses on portfolio loans. 
 CTBI s strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation, and collection standards. The strategy also emphasizes
 diversification on a geographic, industry, and customer level, regular credit examinations, and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality.

CTBI s methodology for determining the ACL requires significant management judgment and includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a
 collective basis for groups of loans with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans which are individually evaluated.

66 

Larger commercial loans with balances exceeding 1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses and (i) have a criticized risk
 rating, (ii) are on nonaccrual status, (iii) have a borrower experiencing financial difficulty with significant payment delay, or (iv) are 90 days or more past due, are individually evaluated for an ACL. CTBI considers the current value of
 collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantor s liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and other factors when determining the amount of the ACL. Other factors may include the borrower s susceptibility to risks
 presented by the forecasted macroeconomic environment, the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower, and our evaluation of the borrower s management. 
 Significant management judgment is required when evaluating which of these factors are most relevant in individual circumstances, and when estimating the amount of expected credit losses based on those factors. When loans are individually
 evaluated, allowances are determined based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to CTBI. 
 Allowances for individually evaluated loans that are collateral-dependent are typically measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less expected costs to sell where applicable. For collateral-dependent financial assets, the
 credit loss expected may be zero if the fair value less costs to sell exceeds the amortized cost of the loan. Loans shall not be included in both collective assessments and individual assessments. Individually evaluated loans that are not
 collateral-dependent are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate. Specific allowances on individually evaluated commercial loans, including loans to borrowers
 experiencing financial difficulty, are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. Regardless of an initial measurement method, once it is
 determined that foreclosure is probable, the ACL is measured based on the fair value of the collateral as of the measurement date. As a practical expedient, the fair value of the collateral may be used for a loan when determining the ACL for
 which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The fair value shall be adjusted for selling costs when foreclosure is probable.

Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans that are not individually evaluated. These include commercial loans that do
 not meet the criteria for individual evaluation as well as homogeneous loans in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments. CTBI uses a third party ACL software to calculate reserve estimates. Discounted cash flow DCF modeling
 was used for all loan segments. The primary reasons that contributed to this decision were: DCF models allow for the effective incorporation of a reasonable and supportable forecast in a directionally consistent and objective manner; the
 analysis aligns well with other calculations outside of the ACL estimation which will mitigate model risk in other areas; and peer data is available for certain inputs if first party data is not available or meaningful. Expected credit losses
 are estimated on a collective basis for loans that are not individually evaluated. These include commercial loans that do not meet the criteria for individual evaluation as well as homogeneous loans in the residential mortgage and consumer
 portfolio segments. See Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein for information on CTBI s risk rating system.

CTBI s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, peer data, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted
 changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. Generally, CTBI considers our forecasts to be reasonable and supportable for a period of up to one year from the estimation date. For periods
 beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, expected credit losses are estimated by reverting to historical loss information. CTBI evaluates the length of our reasonable and supportable forecast period, our reversion period, and
 reversion methodology at least annually, or more often if warranted by economic conditions or other circumstances.

Other qualitative factors are used by CTBI in determining the ACL. These considerations inherently require significant management judgment to
 determine the appropriate factors to be considered and the extent of their impact on the ACL estimate. Qualitative factors are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses but that are not fully captured
 within CTBI s expected credit loss models. These include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel, and results of internal audit and quality control
 reviews. These may also include adjustments, when deemed necessary, for specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters and their effects on regional borrowers, and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors
 may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within CTBI s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information, or changes to
 the reversion period or methodology. When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is also given to regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect that changing economic conditions may have on CTBI s customers.

67 

Overall, the collective evaluation process requires significant management judgment when determining the estimation methodology and inputs into
 the models, as well as in evaluating the reasonableness of the modeled results and the appropriateness of qualitative adjustments. CTBI s forecasts of market and economic conditions and the internal risk grades assigned to loans in the
 commercial portfolio segment are examples of inputs to the expected credit loss models that require significant management judgment. These inputs have the potential to drive significant variability in the resulting ACL.

The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected credit losses
 related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the
 commitments, taking into consideration the current funded balance and estimated exposure over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of
 the adequacy of CTBI s ACL, as previously discussed. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income.

Goodwill Business
 combinations entered into by CTBI typically include the recognition of goodwill. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on
 an annual basis, which for CTBI is October 1, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein for a discussion on the
 methodology used by CTBI to assess goodwill for impairment. 

Impairment exists when a reporting unit s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In testing goodwill
 for impairment, GAAP permits companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. In this qualitative assessment, CTBI evaluates events and
 circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of CTBI, and the performance of CTBI s common stock, to determine if it is not
 more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the quantitative impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected, CTBI performs the goodwill impairment test by comparing
 its fair value with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill recorded. A recognized
 impairment loss cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers.

The fair value of CTBI is the price that would be received to sell the company as a whole in an orderly transaction between
 market participants at the measurement date. The determination of the fair value is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable
 control premium. CTBI employs an income-based approach, utilizing forecasted cash flows and the estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of the forecasted cash flows
 surrounding expectations for earnings projections, growth and credit loss expectations, and actual results may differ from forecasted results.

Fair Value Measurements As a financial services company, the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities is impacted by the application of fair value measurements, either directly or indirectly. In certain cases, an asset or liability is
 measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis, such as available-for-sale investment securities. In other cases, management must rely on estimates or judgments to determine if an asset or liability not measured at fair value
 warrants an impairment write-down or whether a valuation reserve should be established. Given the inherent volatility, the use of fair value measurements may have a significant impact on the carrying value of assets or liabilities or result in
 material changes to the consolidated financial statements from period to period. Detailed information regarding fair value measurements can be found in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest rate risk management focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within Board-approved policy limits. CTBI uses an
 earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates. Given a 200 basis point increase to the yield curve used in the simulation model, it is estimated net interest income for CTBI would increase by
 1.11 over one year and 2.08 over two years. A 200 basis point decrease in the yield curve would decrease net interest income by an estimated 2.57 over one year and 5.65 over two years. For further discussion of CTBI s market risk, see the
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Market Risk included in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
