NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The
condensed statements included herein have been prepared by the registrant, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement
of the results of operations for the interim period, on a basis consistent with the annual audited statements. The adjustments made to
these condensed statements consist only of normal recurring adjustments. Certain information, accounting policies, and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP)
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the registrant believes that the disclosures are adequate
to make the information presented not misleading. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and the summary of significant accounting policies and notes thereto included in the registrant s latest

of . 

The
Partnership is continuing its orderly liquidation process per the terms of Partnership Agreement as the Partnership s term expired
November 30, 2023. The Partnership had been in the business of owning and operating its investment portfolio of commercial real estate
properties (the Properties since the late 1980 s. The Partnership has sold six Properties in the last two years.
The three remaining Properties currently owned by the Partnership are leased on a triple net basis to, and operated by, franchisees of
the International Wendy s Company under leases with terms through December 31, 2040. As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership
owned Properties, which are all located in South Carolina. 

The
Partnership Agreement (as defined below) provides that the Partnership is scheduled to be dissolved on November 30, 2023, or earlier
upon the prior occurrence of any of the following events: (a) the disposition of all its Properties; (b) the written determination by
the General Partner, that the Partnership s assets may constitute plan assets for purposes of ERISA; (c) the agreement
of limited partners owning a majority of the outstanding Interests to dissolve the Partnership; or (d) the dissolution, bankruptcy, death,
withdrawal, or incapacity of the last remaining General Partner, unless an additional General Partner is elected previously by a majority
of the limited partners. 

Pursuant
to a consent solicitation that concluded on October 15, 2020, the Partnership solicited and obtained the affirmative consent of limited
partners holding more than a majority of the Partnership s outstanding Interests to authorize the General Partner, to sell the
Properties prior to November 30, 2023 if the General Partner determined such sale to be in the best interest of the Partnership and,
upon the sale of all Properties, to commence an orderly liquidation, wind-up and dissolution of the Partnership. In connection with such
consent, the limited partners approved a resolution granting the General Partner the authority to sell all or substantially all of the
Partnership s assets prior to November 30, 2023 and subsequently liquidate and dissolve the Partnership, without further approval
from the limited partners. On August 25, 2023, the General Partner adopted resolutions determining that it is in the best interest of
the Partnership to sell all or substantially all of the Partnership s assets, and providing that the General Partner will, upon
the sale of such assets, liquidate and dissolve the Partnership in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the Partnership Agreement.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 the General Partner caused the Partnership to dispose of five of its now former Properties,
and thereafter and through the quarter ended September 30, 2024 continued to pursue the orderly disposition of the Partnership s
remaining Properties.

Both the Base Fee and Expenses reimbursement are subject to annual Consumer Price Index based adjustments. Effective March 1, 2021, the
General Partner elected to roll back the last five years of CPI increases to their 2016 level and suspend any future CPI adjustments
for the base fee. Therefore, the minimum Base Fee was annually in 2023. In addition, the maximum annual Expenses reimbursement
remained at and any potential future CPI adjustments had been suspended. Effective January 1, 2024, Management has elected to
reduce the Base Fee from per month to per month for the first nine months of 2024. Management intends to continue to
reduce the Base Fee as the liquidation and wind down process continues. The annual Expense reimbursement was also reduced from 
per month to per month for calendar year 2024. The General Partner continues to evaluate these costs in light of the winding up
of the Partnership and liquidation of its assets. 

For
purposes of computing the overall fee paid to the General Partner, gross receipts include amounts recovered in connection with the
misappropriation of assets by the former general partners and their affiliates. The fee received by the General Partner from the Partnership
on any amounts recovered reduce the four percent minimum fee by that same amount.

and fifty percent of the previously escrowed amounts would be paid to TPG. At such time as the recovery exceeded in the
aggregate, the remaining escrowed disposition fees were to be paid to TPG. If such levels of recovery were not achieved, TPG would
contribute the amounts escrowed toward the recovery until the three original partnerships were made whole. In lieu of a disposition

the recovery level of was exceeded, fifty percent of the total disposition fee amount paid to the three original
partnerships recovery through the restoration account (in lieu of the disposition fee escrow) was refunded to TPG during March 1996.
The remaining fifty percent amount allocated to the Partnership through the restoration account, and which was previously reflected
as Partnership recovery income, may be owed to TPG if the recovery level is met. As of September 30, 2024, TPG does not

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements
are not historical facts but are the intent, belief or current expectations of management of the Partnership based on its knowledge and
understanding of the business and industry. Words such as may, anticipates, expects, intends, 
 plans, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, 
 should and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that these expectations
will prove to have been correct. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and
other factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from
those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. 

Examples
of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding: 

our
 expectations regarding our financial condition, results of operations in future periods, and matters related to the timing to wind-up
 the Partnership s operations; 

our
 expectations regarding the timing and efforts to satisfy existing or potential Partnership obligations as we wind-up the Partnership; 

our
 expectations regarding economic and business conditions and how conditions could impact the wind-up of the Partnership; 

our
 decisions and policies with respect to the potential disposition of our remaining assets as we wind-up the Partnership; 

costs
 and expenses to complete the wind-up and dissolution of the Partnership; 

our
 ability to collect on any remaining obligations owed to the Partnership; 

any
 contingent liabilities related to our former Properties or other Partnership matters; and 

other
 risks and uncertainties described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates, including investment impairment. These estimates are based on management s historical
industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
from these estimates, and the difference could be material. 

See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our significant accounting policies.

Properties prior to November 30, 2023 if the General Partner determined such sale to be in the best interest of the Partnership and,
upon the sale of all Properties, to commence an orderly liquidation, wind-up and dissolution of the Partnership. In connection with such
consent, the limited partners approved a resolution granting the General Partner the authority to sell all or substantially all of the
Partnership s assets prior to November 30, 2023, and subsequently liquidate and dissolve the Partnership, without further approval
from the limited partners. 

On
August 25, 2023, the General Partner adopted resolutions (a) determining that it is in the best interest of the Partnership to sell all
or substantially all of the Partnership s assets, and (b) providing that the General Partner will, upon the sale of such assets,
liquidate and dissolve the Partnership in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the Partnership Agreement. In addition, the
stated term of the Partnership ended on November 30, 2023, and, prior to that date the Partnership did not seek or obtain the consent
of the limited partners to amend the Partnership Agreement to extend the Partnership s term. As a result of the authority and authorization
provided to the General Partner, and because the Partnership s intended term lapsed on November 30, 2023, during the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2023 the General Partner caused the Partnership to dispose of five of its now former Properties and expects to continue
to pursue and effect the orderly disposition of the Partnership s remaining Properties. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Partnership owned three Properties, all of which feature tenants that are Wendy s franchisees. The Properties
are all located in the state of South Carolina and included in Properties held for sale. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 the Partnership
closed on the sale of its final three Properties, and going forward the General Partner intends to continue to the orderly wind-up of
the Partnership. 

Property
taxes, general maintenance, insurance and ground rent on the Properties are the responsibility of the tenant. However, when a tenant
fails to make the required tax payments or when a Property becomes vacant, the Partnership makes the appropriate property tax payments
to avoid possible foreclosure of the Property. 

There
were no building improvements capitalized during the three month period ending September 30, 2024. 

Net
Income 

Net income for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
was 36,886 and 4,344,198 , respectively. Net income per limited partnership interest for the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.79 and 92.93, respectively. Net income for the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 was 58,369 and 5,648,248 , respectively. Net income per limited partnership interest
for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1.25 and 120.82 , respectively. 

The
decrease in net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the net income for the prior year periods
is primarily the net effect of the sale of the Martintown Road Property on March 31, 2023 (with no corresponding Property sale in the
2024 periods), and lower rental income resulting from the Partnership owning fewer rental Properties (as described below). See paragraphs
below for further information as to the primary factors that contributed to the variances in operating income and expense items from
the 2023 periods to the 2024 periods.

Results
of Operations 

Three-month
period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023: 

Operating
Rental Income: Rental income for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 117,587 and 309,010 respectively.
The rental income was comprised of monthly lease obligations. The decrease in rental income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024
compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 is due to the loss in rents associated with the five Properties that were sold in the
fourth quarter of 2023. 

General
and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were
 4,881 and 149,503, respectively. General and administrative expenses were comprised of management expense, state/city registration
and annual report filing fees, office supplies, printing costs, outside storage expenses, copying costs, postage and shipping expenses,
website fees, bank fees and state income tax expenses. The decrease for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter
ended September 30, 2023 is due primarily to the reduction in the management fee and overhead allowance, as well as the change in treatment
for 2023 state income taxes due for the 2023 tax year, which were accrued during the 2023 tax year instead of being expensed when paid
as had been the practice in prior years. 

Professional
Services: Professional services expenses for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 27,520 and 30,506 respectively.
Professional services expenses were primarily comprised of investor relations data processing, investor mailings processing, outsourced
financial services, legal, auditing and tax preparation fees, and SEC report conversion and processing fees. The decrease for the quarter
ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 is due primarily to our decreased use of outside financial
advisors and other professionals during the 2024 period as we curtailed our reliance on outside service providers as part of our wind-up
activities. 

Nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023: 

Income
from operations for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 58,369 and 5,648,248 respectively. The 2023 period included the sale of one Property during that period, whereas there were no Property sales during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Operating
Rental Income: Rental income for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 352,761 and 907,706,
respectively. The rental income was comprised of monthly lease obligations. The decrease from the 2023 period to the 2024 period is due
to the loss in rents associated with the five Properties that were sold during calendar year 2023 after September 30, 2023. 

General
and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were
 20,873 and 224,991, respectively. General and administrative expenses
were comprised of management expense, state/city registration and annual report filing fees, office supplies, printing costs, outside
storage expenses, copying costs, postage and shipping expenses, website fees, bank fees, and state income tax expenses. The decrease
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is due primarily to the reduction in
the management fee and overhead allowance, as well as the change in treatment for 2023 state income taxes due for the 2023 tax year,
which were accrued during the 2023 tax year instead of being expensed when paid as had been the practice in prior years. 

Professional
services: Professional services expenses for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 150,593 and 123,239,
respectively. Professional services expenses were primarily comprised of investor relations data processing, investor mailings processing,
outsourced financial services, legal, auditing and tax preparation fees, and SEC report conversion and processing fees. The increase
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is due primarily to an increase in
outsourced financial services fees upon reclassification from management fees in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, as amended. 

Cash
Flow Analysis 

Net
cash flows from operating activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were (593) and 810,379,
respectively. The decrease is attributed primarily to lower net income (net of the gain on the sale of property during the 2023 period)
during the 2024 period versus the 2023 period in addition to the state income tax payments to Ohio, South Carolina and Georgia totaling
 441,588 in the first quarter attributable to 2023 income. 

16 

Cash
flows provided from investing activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 97,301 and 6,221,659, respectively.
The 2024 amount represents the net of interest earned on the indemnification trust account offset by a withdrawal from the indemnification
trust to support state income tax payments made on behalf of Limited Partners. The 2023 amount represents the proceeds from the sale
of the Partnership s former Martintown Road property that was sold during the 2023 period offset partially by interest earned on
the indemnification trust account. 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, cash flows used in financing activities was 235,555 and consisted of aggregate limited
partner distributions of 234,495 and general partner distributions of 1,060. 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, cash flows used in financing activities was 1,880,849 and consisted of aggregate limited
partner distributions of 1,875,001, and general partner distributions of 5,848. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Partnership s cash balance was 40,898 at September 30, 2024. This balance represents amounts deemed necessary to allow the Partnership
to operate normally. 

The
Partnership s principal demands for liquidity are expected to continue to be, for the payment of operating expenses, assumption
of Limited Partner state income taxes and distributions to Limited Partners. Management anticipates that cash generated through the sales
of Properties will primarily provide the sources for future Partnership liquidity and limited partner distributions. The two primary
liquidity risks in the absence of mortgage debt with respect to the liquidating operations of the Properties and their eventual sale,
are the Partnership s inability to collect rent receivables and completing anticipated sales of the remaining Properties. The amount
of cash to be distributed to our limited partners is determined by the General Partner and is dependent on a number of factors, including
funds available for payment of operating expenses during liquidation and state income tax payments related to the sales of the remaining
Properties in the portfolio. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the three owned Properties were 100 leased. In addition, the Partnership collected 100 of its base rent that
was owing from current operating tenants for the period ended September 30, 2024 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which we
believe is a good indication of overall tenant quality and stability. 

There
were no leases set to expire in 2024.
