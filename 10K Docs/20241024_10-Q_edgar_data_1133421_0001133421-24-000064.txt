Accounting Estimates 
 Revenue Recognition 
 B-21 Program 
 In 2015, the U.S. Air Force awarded Northrop Grumman the B-21 contract, which includes a base contract for engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) and five low-rate initial production (LRIP) options for a baseline total of 21 aircraft. The EMD phase of the program is largely cost type and began at contract award. The LRIP options are largely fixed price and are expected to continue to be awarded and executed through approximately the end of the decade. In addition to the five LRIP options, Northrop Grumman and the U.S. Air

 billion across the five LRIP options. During the third quarter of 2024, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the program and made no significant changes to the previously recognized loss. The company s third quarter 2024 results reflect our current best estimate of our cost to complete the LRIP and NTE aircraft, as well as the outcome of ongoing discussions with our suppliers and our customer. If our estimated cost to complete the aircraft changes or our assumptions regarding contract performance, quantities, or funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions are resolved more or less favorably than what we have estimated, our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially affected. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining loss accrual is billion, of which million is included in Other current liabilities with the remainder included in Other non-current liabilities. 
 Sentinel Program 
 In 2020, the U.S. Air Force awarded Northrop Grumman a billion contract for the EMD phase of the Sentinel program. In January 2024, the U.S. Air Force provided congressional notification that the Sentinel program was under a Nunn-McCurdy breach review, which is required when total program cost estimates exceed certain defined thresholds. This notification, which had been driven primarily by increases in cost estimates for the Production and Deployment phases, commenced the process to achieve recertification for continuance of the program and update its baseline cost estimates. We are currently executing under a cost-type contract for the EMD phase, and the Production and Deployment phases are yet to be priced and negotiated. 
 In July 2024, the Sentinel program was recertified for continuation by the DoD upon completion of the Nunn-McCurdy breach review. In connection with the recertification, the DoD directed that the program be restructured, including plans for infrastructure related to the command and launch segment, which was the main driver of the increased cost estimates for the Production and Deployment phases. We are partnering with our customer to establish a new program baseline as part of the restructuring activities. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we reviewed our estimated profitability on the Sentinel program and made no significant changes. The Sentinel EAC incorporates our best estimate of costs to complete the restructured EMD effort; however, if the outcome is more or less favorable than what we have estimated, our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially affected. 
 Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) Program In 2021, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) awarded Northrop Grumman Phase 5 of the HALO program to complete the design and development of HALO for NASA s Gateway program. At the request of NASA, Space Systems submitted an engineering change proposal (ECP) during the fourth quarter of 2023 for scope increases and other aspects of the HALO contract largely stemming from evolving Lunar Gateway architecture and mission requirements. During the third quarter of 2024, the company completed its negotiations with NASA and resolved the ECP .

 EAC adjustments on a single performance obligation can have a significant effect on the company s financial statements. When such adjustments occur, we generally disclose the nature, underlying conditions and financial impact of the adjustments. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a million favorable EAC adjustment on the HALO program at Space Systems related to the ECP resolution noted above. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded a million unfavorable EAC adjustment on the HALO program.

 Effective income tax rate 
 Current Quarter 
 The company s third quarter 2024 effective tax rate (ETR) decreased to percent from percent in the prior year period principally driven by a net reduction in tax reserves largely due to a recent federal court decision, partially offset by higher interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits. The third quarter 2024 ETR includes benefits of million for research credits, partially offset by million of interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits and million in tax expense related to foreign-derived intangible income (FDII). The third quarter 2023 ETR included benefits of million for research credits and million for FDII, partially offset by million of interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits. 
 Year to Date 
 The company s year to date 2024 ETR decreased to percent from percent in the prior year period principally driven by a net reduction in tax reserves largely due to a recent federal court decision, partially offset by higher interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits. The year to date 2024 ETR includes benefits of million for research credits, partially offset by million of interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits and million in tax expense related to FDII. The year to date 2023 ETR included benefits of million for research credits and million for FDII, partially offset by million of interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits. 
 Taxes receivable, which are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial position, were million as of September 30, 2024 and billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 The company has recorded unrecognized tax benefits related to our methods of accounting associated with the timing of revenue recognition and related costs and the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes related final revenue recognition regulations issued in December 2020 under IRC Section 451(b) and procedural guidance issued in August 2021. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately billion in unrecognized tax benefits, including million related to our position on IRC Section 451(b). If these matters, including our position on IRC Section 451(b), are unfavorably resolved, there could be a material impact on our future cash flows. It is also reasonably possible that within the next 12 months our unrecognized tax benefits related to these matters may decrease by approximately million, reflecting our best estimate of the most likely outcome of ongoing IRS negotiations. 
 Our current unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in Other current liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial position, were billion and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with the remainder of our unrecognized tax benefits included within Other non-current liabilities. 
 We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Northrop Grumman 2018-2020 federal tax returns are currently under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination. During the second quarter of 2023, the company entered into an agreed Revenue Agent s Report RAR for certain matters related to the company s 2014-2017 federal income tax returns, resulting in a million reduction to our unrecognized tax benefits and an immaterial impact to income tax expense. The matters not addressed by the agreed RAR related to the company s 2014-2017 federal income tax returns and refund claims related to its 2007-2016 federal tax returns are currently under review by the IRS Appeals Office. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Pillar Two model rules for a new global minimum tax of 15 effective January 1, 2024. While it is uncertain whether the United States will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, certain countries in which we operate have adopted legislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing legislation to implement Pillar Two. Pillar Two had no impact on our third quarter or year to date 2024 effective tax rate, and we do not currently expect Pillar Two to significantly impact our effective tax rate going forward.

 The company believes it has adequately reserved for disputed amounts that are probable and reasonably estimable, and that the outcome of any such matters would not have a material adverse effect on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024, or its annual results of operations and/or cash flows. 
 In 2019, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) raised questions about an interest rate assumption used by the company to determine our CAS pension expense. On June 1, 2020, DCMA provided written notice that the assumptions the company used during the period 2013-2019 were potentially noncompliant with CAS. We submitted a formal response on July 31, 2020, which we believed demonstrates the appropriateness of the assumptions used. On November 24, 2020, DCMA replied to the company s response, disagreeing with our position and requesting additional input, which we provided on February 22, 2021. We subsequently continued to exchange correspondence and engage with DCMA on this matter, including responding to requests for and providing additional information. On February 15, 2024, DCMA sent to the company a Contracting Officer s determination of noncompliance with CAS, which is an interim, non-final determination, and the parties engaged in discussions. As noted in Note 6 above, the company received from the DOJ a criminal subpoena on December 9, 2022 and a CID on

 (1) As of September 30, 2024, million is recorded in Other current liabilities and million is recorded in Other non-current liabilities. 
 (2) Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value. The reasonably possible future costs in excess of accrued costs do not take into consideration amounts expected to be recoverable through overhead charges on U.S. government contracts. 
 (3) As of September 30, 2024, million is deferred in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and million is deferred in Other non-current assets. These amounts reflect a million increase during the second quarter of 2024 in our estimated recovery of certain environmental remediation costs and are evaluated for recoverability on a routine basis. 
 Although management cannot predict whether (i) new information gained as our environmental remediation projects progress, (ii) changes in remediation standards or other requirements to which we are subject, or (iii) other changes in facts and circumstances will materially affect the estimated liability accrued, we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures associated with our currently identified projects will have a material adverse effect on the company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024, or its annual results of operations and/or cash flows. 
 Financial Arrangements 
 In the ordinary course of business, the company uses standby letters of credit and guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued principally by insurance companies to guarantee the performance on certain obligations. At September 30, 2024, there were million of stand-by letters of credit and guarantees and million of surety bonds outstanding. 
 Commercial Paper 
 The company maintains a commercial paper program that serves as a source of short-term financing with capacity to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to billion. At September 30, 2024, there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
 Credit Facilities 
 The company maintains a five-year senior unsecured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of billion (the 2022 Credit Agreement that matures in August 2027 and is intended to support the company's commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes. Commercial paper borrowings reduce the amount available for borrowing under the 2022 Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2024, there were borrowings outstanding under this facility.

 FAS/CAS Operating Adjustment 
 For financial statement purposes, we account for our employee pension plans in accordance with FAS. However, the cost of these plans is charged to our contracts in accordance with applicable Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and CAS requirements. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment reflects the difference between CAS pension expense included as cost in segment operating income and the service cost component of FAS expense included in total operating income. 
 Unallocated Corporate Expense 
 Unallocated corporate expense includes the portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable under the applicable FAR and CAS requirements, and therefore not allocated to the segments, such as changes in deferred state income taxes and a portion of management and administration, legal, environmental, compensation, retiree benefits, advertising and other corporate unallowable costs. Unallocated corporate expense also includes costs not considered part of management s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets and the additional depreciation expense related to the step-up in fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired through business combinations, as well as certain compensation and other costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
 Northrop Grumman Corporation 
 Falls Church, Virginia 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2024, and the related condensed consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income and changes in shareholders equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the interim financial information ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated January 24, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the audited consolidated statement of financial position from which it has been derived. 
 Basis for Review Results 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Northrop Grumman Corporation (herein referred to as Northrop Grumman, the company, we, us, or our is a leading global aerospace and defense technology company. We deliver a broad range of products, services and solutions to United States (U.S.) and international customers, and principally to the U.S Department of Defense (DoD) and intelligence community. Our broad portfolio is aligned to support national security priorities and our solutions equip our customers with capabilities they need to connect, protect and advance humanity. 
 The company is a leading provider of space systems, advanced aircraft, missile defense, advanced weapons and long-range fires capabilities, mission systems, networking and communications, strategic deterrence systems, and breakthrough technologies, such as artificial intelligence, advanced computing and cyber. We are focused on competing and winning programs that enable continued growth, performing on our commitments and affordably delivering capability our customers need. With the investments we've made in advanced technologies, combined with our talented workforce and digital transformation capabilities, Northrop Grumman is well positioned to meet our customers' needs today and in the future. 
 The following discussion should be read along with the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q, as well as Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks and Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which provides additional information on our business, the environment in which we operate and our operating results. 
 Global Security Environment 
 The U.S. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors, including in particular major global powers, as well as terrorist organizations, increasing nuclear tensions, diverse regional security concerns and political instability. The market for defense products, services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges, considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic circumstances and priorities. Our operations and financial performance, as well as demand for our products and services, are impacted by these events, including global unrest. The same is true for our suppliers and other business partners. 
 The ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the escalating hostilities in the Middle East and threats elsewhere, particularly in the Pacific region, have increased global tensions and instability and highlighted security requirements globally, including in Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific region, as well as the U.S. These conflicts have resulted in and may continue to result in increased demand for defense products and services from allies and partner nations, particularly in those areas. For example, we have experienced, and, while difficult to predict, may continue to experience, an increase in demand for certain of our products and services directly and indirectly related to the conflict in Ukraine. Sales may occur directly or through the U.S. if it provides increased military assistance and support to Ukraine. We have not experienced, and do not anticipate experiencing, significant adverse financial impacts directly from the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine or the Middle East. 
 We believe the current global security environment highlights the significant national security threats to the U.S. and its allies, and the need for strong deterrence and robust defense capabilities, and are actively evaluating both opportunities and risks associated with this environment. We believe our capabilities, particularly in space, C4ISR, missile defense, battle management, advanced weapons, strategic deterrence, and survivable aircraft and mission systems should help our customers in the U.S. and globally defend against current and future threats and, as a result, continue to allow for long-term profitable business growth. 
 Global Economic Environment 
 Over the past several years, the global economic environment has experienced extraordinary challenges, including inflationary pressures; widespread delays and disruptions in supply chains; business slowdowns or shutdowns; workforce challenges and labor shortfalls; and market volatility. These macroeconomic factors have contributed, and we expect will continue to contribute, to increased costs, delays, disruptions and other performance challenges, as well as increased competing demands for limited resources to address such increased costs and other challenges, for our company, our suppliers and partners, and our customers. We continue to work hard to mitigate challenges caused by the macroeconomic environment on our business. We are seeing positive progress in the supply chain as on-time deliveries and quality have improved. In remaining areas of pressure, we are proactively working with our suppliers to ensure we meet our contract commitments. Although certain pockets of our business were adversely affected by the broader macroeconomic environment during the third quarter of 2024, the overall financial impact on our company has continued to subside.

 NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION 

 In addition, although the federal funds interest rate decreased in the third quarter of 2024, an overall increase in interest rates in recent years has raised the cost of borrowing for governments, and if rates were to increase again, it could further impact government spending priorities (in the U.S. and allied countries, in particular), including their demand for defense products. Economic tensions and changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements, could also further impact the global market for defense products, services and solutions. 
 U.S. Political, Budget and Regulatory Environment 
 The U.S. continues to face an uncertain and evolving political, budget and regulatory environment. In particular, it is difficult to predict the specific course of future defense budgets. Current and future requirements related to the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, threats in the Pacific regions and other security priorities, as well as global inflation, the national debt, and other domestic priorities, among other things, in the U.S. and globally, will continue to impact our customers budgets, spending and priorities, and our industry. The U.S. political environment, including the U.S. election cycle, may also impact defense budgets and priorities, issues related to the national debt, and government spending more broadly. We anticipate that issues related to budgetary priorities and defense spending levels, the debt ceiling, and the spending caps imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA), particularly with respect to discretionary spending, will continue to be a subject of considerable debate, with a potentially significant impact on our programs and the company. 
 On March 11, 2024, the Administration released its budget request for FY 2025. The request included 895 billion for national security, 850 billion of which is for the DoD. FY 2025 appropriations have not been enacted and, on September 26, 2024, the President signed into law a continuing resolution (CR) to carry forward FY 2024 funding levels into FY 2025 while negotiations continue regarding full-year appropriations. The CR runs through December 20, 2024. It remains uncertain when the government will approve final FY 2025 appropriations, and the levels of funding that FY 2025 appropriations will provide. Government operations under an extended CR could have potential impacts on our programs and new starts, in particular. 
 On March 23, 2024, the President signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 2024, which provided funding for government agencies, including 825 billion for the DoD, through September 30, 2024. On April 24, 2024, the President signed into law bills providing 95 billion in supplemental funding for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific, which include 67 billion in DoD funding for the restock of U.S. munitions and additional capacity. 
 The political environment, federal budget, debt ceiling and regulatory environment, including potential tax reform, are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, especially in light of the ongoing conflicts and heightened global tensions, the macroeconomic environment and political tensions. The results of those debates could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and the company s programs in particular.

 Sales 
 Current Quarter 
 Third quarter 2024 sales increased 221 million, or 2 percent, due to higher sales at Mission Systems, Aeronautics Systems and Defense Systems, partially offset by lower sales at Space Systems largely driven by a reduction of 224 million associated with wind-down of our work on the restricted space and NGI programs, as previously disclosed. Third quarter 2024 sales reflect continued strong demand for our products and services. 
 Year to Date 
 Year to date 2024 sales increased 1.7 billion, or 6 percent, due to higher sales at all four sectors, including 12 percent growth at Aeronautics Systems. 
 See Segment Operating Results below for further information by segment and Product and Service Analysis for product and service detail. See Note 10 to the financial statements for information regarding the company s sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments. 
 Operating Income and Margin Rate 
 Current Quarter 
 Third quarter 2024 operating income increased 104 million, or 10 percent, primarily due to 57 million of higher segment operating income and a 40 million increase in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. Operating margin rate increased to 11.2 percent from 10.4 percent primarily due to benefits associated with the FAS/CAS operating adjustment and a higher segment operating margin rate. 
 Third quarter 2024 general and administrative (G A) costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 9.9 percent from 10.5 percent in the prior year period primarily due to cost management and higher sales. 
 Year to Date 
 Year to date 2024 operating income increased 351 million, or 12 percent, due to 208 million of higher segment operating income, a 94 million increase in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment and 49 million of lower unallocated corporate expense. Operating margin rate increased to 10.8 percent from 10.2 percent primarily due to benefits associated with the FAS/CAS operating adjustment and lower unallocated corporate expense.

 Net Earnings 
 Current Quarter 
 Third quarter 2024 net earnings increased 89 million, or 9 percent, primarily due to 104 million of higher operating income, a 36 million increase in the non-operating FAS pension benefit and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by a 97 million gain recognized in the prior year upon the sale of a minority investment. 
 Year to Date 
 Year to date 2024 net earnings increased 319 million, or 12 percent, primarily due to 351 million of higher operating income and a 106 million increase in the non-operating FAS pension benefit, partially offset by a 97 million gain recognized in the prior year upon the sale of a minority investment and 44 million of higher interest expense. 
 Diluted Earnings Per Share 
 Current Quarter 
 Third quarter 2024 diluted earnings per share increased 13 percent, reflecting a 9 percent increase in net earnings and a 3 percent reduction in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. 
 Year to Date 
 Year to date 2024 diluted earnings per share increased 16 percent, reflecting a 12 percent increase in net earnings and a 3 percent reduction in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. 
 
 SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The company is aligned in four operating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems. 
 Effective July 1, 2024, the company realigned the Strategic Deterrent Systems (SDS) division, which includes the Sentinel program, from Space Systems to Defense Systems. This realignment is reflected in the accompanying financial information. 
 Operating Performance Assessment and Reporting 
 This section discusses segment sales, operating income and operating margin rates. In evaluating segment operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income. Where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs, or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts, are described in our analysis. Based on this approach and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services. Changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, while changes in margin rates are generally described in terms of performance and/or contract mix. For purposes of this discussion, volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from production/service activity levels and performance generally refers to non-volume related changes in profitability. Contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type and/or lifecycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production, and/or sustainment). 
 We periodically record losses and restructure contract terms, conditions and pricing for certain programs. For additional information on the B-21, Sentinel and HALO programs, please see Note 1 to the financial statements.

 Segment Operating Income and Margin Rate 
 Segment operating income, as reconciled in the table below, and segment operating margin rate (segment operating income divided by sales) are non-GAAP measures that reflect the combined operating income of our four segments less the operating income associated with intersegment sales. Segment operating income includes pension expense allocated to our sectors under FAR and CAS and excludes FAS pension service expense and unallocated corporate items (certain corporate-level expenses, which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable FAR and CAS requirements, and costs not considered part of management s evaluation of segment operating performance). These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. These measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.

 Current Quarter 
 Third quarter 2024 segment operating income increased 57 million, or 5 percent, primarily due to a higher segment operating margin rate and higher sales. Segment operating margin rate increased to 11.5 percent and reflects higher operating margin rates at Space Systems and Aeronautics Systems, partially offset by lower operating margin rates at Mission Systems and Defense Systems. 
 Year to Date 
 Year to date 2024 segment operating income increased 208 million, or 7 percent, primarily due to higher sales. Segment operating margin rate was comparable to the prior year period and reflects a higher operating margin rate at Space Systems, partially offset by a lower operating margin rate at Mission Systems. 
 FAS/CAS Operating Adjustment 
 Third quarter 2024 and year to date 2024 FAS/CAS operating adjustment reflects higher CAS pension expense largely driven by plan asset returns in prior years and changes in certain CAS actuarial assumptions as of December 31, 2023. 
 Unallocated Corporate Expense 
 Current Quarter 
 The decrease in third quarter 2024 unallocated corporate expense is primarily due to lower intangible asset amortization and PP E step-up depreciation. 
 Year to Date 
 The decrease in year to date 2024 unallocated corporate expense is primarily due to lower intangible asset amortization and PP E step-up depreciation and a loss recognized in the prior year in connection with the divestiture of a small international subsidiary. 
 Net EAC Adjustments - We record changes in estimated contract earnings at completion (net EAC adjustments) using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. Net EAC adjustments can have a significant effect on segment operating income and margin rate.

 NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION 

 Year to Date 
 Year to date 2024 operating income decreased 18 million, or 2 percent, due to a lower operating margin rate, partially offset by higher sales. Operating margin rate decreased to 13.7 percent from 14.6 percent, primarily due to lower net EAC adjustments on certain airborne radar production programs due, in part, to production inefficiencies that have driven higher labor costs, as well as changes in contract mix toward more cost-type content. These decreases were partially offset by sales growth on higher margin advanced microelectronics programs.

 Sales 
 Current Quarter 
 Third quarter 2024 sales decreased 83 million, or 3 percent, primarily due to wind-down of our work on the restricted space and NGI programs, which reduced sales by 224 million. This reduction was partially offset by a 129 million increase on Space Development Agency (SDA) satellite programs and higher sales across our remaining restricted space portfolio. 
 Year to Date 
 Year to date 2024 sales increased 246 million, or 3 percent, primarily due to a 322 million increase on SDA satellite programs, a 123 million increase on HALO, and higher materials volume on the GEM 63 program in support of Amazon s Project Kuiper. These increases were partially offset by 365 million of lower sales associated with wind-down of our work on the restricted space and NGI programs. Lower sales associated with the wind-down of our work on the restricted space program were largely offset by higher sales across our remaining restricted space portfolio. 
 Operating Income 
 Current Quarter 
 Third quarter 2024 operating income increased 43 million, or 14 percent, due to a higher operating margin rate, which more than offset lower sales. Operating margin rate increased to 12.0 percent from 10.2 percent principally due to an improvement in net EAC adjustments, partially offset by a 16 million benefit in the prior year from insurance recoveries in our commercial space business. 
 Year to Date 
 Year to date 2024 operating income increased 139 million, or 17 percent, due to a higher operating margin rate and higher sales. Operating margin rate increased to 10.9 percent from 9.6 percent principally due to an improvement in net EAC adjustments, partially offset by a 16 million benefit in the prior year from insurance recoveries in our commercial space business.

 Product Sales and Costs 
 Current Quarter 
 Third quarter 2024 product sales increased 261 million, or 3 percent, primarily due to an increase in product sales at Mission Systems and Defense Systems, partially offset by a decrease in product sales at Space Systems. The increases were principally due to higher restricted sales at Mission Systems and higher volume on Sentinel, SiAW and certain military ammunition programs at Defense Systems. The Space Systems decrease was principally due to wind-down of our work on the restricted space and NGI programs, partially offset by higher volume on the SDA T2TL programs at Space Systems. 
 Third quarter 2024 product costs increased 151 million, or 2 percent, consistent with the higher product sales described above and reflect a higher operating margin rate principally due to higher net EAC adjustments on Space Systems product programs. 
 -28- 

Table of Contents 
 
 NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION 

 Year to Date 
 Year to date 2024 product sales increased 1.7 billion, or 8 percent, primarily due to an increase in product sales at all four sectors. The increase was principally driven by higher volume on restricted programs, F-35, E-2 and Triton at Aeronautics Systems, higher volume on SiAW, certain military ammunition programs and GMLRS at Defense Systems, sales growth on SDA T2TL, HALO and GEM 63 at Space Systems, and higher restricted sales, partially offset by lower SABR and F-35 volume, at Mission Systems. 
 Year to date 2024 product costs increased 1.5 billion, or 7 percent, consistent with the higher product sales described above and reflect a higher operating margin rate principally due to higher net EAC adjustments on Space Systems product programs. 
 Service Sales and Costs 
 Current Quarter 
 Third quarter 2024 service sales decreased 40 million, or 2 percent, primarily due to a decrease in service sales at Defense Systems principally due to the completion of an international training program and lower volume on SEMA, partially offset by an increase in service sales at Aeronautics Systems driven by higher volume on restricted programs. 
 Third quarter 2024 service costs increased 13 million, or 1 percent, reflecting a lower operating margin rate principally due to a 16 million prior year benefit for insurance recoveries at Space Systems, changes in contract mix at Defense Systems and lower net EAC adjustments on Mission Systems service programs. 
 Year to Date 
 Year to date 2024 service sales decreased 32 million, or 1 percent, primarily due to a decrease in service sales at Defense Systems principally due to the completion of an international training program and lower volume on SEMA, partially offset by an increase in service sales at Aeronautics Systems driven by higher volume on restricted programs and Global Hawk. 
 Year to date 2024 service costs were comparable with the prior year period reflecting a lower operating margin rate principally due to lower net EAC adjustments on Mission Systems service programs, as well as a 16 million prior year benefit for insurance recoveries at Space Systems. 
 
 BACKLOG 
 Backlog consisted of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 in millions Funded Unfunded Total Backlog Total Backlog Change in 2024

 Third quarter and year to date 2024 net awards totaled 11.7 billion and 33.3 billion, respectively, and backlog totaled 84.8 billion. Significant third quarter new awards include 2.7 billion for restricted programs (primarily at Mission Systems, Aeronautics Systems, and Space Systems), 1.6 billion for E-2 and 0.7 billion for certain military ammunition programs. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the company reduced unfunded backlog by 1.6 billion related to a termination for convenience in our restricted space business. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the company reduced unfunded backlog by 0.7 billion related to a termination for convenience on the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program at Space Systems. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We are focused on the efficient conversion of operating income into cash to provide for the company s material cash requirements, including working capital needs, satisfaction of contractual commitments, funding of our pension and OPB plans, investment in our business through capital expenditures, and shareholder return through dividend payments and share repurchases. 
 -29- 

Table of Contents 
 
 NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION 

 At September 30, 2024, we had 3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We expect cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities, commercial paper and/or in the capital markets through our shelf registration with the SEC, if needed, to be sufficient to provide liquidity to the company in the short-term and long-term. The company has a five-year senior unsecured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 2.5 billion, and in April 2024, we renewed our one-year 500 million uncommitted credit facility. At September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. In January 2024, we issued 2.5 billion of unsecured senior notes for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment, share repurchases and working capital. 
 IRC Section 174 
 Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 TCJA eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current year and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years pursuant to IRC Section 174. Our 2023 cash from operations were reduced by approximately 500 million for federal estimated tax payments we made related to Section 174. In the future, Congress may consider legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years, possibly with retroactive effect. In the meantime, we expect to continue to make additional federal tax payments based on the current Section 174 tax law, which we estimate will reduce our 2024 cash from operations by approximately 350 million. The impact of Section 174 on our cash from operations depends on the amount of research and development expenditures incurred by the company and whether the IRS issues guidance on the provision which differs from our current interpretation, among other things. 
 Cash Flow Measures 
 In addition to our cash position, we consider various cash flow measures in capital deployment decision-making, including cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure described in more detail below. 
 Operating Cash Flow 
 The table below summarizes key components of cash provided by operating activities: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30 in millions 2024 2023 Change Net earnings 2,910 2,591 12 Non-cash items (1) 
 302 474 (36) Pension and OPB contributions (93) (108) (14) Changes in trade working capital (1,346) (1,469) (8) Other, net 37 (43) NM Net cash provided by operating activities 1,810 1,445 25 
 (1) Includes depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and net periodic pension and OPB income. 
 Year to date 2024 net cash provided by operating activities increased 365 million as compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher net earnings and improved trade working capital, largely driven by lower net federal tax payments, partially offset by the timing of billings and cash collections. 
 Free Cash Flow 
 Free cash flow, as reconciled in the table below, is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by or used in operating activities less capital expenditures, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We use free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, the payment of dividends and stock repurchases. This non-GAAP measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

 The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30 in millions 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 1,810 1,445 25 Capital expenditures (951) (972) (2) Free cash flow 859 473 82 
 Year to date 2024 free cash flow increased 386 million, or 82 percent, as compared with the same period in 2023 principally due to higher net cash provided by operating activities. 
 Investing Cash Flow 
 Year to date 2024 net cash used in investing activities increased 139 million, or 17 percent, as compared with the same period in 2023 principally due to 157 million of proceeds received in the prior year from the sale of a minority investment, partially offset by lower capital expenditures largely driven by timing. 
 Financing Cash Flow 
 Year to date 2024 net cash used in financing activities decreased 486 million, or 43 percent, as compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to 1.05 billion of fewer debt repayments and a 500 million increase in proceeds from long-term debt, partially offset by a 919 million increase in share repurchases and a 53 million increase in dividends paid.
