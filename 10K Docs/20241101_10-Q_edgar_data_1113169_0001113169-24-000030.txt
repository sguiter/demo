 The investment partnerships held at fair value are valued using net asset value NAV per share as a practical expedient. Our interests in these partnerships are generally not redeemable and are subject to significant transferability restrictions. The underlying investments of these partnerships have contractual terms through 2029, though we may receive distributions of liquidating assets over a longer term. The investment strategies of these partnerships include growth equity, buyout, venture capital, and real estate. 
 
 During the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, net gains on investments included million and million, respectively, of net unrealized gains related to investments carried at fair value that were still held at September 30, 2024. For the same periods of 2023, net gains on investments included million of net unrealized losses and and million of net unrealized gains, respectively, related to investments carried at fair value that were still held at September 30, 2023. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, certain sponsored investment products in which we provided initial seed capital at the time of formation were deconsolidated, as we no longer had a controlling interest. Depending on our ownership interest, we report our residual interests in these sponsored investment products as either an equity method investment or an investment held at fair value.

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATED COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS. 
 
 There is debt associated with our long-term investments in affiliated collateralized loan obligations CLOs ). This debt is carried at million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023, and is reported in accounts payable and accrued expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The debt includes outstanding repurchase agreements of million (equivalent to million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023 at the respective EUR spot rates) that are collateralized by the CLO investments. The debt also includes outstanding note facilities of million (equivalent to million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023, at the respective EUR spot rates) that are collateralized by first priority security interests in the assets of a consolidated subsidiary that is party to the notes. These note facilities bear interest at rates based on EURIBOR plus the initial margin, which equals all-in rates ranging from to as of September 30, 2024. The debt matures on various dates through 2035 or if the investments are paid back in full or cancelled, whichever is sooner. 
 
 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. 
 
 Unfunded capital commitments Accounts receivable 
 
 The unfunded capital commitments, totaling million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023, relate primarily to the affiliated private investment funds and the investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment. In addition to such amounts, a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances. 
 
 Certain of the investments in affiliated funds represent interests in the general partners of affiliated private investment funds that are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of income or carried interest. The entities holding such interests are considered variable interest entities and are consolidated as we were determined to be the primary beneficiary.

 The fair value hierarchy level table above does not include the investment partnerships and other investments for which fair value is estimated using their NAV per share as a practical expedient. The carrying value of these investments as disclosed in Note 3 were million at September 30, 2024, and million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Level 3 investments fair value is derived from inputs that are unobservable and that reflect our own determinations about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the investments, including assumptions about risk. These inputs are developed based on our data, which is adjusted if information indicates that market participants would use different assumptions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in Level 3 fair values were solely attributable to the purchases of new investments and there were no transfers into or out of Level 3.

 Contingent Consideration 
 
 As part of the purchase consideration for our acquisition of OHA in December 2021, there is contingent 
 consideration in the amount of up to million, payable in cash, that may be due as part of an earnout payment starting in 2025 and ending in 2027 upon satisfying or exceeding certain defined revenue targets. These defined revenue targets will be evaluated on a cumulative basis beginning at the end of 2024, with the ability to extend two

This arrangement is treated as a post-combination compensation expense. This arrangement will be remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and recognized as part of compensation expense over the related service period.

 The operating expenses of the consolidated investment products are reflected in general, administrative and other expenses. In preparing our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we eliminated operating expenses of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, against the investment advisory and administrative fees earned from these products. Operating expenses eliminated for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were million and million, respectively. The net investment income (loss) reflected in non-operating income (loss) includes dividend and interest income as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying securities held by the consolidated sponsored investment products.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net cash provided by or used in financing activities includes million of net redemptions we made from the consolidated sponsored investment products and dividends received. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net cash provided by or used in financing activities included million of net subscriptions we made into the consolidated sponsored investment products, net of dividends received. These cash flows were eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. 
 
 We determine the fair value of investments held by consolidated sponsored investment products using the following broad levels of inputs as defined by related accounting standards: 
 
 Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. 
 Level 2 observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices including, but not limited to, quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, and credit risk. These inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources. 
 Level 3 unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions based on the best information available. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Investments in this category generally include investments for which there is not an actively-traded market. 
 
 These levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk or liquidity associated with these investment holdings.

 Impairment 
 
 Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired. Based on a review of qualitative factors, primarily the future outlook, we determined it was necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test on the trade name intangible asset during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. The quantitative impairment tests resulted in the carrying amount of the trade name intangible asset exceeding its fair value and we recognized impairment charges of million and million for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis where estimated future cash flows were discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. This approach included inputs that required significant management judgment, the most relevant of which include revenue growth, discount rate, and effective tax rate. 
 
 We evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or if triggering events occur that require us to evaluate for impairment earlier. No triggering events arose during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheet of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and subsidiaries ("the Company") as of September 30, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, and stockholders equity for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 16, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 Basis for Review Results 
 This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company s management.

 We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

OVERVIEW. 
 
 Our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in a broad range of investment solutions across equity, fixed income, multi-asset, and alternative capabilities. We also provide certain investment advisory clients with related administrative services, including distribution, mutual fund transfer agent, accounting, and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans; brokerage; trust services; and non-discretionary advisory services through model delivery. 
 
 Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations. 
 
 We incur significant expenditures to develop new products and services and improve and expand our capabilities and distribution channels in order to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients. These efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from an increase to our assets under management. 
 
 The investment management industry has been evolving and industry participants are facing several challenging trends including passive investments taking market share from traditional active strategies; continued downward fee pressure; demand for new investment vehicles to meet client needs; and an ever-changing regulatory landscape. In this regard, we have ample liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities. We are investing in key capabilities, including investment professionals, distribution professionals, technologies, and new product offerings in order to provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service. 

MARKET TRENDS. 
 
 Major U.S. stock market indexes rose in the third quarter of 2024. Shares were supported by generally favorable corporate earnings and expectations that a softening labor market and easing inflation pressures would enable the Federal Reserve to begin reducing short-term interest rates. Volatility increased considerably at times, but the market finished the quarter on a positive note, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell declared in late August at the central bank s annual economic symposium that the time has come for policymakers to adjust short-term rates. On September 18, the central bank reduced the fed funds target rate by 50 basis points which was more than some investors expected and Fed officials noted the potential for additional adjustments as they carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. 
 
 Developed non-U.S. equity markets generally outperformed large-cap U.S. stocks in U.S. dollar terms, as a weaker dollar versus major non-U.S. currencies lifted overseas returns in dollar terms. In Europe, equity markets were mostly positive. Several markets produced double-digit gains, while UK shares climbed about 8 . Developed Asian markets were broadly positive. Hong Kong shares surged more than 24 , lifted in part by Chinese stimulus measures intended to bolster the Chinese economy. 
 
 Emerging equity markets outperformed stocks in developed non-U.S. markets in dollar terms. Emerging Asian markets were mostly positive; a few rose more than 20 . Chinese shares surged more than 23 , while the A shares market climbed more than 21 , thanks to brisk gains in September stemming from new Chinese economic stimulus measures. Markets in Latin America and in the emerging Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region were largely positive in dollar terms.

 (1) Returns exclude dividends 
 
 Global bond returns were broadly positive in the third quarter of 2024. In the U.S., Treasury bill yields and shorter-term bond yields declined as the Fed reduced the fed funds target rate to the 4.75 to 5.00 range and signaled the potential for more rate cuts. Longer-term U.S. Treasury yields fell to a lesser degree. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield declined from 4.36 to 3.81 during the quarter. 
 
 In the U.S. investment-grade universe, sector performance was broadly positive. Corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities fared best. Treasuries and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities also did well. Asset-backed securities underperformed, but still produced solid gains. Tax-free municipal bonds lagged the broad taxable bond market, as municipal bond yields generally did not fall as much as comparable Treasury yields. High yield corporate bonds performed mostly in line with the investment-grade market. 
 
 Bonds in developed non-U.S. markets produced positive returns in dollar terms. Bond prices rose and yields declined in many European countries, as central banks in the UK and the eurozone reduced short-term interest rates, and a weaker dollar versus various currencies lifted overseas returns in dollar terms. In Japan, the central bank unexpectedly increased its benchmark interest rate in late July, resulting in a significant strengthening of the yen versus the dollar. In the emerging markets fixed income universe, local currency bonds outperformed dollar-denominated bonds in U.S. dollar terms, as the dollar weakened versus many developing markets currencies.

 Results Overview - Quarter ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Net revenues consist of investment advisory revenues; administrative, distribution, and servicing fees; and capital allocation-based income. More than 90 of our net revenues are related to investment advisory fees. Total net revenues were 1,785.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, a 6.9 increase over 1,670.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an 11.5 increase in investment advisory fee revenue as higher overall markets increased average assets under management by 14.1 . This increase was partially offset by a 61.5 million decrease in capital allocation-based income (change in accrued carried interest) earned from investments in certain affiliated funds. 
 
 Investment advisory fees are generally earned based on the value and composition of our assets under management, which change based on fluctuations in financial markets and net cash flows. As our average assets under management increase or decrease in a given period, the level of our investment advisory fee revenue for that 
 
 Page 26 

same period generally fluctuates in a similar manner. Our annualized effective fee rates can be impacted by market or cash flow related shifts among asset classes and products, including those with tiered-fee structures, along with price changes we make in existing products. 
 
 Capital allocation-based income will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter to reflect the adjustment to accrued carried interest for the change in value of certain affiliated funds assuming the funds underlying investments were realized as of the end of the period. 
 
 Operating expenses on a U.S. GAAP basis were 1,172.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, a 7.6 increase over the comparable 2023 period. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were 1,099.0 million, a 3.6 increase over the comparable 2023 period. 
 
 In comparison to the third quarter of 2023, about 70 of the increase in U.S. GAAP operating expenses was due to a market-related increase of 43.4 million in the supplemental savings liability in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a decrease of 14.2 million in the supplemental savings liability in the 2023 period. 
 
 Also contributing to the increase in U.S. GAAP operating expenses and the primary drivers of the increase in non-GAAP operating expenses were higher general, administrative and other costs due to a 20 million cost recovery recognized in Q3 2023 that didn't recur in Q3 2024, higher distribution and servicing costs on higher average assets under management distributed through intermediaries, and higher compensation and related benefits. These increases were partially offset by lower accrued carried interest-related compensation. 
 
 Operating margin in the third quarter of 2024 was 34.4 on a U.S. GAAP basis, compared to 34.8 earned in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in our U.S. GAAP operating margin for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the 2023 period was driven by operating expense growth outpacing net revenue growth primarily due to changes in the supplemental savings plan liability and lower capital allocation-based income. 
 
 Diluted earnings per share was 2.64 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.97 for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income, higher net investment gains, and a lower effective tax rate compared to the 2023 period. 
 
 On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share was 2.57 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2.17 for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted operating income, higher adjusted net investment gains, and a lower effective tax rate compared to the 2023 period. 
 
 Results Overview - Year-to-Date ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Net revenues consist of investment advisory revenues; administrative, distribution, and servicing fees; and capital allocation-based income. More than 90 of our net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are related to investment advisory fees. Total net revenues were 5,269.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 9.4 increase over 4,818.5 million in the 2023 period. The increase was primarily driven by a 11.3 increase in investment advisory fee revenue as average assets under management increased by 13.1 , partially offset by a 69.9 million decrease in capital allocation-based income (change in accrued carried interest) earned from investments in certain affiliated funds. 
 
 Operating expenses were 3,504.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 3,219.5 million in the 2023 period. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.3 to 3,276.2 million compared to the 2023 period. 
 
 In comparison to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, about 40 of the increase in U.S. GAAP operating expenses was driven by the change in remeasurement of the contingent consideration liability, as the 2023 period reflected a 72.8 million reduction in the liability compared to a 13.4M reduction in the 2024 period. Additionally, a market-related increase in the supplemental savings plan liability, and higher amortization and impairments related to acquisition-related intangibles, were also primary contributors to the increase in U.S. GAAP operating expenses. 
 
 Also contributing to the increase in U.S. GAAP operating expenses and the primary drivers of the increase in non-GAAP operating expenses were higher compensation and related benefits, including the interim bonus accrual, salaries and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, and general, administrative and other costs. 
 
 Page 27 

Operating margin in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 33.5 on a U.S. GAAP basis, compared to 33.2 earned in the 2023 period. The increase in our U.S. GAAP operating margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period was primarily driven by net revenue growth outpacing operating expense growth. 
 
 Diluted earnings per share was 7.23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.86 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 23.4 increase was driven by higher net investment gains, higher operating income, and a lower effective tax rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the comparable 2023 period. 
 
 On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share was 7.21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5.88 for the 2023 period. The 22.6 increase was primarily due to higher adjusted operating income and a lower effective tax rate.

Investment advisory fees in the third quarter of 2024 increased 11.5 over the comparable 2023 quarter as average assets under management increased 195.9 billion or 14.1 , to 1,589.5 billion. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investment advisory revenues increased 11.3 over the comparable 2023 period as average assets under management increased 178.0 billion, or 13.1 , to 1,536.2 billion. Investment advisory fees includes performance fees of 5.6 million and 40.0 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 2.1 million and 13.0 million in the same respective 2023 periods. Performance fees earned in 2024 and 2023 were primarily from equity and alternative products. 
 
 The average annualized effective fee rate earned for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 declined from the comparable 2023 periods due to client flows and transfers creating a mix shift in assets under management toward lower fee products and asset classes. The 2024 year-to-date annualized effective fee rate was favorably impacted by higher performance based fees of about 0.2 basis points. 
 
 Capital allocation-based income includes the change in accrued carried interest along with acquisition-related amortization and impairments. In the third quarter of 2024, the change in accrued carried interest increased net revenues by 35.1 million compared to 91.9 million in the 2023 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in accrued carried interest increased net revenues by 51.8 million compared to 121.7 million for the 2023 period. The decrease in the change in accrued carried interest for both periods was due to lower relative performance. We also recognized higher acquisition-related amortization and impairment changes in the 2024 periods. 
 
 A portion of the capital allocation-based income was passed through to certain associates as compensation and the related expense was recognized in compensation and related costs with the unpaid amount reported as non-controlling interest on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 Administrative, distribution, and servicing fees in the third quarter of 2024 were 148.1 million, an increase of 7.4 million, or 5.3 , from the comparable 2023 quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these fees were 444.8 million, an increase of 34.5 million, or 8.4 , from the 2023 period. The increases for both periods were primarily due to higher average assets on which we earn administrative revenue for non-discretionary advisory services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, higher retail transfer agent servicing activities provided to the T. Rowe Price mutual funds also contributed to the increase. 
 
 Our net revenues reflect the elimination of advisory and administrative fee revenue earned from our consolidated 
 sponsored investment products. The corresponding expenses recognized by these products, and consolidated in our financial statements, were also eliminated from operating expenses. For the third quarter, we eliminated net revenue of 1.3 million in 2024 and 0.7 million in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, we eliminated net revenue of 3.0 million in 2024 and 1.6 million in 2023.

 Compensation, benefits, and related costs were 632.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 15.9 million, or 2.6 , compared to the 2023 quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these costs were 1,898.0 million, an increase of 96.7 million, or 5.4 , compared to the 2023 period. The increases in both periods were primarily due to a higher interim bonus accrual, and higher salaries and related benefits, as base salary modestly increased in January 2024 and we increased our headcount. These increases were partially offset by higher labor capitalization and lower stock-based compensation compared to the 2023 periods. The 2023 periods included severance costs related to the July 2023 workforce action. 
 
 The firm employed 8,104 associates at September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.5 from the end of 2023 and an increase of 3.3 from September 30, 2023. 
 
 Distribution and servicing costs were 91.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 16.7 million, or 22.3 , from 74.9 million recognized in the 2023 quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these costs were 261.2 million, an increase of 21.9 , from 214.2 million recognized in the comparable 2023 period. The increases in both periods were primarily driven by higher average assets under management distributed through intermediaries. 
 
 The costs in this expense category primarily include amounts paid to third-party intermediaries that source the assets of certain share classes of our U.S. mutual funds, ETFs and our international products, such as our Japanese ITMs and SICAVs. These costs were offset entirely by the distribution revenue we earn and report in net revenues: 12b-1 revenue is recognized in administrative, distribution, and servicing fees for the Advisor and R share classes of the U.S. mutual funds and investment advisory fee revenue for our international products and ETFs. 
 
 Advertising and promotion costs were 20.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 0.3 million, or 1.4 , compared to the 21.1 million recognized in the 2023 quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these costs were 79.4 million, an increase of 9.6 million, or 13.8 , compared to the 2023 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase was primarily driven by higher media spend and increased investment in our brand. 

Page 30 

Technology, occupancy, and facility costs were 164.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 4.3 million, or 2.7 , compared to the 159.7 million recognized in the 2023 quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these costs were 474.8 million, an increase of 13.8 million, or 3.0 , compared with the 2023 period. The increases in both periods were primarily related to higher costs from the firm's ongoing investment in its technology capabilities, primarily hosted solution licenses. Specific to the nine months ended comparison, these increases were offset by lower office facility costs, as the 2023 period included the rent cost of two UK facilities until we occupied our new building in the second half of 2023, and the first quarter of 2024 included a non-recurring cost benefit related to the UK facility. 
 
 General, administrative, and other expenses were 104.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 18.5 million, or 21.6 , compared to the 85.7 million recognized in the 2023 quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these costs were 305.5 million, an increase of 12.3 million, or 4.2 , compared with the 2023 period. The increases in both periods were primarily due to a cost recovery recognized in 2023 that didn't recur in 2024, higher professional fees, and higher travel and entertainment. These increases were partially offset by lower research fee expense as the firm changed its approach to paying for research, consistent with regulations and general industry practice. 
 
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration represents the earnout arrangement related to our acquisition of OHA in which additional purchase price may be due upon satisfying or exceeding certain defined revenue targets. Every reporting period, we record the potential amount due under this arrangement at fair value. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 13.4 million reduction in the liability in 2024 compared to no change in the 2023 period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized reductions of the contingent consideration liability of 13.4 million and 72.8 million, respectively. Challenging market conditions have reduced revenue expectations below the defined revenue targets resulting in a reduction of the contingent consideration liability to zero as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Acquisition-related amortization and impairment costs. As part of the purchase accounting for our acquisitions, we identified and separately recognized, at fair value, certain intangible assets. During the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 51.5 million and 125.3 million, respectively, in amortization and impairments related to the definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets. These amounts include impairment charges of 25.6 million and 59.7 million, respectively, recognized on certain definite and indefinite-lived intangibles as reduced growth expectations reduced their fair value. For the comparable 2023 periods, amortization and impairment costs were of 38.5 million and 93.1 million, respectively. Should conditions that led us to recognize the impairment charges deteriorate further, additional impairments may be recognized in future periods.

Non-operating income (loss) 
 
 Non-operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was 212.5 million compared to 2.8 million in the 2023 quarter. The following table details the components of non-operating income for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Higher investment gains earned by our investment portfolio during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 periods were primarily due to overall stronger market returns and higher dividend income over both periods. 
 
 The table above includes the net investment income of the underlying portfolios included in the consolidated 
 sponsored investment products and not just the net investment income related to our ownership interest in the products. The table below shows the impact that the consolidated sponsored investment products had on the individual lines of our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and the portion attributable to our interest:

Provision for income taxes 
 
 The GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 22.5 compared with 24.8 in the third quarter of 2023. These quarterly rates were the result of an overall year-to-date rate of 23.5 for 2024 and 26.1 for 2023. The following table reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate on a U.S. GAAP basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Nine months ended 9/30/2024 9/30/2023 Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate 21.0 21.0 State income taxes for current year, net of federal income tax benefits (1) 
 2.7 3.0 Net (income) losses attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests (2) 
 (0.6) (0.2) Net excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation plans activity (0.2) (0.3) Valuation allowance 0.3 2.7 Other items 0.3 (0.1) Effective income tax rate 23.5 26.1 
 (1) State income tax benefits are reflected in the total benefits for net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and stock-based compensation plans activity. 
 (2) Net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests represents the portion of earnings held in the firm's consolidated investment products, which are not taxable to the firm despite being included in pre-tax income. 
 
 The non-GAAP effective tax rate primarily adjusts for the impact of the consolidated investment products, including the net income attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interests. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.8 in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 24.8 in the third quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 26.8 for the 2023 period. The year-to-date 2024 U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates decreased compared to 2023 rates primarily due to lower valuation allowances recognized. In the first nine months of 2023, we recognized a full valuation allowance against all UK-based deferred tax assets recorded at the time. 
 
 We currently estimate that our effective tax rate for the full year 2024, on a U.S. GAAP basis, will be in the range of 23.5 to 26.5 . On a non-GAAP basis, the range is 23.5 to 25.5 . 
 
 Our effective tax rate will continue to experience volatility in future periods as the tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation are impacted by market fluctuations in our stock price and the timing of option exercises. The rate also experiences volatility from the remeasurement of the contingent consideration liability, as well as changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances, primarily in foreign jurisdictions, based on the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods. Our U.S. GAAP rate will also be impacted by changes in the proportion of net income that is attributable to our redeemable non-controlling interests and non-controlling interests reflected in permanent equity. 

NON-GAAP INFORMATION AND RECONCILIATION. 
 
 We believe the non-GAAP financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating our core business, for comparing current results with prior period results, and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers. However, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies.

 (1) These non-GAAP adjustments remove the impact of acquisition-related amortization and costs including intangible assets and acquired assets amortization and impairments, contingent consideration liability fair value remeasurements, amortization and impairments of acquired investments and non-controlling interest basis differences, and amortization of compensation-related arrangements. Management believes adjusting for these charges helps the reader's ability to understand our core operating results and to increase comparability period to period. 
 
 (2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the compensation expense impact from market valuation changes in the supplemental savings plan liability and the related net gains (losses) on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability. Amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation (depreciation) of hypothetical investments chosen by participants. We use T. Rowe Price investment products to economically hedge the exposure to 
 
 Page 35 

these market movements. Management believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income (loss) realized on the economic hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help the reader's ability to understand our core operating results and to increase comparability period to period. 
 
 (3) These non-GAAP adjustments remove the impact that the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products have on our U.S. GAAP consolidated statements of income. Specifically, we add back the operating expenses and subtract the investment income of the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products. The adjustment to operating expenses represents the operating expenses of the consolidated products, net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees. The adjustment to net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. represents the net income of the consolidated products, net of redeemable non-controlling interests. Management believes the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products may impact the reader s ability to understand our core operating results. 
 
 (4) This non-GAAP adjustment represents the other non-operating income (loss) and the net gains (losses) earned on our investment portfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the supplemental savings plan liability, and that are not part of the cash and discretionary investment portfolio. We retain in our non-GAAP measures the investment gains recognized on the cash and discretionary investments as these assets and related income (loss) are considered part of our core operations. Management believes adjusting for these non-operating income (loss) items helps the reader s ability to understand our core operating results and increases comparability to prior years. Additionally, management does not emphasize the impact of the portion of non-operating income (loss) removed when managing and evaluating our performance. 
 
 (5) The income tax impacts were calculated in order to achieve an overall year-to-date non-GAAP effective tax rate of 24.1 in 2024 and 26.8 in 2023. As such, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 23.8 and 24.8 , respectively. 
 
 (6) This non-GAAP measure was calculated by applying the two-class method to adjusted net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution. The calculation of adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders is as follows: 
 
 Three months ended Nine months ended 9/30/2024 9/30/2023 9/30/2024 9/30/2023 Adjusted net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. 586.5 499.5 1,654.7 1,355.4 Less: adjusted net income allocated to outstanding restricted stock and stock unit holders 15.0 11.7 44.1 32.8 Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders 571.5 487.8 1,610.6 1,322.6 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 
 We have ample liquidity, including cash and investments in T. Rowe Price products, as follows: 
 (in millions) 9/30/2024 12/31/2023 Cash and cash equivalents 3,173.5 2,066.6 Discretionary investments 471.8 463.7 Total cash and discretionary investments 3,645.3 2,530.3 Redeemable seed capital investments 1,379.9 1,370.9 Investments used to hedge the supplemental savings plan liability 969.1 894.6 Total cash and investments in T. Rowe Price products 5,994.3 4,795.8 
 
 Our discretionary investment portfolio is comprised of short duration bond funds, which typically yield higher than money market rates. Our subsidiaries outside the United States held cash and discretionary investments of 771.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 699.0 million at December 31, 2023. Given the availability of our financial resources and cash expected to be generated through future operations, we do not maintain an available external source of additional liquidity. 

Page 36 

Our seed capital investments are redeemable, although we generally expect to be invested for several years for the products to build an investment performance history and until unrelated third-party investors substantially reduce our relative ownership percentage. 
 
 The cash and investment presentation on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet is based on the accounting treatment for the cash equivalent or investment item. The following table details how T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. s interests in cash and investments relate to where they are presented on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 
 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents Investments Net assets of consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products (1) 
 Total Cash and discretionary investments 3,173.5 321.9 149.9 3,645.3 Seed capital investments 493.8 886.1 1,379.9 Investments used to hedge the supplemental savings plan liability 969.1 969.1 Total cash and investments in T.

 3,173.5 2,966.0 1,799.4 7,938.9 
 (1) The consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products are generally those products we provided seed capital at the time of their formation and we have a controlling interest. These products generally represent U.S. mutual funds, ETFs, and funds regulated outside the U.S. The 1,036.0 million represents the total value at September 30, 2024 of our interest in the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products. The total net assets of the T. Rowe Price investment products at September 30, 2024 of 1,799.4 million includes assets of 1,857.2 million, less liabilities of 57.8 million as reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 (2) Includes 203.4 million of non-controlling interests in consolidated entities and represents the portion of these investments, held by related parties, that we cannot sell in order to obtain cash for general operations. 
 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet reflects the cash and cash equivalents, investments, other assets and liabilities of those sponsored investment products we consolidate, as well as redeemable non-controlling interests for the portion of these sponsored investment products that are held by unrelated third-party investors. Although we can redeem our net interest in these sponsored investment products at any time, we cannot directly access or sell the assets held by the products to obtain cash for general operations. Additionally, the assets of these sponsored investment products are not available to our general creditors. Our interest in these sponsored investment products was generally used as initial seed capital and is recategorized as discretionary when it is determined by management that the seed capital is no longer needed. We assess the discretionary investment products and, when we decide to liquidate our interest, we seek to do so in a way as to not impact the product and, ultimately, the unrelated third-party investors. 
 
 Uses of Liquidity 
 
 We increased our quarterly recurring dividend per common share in February 2024 by 1.6 to 1.24 per common share from 1.22 per common share. Further, we expended 263.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 to repurchase 2.3 million shares of our outstanding common stock, at an average price of 112.30 per share. These dividends and repurchases were expended using existing cash balances and cash generated from operations. While opportunistic in our approach to stock buybacks, we will generally repurchase our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equity-based compensation plans. 
 
 Since the end of 2021, we have returned nearly 4.5 billion to stockholders through stock repurchases and regular quarterly dividends, as follows: 

Page 37 

(in millions) Recurring dividend Stock repurchases Total cash returned to stockholders 2022 1,108.8 855.3 1,964.1 2023 1,121.9 254.3 1,376.2 Nine months ended 9/30/2024 
 850.7 263.7 1,114.4 Total 3,081.4 1,373.3 4,454.7 
 
 We anticipate property, equipment, software and other capital expenditures, including internal labor capitalization, for the full-year 2024 to be about 460 million of which approximately 60 is planned for technology initiatives with the remaining primarily related to the build out of our new Baltimore headquarters. We expect to fund our anticipated capital expenditures with operating cash flows and other available resources.

Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, that are attributable to T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., our consolidated sponsored investment products, and the related eliminations required in preparing the statement.

Operating Activities 
 Operating activities attributable to T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. during the first nine months of 2024 provided cash flows of 2,339.4 million, an increase of 222.1 million from 2,117.3 million provided during the 2023 period. The increase was primarily driven by a 309.1 million increase in net income and a 1.5 million increase in cash flows related to timing differences associated with the cash settlement of our assets and liabilities. These increases to operating cash flows were offset in part by a 17.0 million decrease in the add-back for non-cash items as detailed in the table above. Additionally, in 2024, proceeds received from net redemptions of investments that economically hedge our supplemental savings plan liability decreased 71.5 million as compared to the 2023 period. The remaining change in reported cash flows from operating activities was attributable to the net change in trading securities held in our consolidated investment products underlying portfolios. 
 
 Our interim operating cash flows does not include the cash impact of variable compensation that is accrued throughout the year before being substantially paid out in December. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities that were attributable to T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. totaled 143.1 million in 2024 compared with 333.3 million in 2023. During 2024, we had net proceeds from the sale of investments of 209.9 million compared to net purchases of investments totaling 72.1 million during the 2023 period. In 2024, we increased our property and equipment expenditures by 84.4 million and other investing activity by 7.4 million compared to the 2023 period. We eliminate our capital in those sponsored investment products we consolidate in preparing our consolidated statements of cash flows. The remaining change in reported cash flows from investing activities of 19.9 million is primarily related to the net cash removed from our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet from consolidating and deconsolidating investment products. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities attributable to T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. totaled 1,089.4 million in 2024 compared with 960.9 million in 2023. During 2024, we used 269.1 million to repurchase 2.3 million shares compared to 151.4 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares in 2023. The 9.0 million increase in dividends paid in 2024 was a result of the 1.6 increase in our quarterly dividend per share over prior year. In addition, cash flows generated from common stock issued under stock compensation plans increased by 2.6 million during 2024 compared to 2023. The remaining change in reported cash flows from financing activities was primarily attributable to a 17.5 million increase in net subscriptions from redeemable non-controlling interest holders of our consolidated investment products during 2024. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. 
 
 The preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. Further, significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, the revenues and expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time. Accordingly, actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and notes. 
 
 There have been no material changes in the critical accounting policies previously identified in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION. 
 
 From time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., including those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or anticipated information relating to: our revenues, net income, and earnings per share of common stock; changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management; our expense levels; our tax rate; legal or regulatory developments; geopolitical instability; interest rates and currency fluctuations; and our expectations regarding financial markets, future transactions, dividends, stock repurchases, investments, new products and services, capital expenditures, changes in our effective fee rate, and other industry or market conditions. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in Item 1A, Risk Factors, included in our Form 10-K Annual Report for 2023. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 
 
 Our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management. Such changes result from many factors, including, among other things: client-related cash inflows and outflows in our products, performance fees, capital allocation-based income, fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management, our introduction of new investment products, and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. 
 
 The ability to attract and retain investors assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the relative investment performance of the T. Rowe Price mutual funds and other managed investment products as compared with competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; the impact of changes in interest rates and inflation; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business; and our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the T. Rowe Price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the T. Rowe Price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. Non-operating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments, changes in their market valuations, and any other-than-temporary impairments that may arise or, in the case of our equity method investments, our proportionate share of the investees net income. 
 
 Our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the U.S. and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the U.S.; the pace and level of spending to support key strategic priorities; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, restricted stock units and other equity grants, other incentive awards, our supplemental savings plan, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; any goodwill, intangible asset or other asset impairment that may arise; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; the timing of the assumption of all third party research payments, unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties, such as fund and product recordkeeping, facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems, as a result of extreme events, cyberattacks or otherwise. 
 
 Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including, but not limited to, effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in sponsored investment products and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments.

(i) Form of Stock Option Grant. Each Stock Option granted under the Plan will be evidenced by an Award Agreement (which need not be the same for each recipient of a Stock Option Award) that is not inconsistent with the Plan, including any provisions that may be necessary to assure that any Stock Option that is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option will comply with section 422 of the 

6 Code. (ii) Exercise Period. Unless a shorter or longer period is otherwise provided in an Award Agreement and permitted by applicable law and subject to the provisions of Section 7(c)(vi) below, each Stock Option will expire and all rights to purchase shares of Common Stock thereunder will cease ten years after the Grant Date. (iii) Exercise Price and Terms. The exercise price per share subject to a Stock Option granted under the Plan shall not be less than 100 of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the Grant Date, except as provided under applicable law or with respect to Stock Options that are granted in substitution of similar types of awards of a company acquired by Price Group or an Affiliate or with which Price Group or an Affiliate combines (whether in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a merger, combination, consolidation or acquisition of property or stock, or otherwise) to preserve the intrinsic value of such awards, and during its term the Stock Option will be exercisable only on the event or events and under the terms determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. (iv) Limitations on Incentive Stock Options. The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the Grant Date of a Stock Option) of Common Stock that any Participant is first eligible to purchase during any calendar year by exercise of Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan and by exercise of Incentive Stock Options (within the meaning of section 422 of the Code) granted under any other plan of Price Group (and its parent and subsidiary corporations, within the meaning of section 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code, as may exist from time to time) may not exceed 100,000. If the Fair Market Value of stock with respect to which all Incentive Stock Options described in the preceding sentence held by any one Participant that are exercisable for the first time by that Participant during any calendar year exceeds 100,000, or any other applicable amount, the Stock Options that are intended to be Incentive Stock Options on the Grant Date thereof for the first 100,000 worth of shares of Common Stock to become exercisable in such year will be considered to constitute Incentive Stock Options within the meaning of section 422 of the Code and the Stock Options that are intended to be Incentive Stock Options on the Grant Date thereof for the shares of Common Stock in the amount in excess of 100,000 that become exercisable in that calendar year will be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options. For this purpose, the Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they are granted. Price Group may designate the shares of Common Stock that are to be treated as stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options and the shares of Common Stock that are to be treated as stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of Non-Qualified Stock Options by issuing separate certificates for the shares and identifying the certificates as such in the stock transfer records of Price Group or by any other appropriate notation in the records of Price Group.

(v) Dividend and Dividend Equivalents. No grant of a Stock Option may provide for dividends, dividend equivalents, or other similar distributions to be paid in connection with the exercise of the Stock Option. (vi) Tolling of Stock Option Exercise Period. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if, by its terms, a Stock Option, other than an Incentive Stock Option, would expire when trading in shares of Common Stock is otherwise prohibited by law or by the Company s insider trading policy, as such may be amended from time to time, the expiration of the Stock Option shall be tolled and the term of the Stock Option will be automatically extended until the close of trading on the 30th day following the expiration of any such prohibition. (vii) Vesting Period. The Administrator will determine the types of Stock Option Awards made and any terms and conditions applicable to the Awards as it considers appropriate, including any vesting conditions necessary to comply with any applicable law. Notwithstanding the 

7 foregoing and subject to Section 7(b), no portion of a Stock Option may be scheduled to vest in less than 12 months from the Grant Date. (viii) Termination of Service. Except as provided in the applicable Award Agreement or otherwise determined by the Administrator, to the extent Stock Options are not vested and exercisable, a Participant s Stock Options shall be forfeited upon his or her Termination of Service. (ix) Additional Terms and Conditions. The Administrator may, by way of the Award Agreement or otherwise, determine such other terms, conditions, restrictions, and/or limitations, if any, of any Award of Stock Options, provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan. (x) Notice of Exercise. Subject to the conditions of Section 7(c)(xii) and such Determinations regarding administration as the Administrator may from time to time adopt, Stock Options may be exercised only by delivery to the Administrator, or its designee, notice, in such form as is permitted by the Administrator or its designee, stating the number of shares of Common Stock being purchased, the method of payment, and such other matters as may be considered appropriate by the Price Group or the Administrator in connection with the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Stock Option, together with payment in full of the exercise price for the number of shares of Common Stock being purchased. The effective date of exercise of a Stock Option (which in no event may be beyond the expiration date of the Stock Option) will be, unless otherwise provided in Determinations adopted by the Administrator: A. in connection with a sell order for the underlying stock that is a Sell-to- Cover Order, a Same-Day-Sale Exercise Order, a Limit Order, a Good-till Cancelled Order or the like, the date on which such sell order is actually executed. B. in connection with an Exercise and Hold (cash exercise) transaction, the date the requisite funds are received by the Payroll and Stock Transaction Group of Price Group, or its successor by title or with respect to duties and responsibilities, at its home office in Baltimore, Maryland or such other location as Price Group may designate, or by a third party duly designated by Price Group at the offices of such third party, in the manner determined by the Administrator. Provided, however, that if the date of exercise, as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 7(x), including any Determinations adopted by the Administrator, is not a Trading Date, the date of exercise will be deemed to be the next Trading Date. Further, if an exercise instruction is received after the close of the national securities exchange that is the principal trading market for the Common Stock on a particular day, it will be deemed received as of the opening of the next Trading Date. If a Stock Option is granted in tandem with any other Award, there will be surrendered and cancelled from the related Award at the time of exercise of the Stock Option, in lieu of exercise of the related Award, that number of shares of Common Stock as equals the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the tandem Stock Option will have been exercised. (xi) Payment. Payment equal to the aggregate exercise price for the shares subject to a Stock Option and for which notice of exercise has been provided by a Participant, including a Participant that has terminated Service, to Price Group, along with any applicable withholding taxes as described in Section 8, will be tendered in full, with the notice of exercise, in cash (including wire or fund transfers, check, bank draft, postal or express money order payable to the of Price Group or other cash equivalent acceptable to the Administrator in its discretion, in each case in a currency acceptable to the Administrator) or, unless otherwise prohibited (x) by Determinations adopted by the Administrator, (y) in a specific Award Agreement, or (z) by law or applicable regulation, by: A. the actual or constructive transfer to Price Group of nonforfeitable, non- restricted shares of Common Stock that have been owned by the Participant for more than six months, or such shorter time as may be permitted by applicable law, prior to the date of exercise; 

8 B. using the net proceeds (after paying all selling fees) from the sale of some (the Sell-to-Cover Exercise Method or all (the Same-Day-Sale Exercise Method ), of the shares of Common Stock received on the exercise of the Stock Option, or from any arrangement pursuant to which a Participant, including those Participants who have terminated Service, irrevocably instructs a broker-dealer to sell a sufficient portion of such shares to pay the exercise price and any withholding obligation, as described in Section 8, and related fees thereon and deliver the sale proceeds directly to Price Group. The value of the shares of Common Stock used in payment of the exercise price under the Sell-to-Cover Exercise Method or the Same-Day-Sale Exercise Method will be the price at which the Common Stock was sold by the broker-dealer functioning under the Sell-to-Cover Exercise Method or the Same-Day-Sale Exercise Method on the effective date of exercise as described in Section 7(x). The amount of the proceeds to be delivered to Price Group by the broker-dealer functioning under the Sell-to-Cover Exercise Method or the Same-Day-Sale Exercise Method will be credited to the Common Stock account of Price Group as consideration for the shares of Common Stock to be issued in accordance with the Sell-to-Cover Exercise or the Same-Day-Sale Exercise Method; C. by surrender for cancellation of shares of Common Stock at the Fair Market Value per share at the time of exercise under a net exercise arrangement; provided, however, that use of a net exercise arrangement cannot result in the Stock Option being settled either in whole or in part for cash payable to the Participant; D. in accordance with such other procedures or in such other forms as the Administrator will from time to time determine; or E. any combination of the above. On payment of all amounts due from the Participant, Price Group will cause certificates for the Common Stock then being purchased to be delivered as directed by the Participant (or the person exercising the Participant s Stock Option in the event of his death) at its principal business office promptly after the date of exercise. If the Participant has exercised an Incentive Stock Option Price Group may at its option retain physical possession of the certificate evidencing the shares acquired on exercise until the expiration of the holding periods described in section 422(a)(1) of the Code. The obligation of Price Group to deliver shares of Common Stock will, however, be subject to the condition that if at any time the Administrator will determine in its discretion that the listing, registration or qualification of the Stock Option or the Common Stock upon any securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the Stock Option or the issuance or purchase of shares of Common Stock thereunder, the Stock Option may not be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval will have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Administrator. (xii) Automatic Exercise. As a convenience and as a protection against inadvertent expiration of a Stock Option, at close of business on the Final Exercise Date (or the preceding Trading Date if the Final Exercise Date is not a Trading Date), if the Exercise Spread Test (defined below) is met, any vested Stock Option held by a Participant will be automatically exercised using the net exercise method described above, without regard to the notice requirement and with additional shares retained for purposes of satisfying the minimum applicable tax withholdings (the Automatic Exercise ). The Stock Option satisfies the Exercise Spread Test if the per share spread between the closing price of the Common Stock and the exercise price on the Grant Date (the Exercise Spread on the Final Exercise Date is at least one dollar. If the Exercise Spread Test is not satisfied, the unexercised portion of the Stock Option will expire as of close of business on the Final Exercise Date. For avoidance of doubt, a Participant may exercise any exercisable portion of a Stock Option prior to the time of an Automatic Exercise and no portion of the Stock Option may or will be exercised at or after a Participant s termination for Cause. 

9 (d) Limitation on Reload Options. Other than to fulfill Price Group s obligation under any outstanding Award granted under a Prior Plan, the Administrator shall not grant Stock Options under this Plan that contain a reload or replenishment feature pursuant to which a new Stock Option would be granted upon receipt of delivery of Common Stock to Price Group in payment of the exercise price or any tax withholding obligation under any other Stock Option. (e) Stock Appreciation Rights. The Administrator may grant Stock Appreciation Rights alone or in tandem with other Awards granted under this Plan to any Eligible Individual. The Administrator will determine the provisions, terms and conditions of each Stock Appreciation Right including, but not limited to, the vesting schedule, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Stock Appreciation Right, the exercise price of the Stock Appreciation Right, the period during which the Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised, repurchase provisions, forfeiture provisions, acceleration of vesting, if any, in connection with certain termination events, and all other terms and conditions of the Stock Appreciation Right, subject to the following: (i) Form of Stock Appreciation Right. Each Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan will be evidenced by an Award Agreement (which need not be the same for each recipient of a Stock Appreciation Right) that is not inconsistent with the Plan. (ii) Exercise Period. Unless a shorter or longer period is otherwise provided in an Award Agreement and permitted by applicable law and subject to the provisions of Section 7(e)(x), each Stock Appreciation Right will expire and all rights thereunder will cease ten years after the Grant date. (iii) Exercise Price and Terms. The exercise price of a Stock Appreciation Right will be not less than 100 of the Fair Market Value of a share of the Common Stock on the Grant Date of the Stock Appreciation Right and during its term the Stock Appreciation Right will be exercisable only as set forth in the Award Agreement. (iv) Dividend and Dividend Equivalents. No grant of a Stock Appreciation Right may provide for dividends, dividend equivalents, or other similar distributions to be paid in connection with the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right. (v) Exercise. The grant of a Stock Appreciation Right entitles the Participant to receive, subject to the provisions of the Plan and the Award Agreement, that number of shares of Common Stock, or, at the discretion of the Administrator or is designee, cash having an aggregate value equal to the product of (i) the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of one share of Common Stock over (B) the exercise price per share specified in the Award Agreement, times (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock specified by the Stock Appreciation Right, or portion thereof, which is exercised. The exercise price per share specified in the Award Agreement shall not be less than the lower of the Fair Market Value on the Grant date or the exercise price of any tandem Stock Option to which the Stock Appreciation Right is related, or with respect to Stock Appreciation Rights that are granted in substitution of similar types of awards of a company acquired by Price Group or an Affiliate or with which Price Group or an Affiliate combines (whether in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a merger, combination, consolidation or acquisition of property or stock, or otherwise) such exercise price as is necessary to preserve the intrinsic value of such awards (vi) Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights. A Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Incentive Stock Option (i) may be exercised at, and only at, the times and to the extent the related Incentive Stock Option is exercisable, (ii) will expire upon the termination or expiration of the related Incentive Stock Option, (iii) may not result in a Participant realizing more than 100 of the difference between the exercise price of the related Incentive Stock Option and the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock subject to the related Incentive Stock Option at the time the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised, and (iv) may be exercised at, and only at, such times as the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock subject to the related Incentive Stock Option exceeds the 

10 exercise price of the related Incentive Stock Option. A Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with a Non-Qualified Stock Option will be exercisable as provided by the Administrator and will have such other terms and conditions as the Administrator may determine. A Stock Appreciation Right may be transferred at, and only at, the times and to the extent the related Stock Option is transferable. If a Stock Appreciation Right is granted in tandem with any other Equity Award, there will be surrendered and cancelled from the related Equity Award at the time of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right, in lieu of exercise of the related Equity Award, that number of shares of Common Stock as will equal the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the tandem Stock Appreciation Right will have been exercised. (vii) Certain Limitations on Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights. A stand-alone Stock Appreciation Right will be exercisable as provided by the Administrator and will have such other terms and conditions as the Administrator may determine at the time of grant and included in the Award Agreement. A stand-alone Stock Appreciation Right is subject to such acceleration of vesting rights as the Administrator may determine. (viii) Limited Stock Appreciation Rights. The Administrator may grant Stock Appreciation Rights which will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of such events as the Administrator may designate at the time of grant and include in the Award Agreement. Such a Stock Appreciation Right may be issued either as a stand-alone Stock Appreciation Right or in tandem with a Stock Option. (ix) Method of Exercise. Subject to the conditions of this Section 7(e)(ix) and such Determinations regarding administration as the Administrator may from time to time adopt, a Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised only by delivery to the Company, or its designee, of notice, in such form as is permitted by the Administrator or its designee, stating the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is to be exercised. Unless otherwise provided in Determinations adopted by the Administrator, the effective date of exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right will be the date of receipt of the written notice by Price Group at its home office in Baltimore, Maryland or such other location as Price Group may designate, or by a third party duly designated by the Administrator, in the manner determined by the Administrator or its designee. If the date of receipt of written notice of exercise is not a Trading Date, the date of exercise will be deemed to be the next Trading Date. Further, if notice of exercise is received after the close of the NASDAQ on a particular day it will be deemed received as of the opening of the next Trading Date. (x) Tolling of Stock Appreciation Right Exercise Period. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if, by its terms, a Stock Appreciation Right would expire when trading in shares of Common Stock is otherwise prohibited by law or by the Company s insider trading policy, as such may be amended from time to time, the expiration of the Stock Appreciation Right shall be tolled and the term of the Stock Appreciation Right will be automatically extended until the close of trading on the 30th day following the expiration of any such prohibition. (xi) Automatic Exercise. As a convenience and as a protection against inadvertent expiration of a Stock Appreciation Right, at close of business on the Final Exercise Date (or the preceding Trading Date if the Final Exercise Date is not a Trading Date), if the Exercise Spread Test (defined below) is met, any vested Stock Appreciation Right held by a Participant will be automatically exercised without regard to the notice requirement and with additional shares retained for purposes of satisfying the minimum applicable tax withholdings (the Automatic Exercise ). The Stock Appreciation Right satisfies the Exercise Spread Test if the per share spread between the closing price of the Common Stock and the exercise price on the Grant Date (the Exercise Spread on the Final Exercise Date is at least one dollar. If the Exercise Spread Test is not satisfied, the unexercised portion of the Stock Appreciation Right will expire as of close of business on the Final Exercise Date. For avoidance of doubt, a Participant may exercise any exercisable portion of a Stock Appreciation Right prior to the time of an Automatic Exercise and no portion of the Stock Appreciation Right may or will be exercised at or after a Participant s termination for Cause. 

11 (xii) Additional Terms and Conditions. The Administrator may, by way of the Award Agreement or otherwise, determine such other terms, conditions, restrictions, and/or limitations, if any, of any Award of Stock Appreciation Rights, provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan. (f) Prohibition on Repricing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, after the date of grant the terms of stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights granted under the Plan may not be amended to reduce the exercise price of the Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights except in connection with a corporate transaction involving Price Group (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, special cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split- up, spin-off, combination, or exchange of shares), unless such action is approved by Price Group s stockholders pursuant to Section 15(b). (g) Exercise Periods for Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights on a Termination of Service. Unless (x) otherwise modified pursuant to Determinations adopted by the Administrator before or after the granting of an Award, or (y) a more generous post-termination exercise period is otherwise provided with respect to a particular termination event listed in this Section 7(g) (A) in any written agreement between a Participant and the Company that may at any time be in effect, or (B) in the absence of an agreement between a Participant and the Company (as determined by the Administrator, or its designee) that may at any time be in effect, in an applicable Award Agreement, and subject to the Award s original expiration or termination date, a Participant will have the right to exercise a Stock Option or a Stock Appreciation Right following a Termination of Service as follows: (i) Voluntary Termination of Service and Termination of Service Without Cause. If a Participant voluntarily terminates Service with the Company, or the Participant s Service with the Company is terminated involuntarily without Cause, and the termination of the Participant s Service would not otherwise qualify the Participant for any of the post-termination exercise periods described in Section 7(g)(v), any vested but unexercised Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights will be exercisable through the earlier of (x) 90 days after the date on which the Participant s Service terminates, and (y) the Award s original expiration or termination date. Any Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights that are not vested or exercisable on the effective date of the Participant s voluntary Termination of Service or involuntary Termination of Service other than for Cause shall, unless eligible for post-termination vesting pursuant to Section 7(q), immediately expire, terminate, or be forfeited and cancelled as of the effective date of the Participant s relevant Termination of Service. (ii) Termination of Service with Cause. If the Participant s Service with the Company is terminated for Cause, then, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any applicable Award Agreement, all Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights granted to the Participant, whether vested, exercisable or otherwise, will immediately expire, terminate, or be forfeited and cancelled as of the effective date of the Participant s Termination of Service. (iii) Termination of Service as a Result of Total and Permanent Disability. If the Participant s Service with the Company is terminated as a result of the Participant s Total and Permanent Disability, any Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights that were vested, but unexercised on the date of the Participant s Termination of Service will continue to be exercisable through the earlier of (x) the later of (A) 13 months following the effective date of the Participant s Termination of Service as a result of the Participant s Disability, and (B) the date specified in any applicable post-termination exercise period described in Section 7(g)(v), and (y) the Award s original expiration or termination date. (iv) Termination of Service as a Result of Death or Death during Post-termination Exercise Period. If the Participant s Service with the Company is terminated as a result of the Participant s death, or if the Participant dies during any of the post-termination exercise periods described in Section 7(g)(i) or (v), any Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights that were vested, but unexercised as of the date of the Participant s death will continue to be exercisable by the Participant s personal representative, or any beneficiary or legatee to whom the Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights have been transferred through the earlier of (x) the later of (A) 13 months following the effective date of the Participant s death, and (B) the date specified in any applicable post-termination exercise period described in Section 7(g)(v), and (y) the Award s original expiration or termination date. If a Participant is eligible for 

12 post-termination exercise benefits under this Section 7(g)(iv) and the post-termination vesting benefits under Section 7(q), then this Section 7(g)(iv) shall apply to all Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Rights that are vested as of the date of the Participant s Termination of Service and Section 7(q) shall apply to all Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Rights that vest as a result of that Section. Any person seeking to exercise a Participant s Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights following the Participant s death must provide to the Administrator or its designee all documentation that the Administrator or its designee may request to establish (x) the Participant s death and (y) that person s right to exercise the Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights. (v) Termination of Service Following satisfaction of Specified Age and Service Requirements. If when a Participant terminates Service with the Company the Participant has attained the age and cumulative years of Service credit with the Company, including service with any successor to the Company, described in this Section 7(g)(v) then the period during which a Participant may exercise any Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights that were vested, but unexercised as of the date of the Participant s Termination of Service will be determined as follows: A. Termination after Attaining Age 55 with 10 Years of Service. If, as of the date of the Participant s Termination of Service, the Participant has attained age 55, but not yet attained age 58, and the Participant has at least ten years of Service credit with the Company (as determined by the Administrator), including Service with any successor to the Company, the Participant s vested Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights will terminate as of the earlier of (x) 13 months after the date on which the Participant s Service terminates, and (y) the Award s original expiration or termination date. B. Termination after Attaining Age 58 with 10 Years of Service. If, as of the date of the Participant s Termination of Service, the Participant has attained age 58, but not yet attained age 60, and has at least ten years of Service credit with the Company (as determined by the Administrator), including Service with any successor to the Company, the Participant s vested Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights will terminate as of the earlier of (x) 36 months after the date on which the Participant s Service terminates, and (ii) the Award s original expiration or termination date. (h) Stock Awards. (i) Grants. The Administrator may from time to time grant to Eligible Individuals Awards of unrestricted Common Stock or Restricted Stock (collectively, Stock Awards on such terms and conditions, and for such consideration, including no consideration or such minimum consideration as may be required by law, as the Administrator shall determine, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7(b). Stock Awards shall be evidenced in such manner as the Administrator may deem appropriate, including via book-entry registration. (ii) Vesting. Restricted Stock shall be subject to such vesting, restrictions on transferability and other restrictions, if any, and/or risk of forfeiture as the Administrator may impose at the date of grant or thereafter. The Restriction Period to which such vesting, restrictions and/or risk of forfeiture apply may lapse under such circumstances, including without limitation upon the attainment of Performance Goals, in such installments, or otherwise, as the Administrator may determine. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement, during the Restriction Period, the Participant shall not be permitted to sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber shares of Restricted Stock. (iii) Rights of a Stockholder; Dividends. Except to the extent restricted under the Award Agreement relating to the Restricted Stock, a Participant granted Restricted Stock shall have all of the rights of a stockholder of Common Stock including, without limitation, the right to vote Restricted Stock. Dividends declared payable on Restricted Stock shall be paid either at the dividend payment date or deferred for payment to such later date as determined by the Administrator, and shall be paid in cash or as unrestricted shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such dividends or may be reinvested in additional shares of Restricted Stock; provided, however, that 

13 dividends declared payable on Restricted Stock that is granted as a Performance Award shall be held by Price Group and made subject to forfeiture at least until achievement of the applicable Performance Goal related to such shares of Restricted Stock. Stock distributed in connection with a stock split or stock dividend, and other property distributed as a dividend, shall be subject to restrictions and a risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the Restricted Stock with respect to which such Common Stock or other property has been distributed. As soon as is practicable following the date on which restrictions on any shares of Restricted Stock lapse, Price Group shall deliver to the Participant the certificates for such shares or shall cause the shares to be registered in the Participant s name in book-entry form, in either case with the restrictions removed, provided that the Participant shall have complied with all conditions for delivery of such shares contained in the Award Agreement or otherwise reasonably required by Price Group. (iv) Termination of Service. Except as provided in Determinations adopted by the Administrator or the applicable Award Agreement, upon Termination of Service during the applicable Restriction Period, Restricted Stock and any accrued but unpaid dividends that are at that time subject to restrictions shall be forfeited; provided that, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7(b), the Administrator may provide, by rule or regulation or in any Award Agreement, or may determine in any individual case, that restrictions or forfeiture conditions relating to Restricted Stock will be waived in whole or in part in the event of terminations resulting from specified causes, and the Administrator may in other cases waive in whole or in part the forfeiture of Restricted Stock. (v) Additional Terms and Conditions. The Administrator may, by way of the Award Agreement or otherwise, determine such other terms, conditions, restrictions, and/or limitations, if any, of any Award of Restricted Stock, provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan. (i) Stock Units. (i) Grants. The Administrator may from time to time grant to Eligible Individuals Awards of unrestricted stock Units or Restricted Stock Units on such terms and conditions, and for such consideration, including no consideration or such minimum consideration as may be required by law, as the Administrator shall determine, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7(b). Restricted Stock Units represent a contractual obligation by Price Group to deliver a number of shares of Common Stock, an amount in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of the specified number of shares subject to the Award, or a combination of shares of Common Stock and cash, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement. (ii) Vesting and Payment. Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to such vesting, risk of forfeiture and/or payment provisions as the Administrator may impose at the date of grant. The Restriction Period to which such vesting and/or risk of forfeiture apply may lapse under such circumstances, including without limitation upon the attainment of Performance Goals, in such installments, or otherwise, as the Administrator may determine. Shares of Common Stock, cash or a combination of shares of Common Stock and cash, as applicable, payable in settlement of Restricted Stock Units shall be delivered to the Participant as soon as administratively practicable, but no later than 30 days, after the date on which payment is due under the terms of the Award Agreement provided that the Participant shall have complied with all conditions for delivery of such shares or payment contained in the Award Agreement or otherwise reasonably required by Price Group, or in accordance with an election of the Participant, if the Administrator so permits, that meets the requirements of section 409A of the Code. (iii) No Rights of a Stockholder; Dividend Equivalents. Until shares of Common Stock are issued to the Participant in settlement of stock Units, the Participant shall not have any rights of a stockholder of Price Group with respect to the stock Units or the shares issuable thereunder. The Administrator may grant to the Participant the right to receive Dividend Equivalents on stock Units, on a current, reinvested and/or restricted basis, subject to such terms as the Administrator may determine provided, however, that Dividend Equivalents payable on stock Units that are granted as a Performance Award shall, rather than be paid on a current basis, be accrued and made subject to forfeiture at least until achievement of the applicable Performance Goal related to such stock Units. 

14 (iv) Termination of Service. Upon Termination of Service during the applicable deferral period or portion thereof to which forfeiture conditions apply, or upon failure to satisfy any other conditions precedent to the delivery of shares of Common Stock or cash to which such Restricted Stock Units relate, all Restricted Stock Units and any accrued but unpaid Dividend Equivalents with respect to such Restricted Stock Units that are then subject to deferral or restriction shall be forfeited; provided that, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7(b), the Administrator may provide, by rule or regulation or in any Award Agreement, or may determine in any individual case, that restrictions or forfeiture conditions relating to Restricted Stock Units will be waived in whole or in part in the event of termination resulting from specified causes, and the Administrator may in other cases waive in whole or in part the forfeiture of Restricted Stock Units. (v) Additional Terms and Conditions. The Administrator may, by way of the Award Agreement or otherwise, determine such other terms, conditions, restrictions, and/or limitations, if any, of any Award of stock Units, provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan. (j) Performance Shares and Performance Units. (i) Grants. The Administrator may from time to time grant to Eligible Individuals Awards in the form of Performance Shares and Performance Units. Performance Shares, as that term is used in this Plan, shall refer to shares of Common Stock or Units that are expressed in terms of Common Stock, the issuance, vesting, lapse of restrictions on or payment of which is contingent on attainment of a Performance Goal as measured against a Performance Metric over a specified Performance Period. Performance Units, as that term is used in this Plan, shall refer to dollar-denominated Units valued by reference to designated criteria established by the Administrator, other than Common Stock, the issuance, vesting, lapse of restrictions on or payment of which is contingent on attainment of a Performance Goal as measured against a Performance Metric over a specified Performance Period. The applicable Award Agreement shall specify whether Performance Shares and Performance Units will be settled or paid in cash or shares of Common Stock or a combination of both, or shall reserve to the Administrator or the Participant the right to make that determination prior to or at the payment or settlement date. (ii) Performance Criteria. The Administrator shall, prior to or at the time of grant, condition the grant, vesting or payment of, or lapse of restrictions on, an Award of Performance Shares or Performance Units upon (A) the attainment of Performance Goal(s) based on a Performance Metric over a Performance Period or (B) the attainment of Performance Goal(s) based on a Performance Metric over a Performance Period and the continued service of the Participant. The length of the Performance Period, the Performance Metric to be used, the Performance Goal(s) to be achieved during the Performance Period, and the measure of whether and to what degree such Performance Goal(s) have been attained shall be conclusively determined by the Administrator in the exercise of its absolute discretion. Performance Goals may include minimum, maximum and target levels of performance, with the size of the Award or payout of Performance Shares or Performance Units or the vesting or lapse of restrictions with respect thereto based on the level attained. Performance Goals may be based on the Company s consolidated results or on the results of any segment or other subset of the Company s business and may be based solely on the Company s performance or on the Company s performance relative to a Peer Company or a group of Peer Companies. An Award of Performance Shares or Performance Units shall be settled as and when the Award vests or at a later time specified in the Award Agreement or in accordance with an election of the Participant, if the Administrator so permits, that meets the requirements of section 409A of the Code. (iii) Certification and Payment. Following completion of the applicable Performance Period, and prior to any, as applicable, grant, vesting, lapse of restrictions on or payment of a Performance Shares or Performance Units, the Administrator shall determine based on the terms of the Award (i) whether the applicable Performance Goal(s) were achieved, or the level of such achievement, and (ii) the amount, if any, of the Performance Shares or the Performance Units earned by the Participant based on such performance and shall certify all such determinations in writing. For this purpose, approved minutes of the meeting of the Administrator at which certification is made shall be sufficient to 

15 satisfy the requirement of a written certification. No Performance Shares or Performance Units will be granted, become vested, have restrictions lapse or be paid, as applicable, for a Performance Period until such certification is made by the Administrator. The amount of an Award of Performance Shares or Performance Units actually granted, vested, or paid to a Participant, or with respect to which restrictions shall lapse, may be less than the amount determined by the applicable Performance Goal formula, at the discretion of the Administrator to take into account additional factors that the Administrator may deem relevant to the assessment of individual or corporate performance for the Performance Period or otherwise, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Award Agreement (iv) Additional Terms and Conditions. The Administrator may, by way of the Award Agreement or otherwise, determine such other terms, conditions, restrictions, and/or limitations, if any, of any Award of Performance Shares or Performance Units, provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan. (k) Restricted Fund Units. (i) Grants. The Administrator may from time to time grant to Eligible Individuals Awards of Restricted Fund Units on such terms and conditions and subject to such Performance Goals as the Administrator may determine. Restricted Fund Units represent a contractual obligation by Price Group to deliver an amount in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Fund Units subject to the Award, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, any relevant Determinations and any applicable Award Agreement. (ii) Award Value. A Participant s Award of Restricted Fund Units shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, or its authorized designee, initially be valued in United States dollars. In any calendar year in which a Participant receives an Award of Restricted Fund Units, the Participant shall select the Measurement Fund(s) in which the value of the Participant s Restricted Fund Unit Award shall be notionally invested for the purpose of crediting or debiting hypothetical investment earnings (gains and losses) on such Award. A Participant s Measurement Fund election with respect to a particular Restricted Fund Unit Award shall be irrevocable for the life of that Restricted Fund Unit Award. The dollar value of the Participant s Restricted Fund Unit Award shall be notionally invested in the Measurement Fund(s) selected by the Participant based on the (i) the Participant s percentage allocation of the value of the Participant s Restricted Fund Unit Award among the various Measurement Fund(s) selected by the Participant and (ii) the closing Net Asset Value Per Share of the Measurement Fund(s) selected by the Participant on the Grant Date. (iii) Measurement Funds and Notional Investment. The Administrator, or its authorized designee, shall select the menu of Measurement Fund(s) from among which a Participant may choose to notionally invest his/her Restricted Fund Unit Award. The Administrator, or its authorized designee, shall monitor each Measurement Fund and shall make such changes in the menu of Measurement Funds available to Participants as the Administrator, or its authorized designee, sees fit, in its sole and absolute discretion. If a particular Measurement Fund ceases to be available as a notional investment offering, the Administrator, or its authorized designee, may identify an alternate Measurement Fund with a similar risk/return profile as the Measurement Fund that ceased to be available to Participants in which to notionally invest all or the relevant portion of the Participant s Restricted Fund Unit Award(s). Absent such action by the Administrator, or its authorized designee, the portion of a Participant s Restricted Fund Unit Award previously allocated to the Measurement Fund that is no longer available as a notional investment will be reallocated on a pro rata basis among the remaining Measurement Fund(s) in which the Participant s Restricted Fund Unit Award is notionally invested based on the remaining Measurement Funds relative proportional contribution to the overall Award value. If a Participant fails to select a Measurement Fund in which the Participant s Restricted Fund Unit Award will be notionally invested or if a Measurement Fund ceases to be available as a notional investment offering and no other Measurement Fund(s) are selected or designated by the Participant or the Administrator, or its authorized representative, as a substitute for the Measurement Fund that ceased to be available, then the value of the Participant s Restricted Fund Unit Award(s) shall be notionally invested in the Default Measurement Fund. 

16 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan that may be interpreted to the contrary, the Measurement Funds are to be used for measurement purposes only, and the calculation of hypothetical investment earnings and the crediting or debiting of such earnings to a Participant's Restricted Fund Unit Award and shall not be considered or construed in any manner as an actual investment of Participant s Restricted Fund Unit Award in any such Measurement Fund. (iv) Crediting or Debiting Method. The performance of the Restricted Fund Unit Awards, either positive or negative, will be determined by the Administrator, or its authorized designee, in its sole discretion, based on the performance of the Measurement Fund(s) in which the Restricted Fund Unit Award is notionally invested. Any distribution (e.g., dividends) by a Measurement Fund during any period in which a Participant s Restricted Fund Unit Award is notionally invested in such Measurement Fund shall be deemed notionally reinvested in the same Measurement Fund. A Participant's Restricted Fund Unit Award shall be credited or debited with earnings on a daily basis based on the performance of each Measurement Fund(s) in which the Participant s Restricted Fund Unit Award is notionally invested, or as otherwise determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, as though (i) the value of a Participant's Restricted Fund Unit Award was invested in the Measurement Fund(s) selected by the Participant, as of the Grant Date of the Participant s Restricted Fund Unit Award, based on the closing Net Asset Value Per Share of the applicable Measurement Fund(s) on that date; and (ii) the value of any amount distributed to a Participant that decreases the dollar value of a Participant s Restricted Fund Unit Award ceased being invested in the Measurement Fund(s) selected by the Participant, in the percentages applicable on the day on which the relevant tranche of the Restricted Fund Unit Award vests, the relevant risk of forfeiture lapses, and/or any other payment provisions imposed by the Administrator, including the satisfaction of any applicable Performance Goal, is satisfied. (v) Vesting and Payment. Restricted Fund Units shall be subject to such vesting, risk of forfeiture and/or payment provisions as the Administrator may impose as of the Grant Date. The period over which such vesting and/or risk of forfeiture provisions may lapse and under such circumstances, including without limitation upon the attainment of Performance Goals, in such installments, or otherwise, as the Administrator may determine. Cash payable in settlement of Restricted Fund Units shall be delivered to the Participant in the Participant s local currency (based on a conversion rate determined by the Administrator, or the Administrator s authorized designee, and consistent with established policy) as soon as administratively practicable after any applicable portion of the Restricted Fund Unit Award vests, any applicable risk of forfeiture lapses, and/or any applicable Performance Goal is attained and the Participant earns a nonforfeitable right to such payment under the terms of the applicable Award Agreement, but no later than the 15th day of the third month of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant earns such nonforfeitable right to the payment provided that the Participant shall have complied with all conditions for delivery of such payment contained in the Award Agreement or otherwise reasonably required by Price Group, or in accordance with an election of the Participant, if the Administrator so permits, that meets the requirements of section 409A of the Code. (vi) Termination of Service. Upon Termination of Service during the applicable deferral period or portion thereof to which forfeiture conditions apply, or upon failure to satisfy any other conditions precedent to the delivery of cash to which such Award of Restricted Fund Units relate, all Restricted Fund Units that are then subject to deferral or restriction shall be forfeited; provided that, the Administrator may provide, by rule or regulation or in any Award Agreement, or may determine in any individual case, that restrictions or forfeiture conditions relating to all or any portion of an Award of Restricted Fund Units will be waived in whole or in part in the event of termination resulting from specified causes, and the Administrator may in other cases waive in whole or in part the forfeiture of Restricted Fund Units. (vii) Additional Terms and Conditions. The Administrator may, by way of the Award Agreement or otherwise, determine such other terms, conditions, restrictions, and/or limitations, if any, of any Award of Restricted Fund Units, provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan. (l) Other Stock-Based Awards. The Administrator may from time to time grant to Eligible Individuals Awards in the form of Other Stock-Based Awards, which may be Performance Awards. Other 

17 Stock-Based Awards in the form of Dividend Equivalents may be (A) awarded on a free-standing basis or in connection with another Award other than a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, (B) paid currently or credited to an account for the Participant, including the reinvestment of such credited amounts in Common Stock equivalents, to be paid on a deferred basis, and (C) settled in cash or Common Stock as determined by the Administrator; provided, however, that Dividend Equivalents payable on Other Stock-Based Awards that are granted as a Performance Award shall, rather than be paid on a current basis, be accrued and made subject to forfeiture at least until achievement of the applicable Performance Goal related to such Other Stock- Based Awards. Any such settlements, and any such crediting of Dividend Equivalents, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Administrator shall establish. (m) Awards to Participants Outside the United States. The Administrator may grant Awards to Eligible Individuals who are foreign nationals, who are located outside the United States or who are not compensated from a payroll maintained in the United States, or who are otherwise subject to (or could cause Price Group or an Affiliate to be subject to) tax, legal or regulatory provisions of countries or jurisdictions outside the United States, on such terms and conditions different from those specified in the Plan as may, in the judgment of the Administrator, be necessary or desirable in order that any such Award shall conform to laws, regulations, and customs of the country or jurisdiction in which the Participant is then resident or primarily employed or to foster and promote achievement of the purposes of the Plan. (n) Limitation on Dividend Reinvestment and Dividend Equivalents. Reinvestment of dividends in additional Restricted Stock at the time of any dividend payment, and the payment of shares of Common Stock with respect to dividends to Participants holding Awards of stock Units, shall only be permissible if sufficient shares are available under the Share Pool for such reinvestment or payment (taking into account then outstanding Awards). In the event that sufficient shares are not available under the Share Pool for such reinvestment or payment, such reinvestment or payment shall be made in the form of a grant of stock Units equal in number to the shares of Common Stock that would have been obtained by such payment or reinvestment, the terms of which stock Units shall provide for settlement in cash and for Dividend Equivalent reinvestment in further stock Units on the terms contemplated by this Section 7(m). (o) Special Vesting Rules. Unless (x) otherwise modified pursuant to Determinations adopted by the Administrator before or after the granting of an Award, or (y) a more generous vesting provision is otherwise provided with respect to a particular termination event in (A) in any written agreement between a Participant and the Company that may at any time be in effect, or (B) in the absence of an agreement between a Participant and the Company (as determined by the Administrator, or its designee) that may at any time be in effect, in an applicable Award Agreement, all unvested Awards will be immediately forfeited for no consideration on the date of a Participant s Termination of Service. (p) Vesting upon Death or Total and Permanent Disability. All outstanding awards that have not already vested or been previously forfeited will vest and become nonforfeitable on a Participant s death or Termination of Service due to Total and Permanent Disability. (q) Post-Service Vesting Continuation. Unless (x) otherwise modified pursuant to Determinations adopted by the Administrator before or after the granting of an Award, or (y) a more generous vesting provision is otherwise provided with respect to a particular termination event listed in this Section 7(q) (A) in any written agreement between a Participant and the Company that may at any time be in effect, or (B) in the absence of an agreement between a Participant and the Company (as determined by the Administrator, or its designee) that may at any time be in effect, in an applicable Award Agreement: (i) Awards Before December 6, 2021. With respect to Awards made under the Plan before December 6, 2021, if as of the date of a Participant s Termination of Service other than for Cause, death, or Total and Permanent Disability the Participant satisfies any of the combinations of age and years of Service detailed in the table below then any then-unvested Awards that have not been 

18 previously forfeited and that are scheduled to vest during the period immediately following the Participant s eligible Termination of Service will vest and become exercisable as provided in the table below on their scheduled vesting dates set forth in the corresponding Award Agreement notwithstanding the Participant s Termination of Service. Age and Years of Service as of Termination of Service Nonforfeited, Unvested Awards That Will Vest on Their Scheduled Vesting Date Following Termination of Service Age 58 with at least 7 but less than 20 years of Service Unvested Awards that will by their terms vest in the two years immediately following the date of the Termination of Service Age 58 with 20 or more years of Service Unvested Awards that will by their terms vest in the three years immediately following the date of the Termination of Service Age 60 with 10 or more years of Service All unvested Awards that will vest following Termination of Service (ii) Awards On or After December 6, 2021. with respect to Awards made under the Plan on or after December 6, 2021, if as of the date of a Participant s Termination of Service other than for Cause, death, or Total and Permanent Disability the Participant satisfies the Rule of 65 then all then-unvested Awards that have not been previously forfeited and that are scheduled to vest during the period immediately following the Participant s eligible Termination of Service will vest and become exercisable on their scheduled vesting dates set forth in the corresponding Award Agreement notwithstanding the Participant s Termination of Service. Any Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights that become vested pursuant to this Section 7(q) following a Participant s Termination of Service will terminate and become non-exercisable as of the earlier of (x) 3 months after the date on which the last of the Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights subject to this Section 7(q) would otherwise, under the terms of their corresponding Award Agreement, vest, and (y) the Stock Option s or Stock Appreciation Right s original expiration or termination date. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(q) to the contrary, unless the Administrator determines otherwise, upon the occurrence of any Prohibited Action, the following shall occur with respect to a Participant s Awards: (i) no further Awards will become vested and any then-unvested Awards will terminate immediately and be forfeited for no consideration, and (ii) all Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that were vested as of the date on which the Participant s Termination of Service occurred and any Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that became vested pursuant to this Section 7(q) after the Participant s Termination of Service occurred that remain unexercised as of the date of the Prohibited Action shall terminate as of the earlier of (x) the later of (A) 90 days after the date on which the Participant s Termination of Service occurred, and (B) the date on which the Prohibited Action occurred, and (y) the Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights original expiration or termination date. For clarity, unless the Administrator determines otherwise, the Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights described in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence will terminate immediately if a Prohibited Action occurs later than the 90th day after the date on which the Participant s Termination of Service occurred. As a condition of this post-employment vesting provision, for as long as a Participant has outstanding, unvested Awards the Participant shall be required to disclose to the Company the identity of any new employer within two business days of being employed or engaged by such new employer, and in advance of the settlement of any Stock Award or the exercise of any Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights the Participant will provide to the Company information sufficient to confirm that the Participant has not engaged in any Prohibited Actions. 8. Withholding of Taxes. Participants and holders of Awards shall pay to Price Group or its Affiliate, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Administrator for payment of, any Tax Withholding Obligation in respect of Awards granted under the Plan no later than the date of the event creating the tax or social insurance contribution 

19 liability. The obligations of Price Group under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, Tax Withholding Obligations may be settled in whole or in part with shares of Common Stock, including unrestricted outstanding shares surrendered to Price Group and unrestricted shares that are part of the Award that gives rise to the Tax Withholding Obligation, having a value, determined using the Fair Market Value as of the date established by the Administrator or its designee (which may be the closing price as of the day prior to the date any such Award vests or otherwise becomes subject to a Tax Withholding Obligation), equal to the statutory minimum amount (and not any greater amount) required to be withheld for tax or social insurance contribution purposes, all in accordance with such procedures as the Administrator establishes. Price Group or its Affiliate may deduct, to the extent permitted by law, any such Tax Withholding Obligations from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant or holder of an Award. 9. Transferability of Awards. Except as otherwise determined by the Administrator, and in any event in the case of an Incentive Stock Option or a tandem Stock Appreciation Right granted with respect to an Incentive Stock Option, no Award granted under the Plan shall be transferable by a Participant otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. The Administrator shall not permit any transfer of an Award for value. An Award may be exercised during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant or, during the period the Participant is under a legal disability, by the Participant s guardian or legal representative, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator. Awards granted under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to alienation, anticipation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, or encumbrance, except as otherwise determined by the Administrator; provided, however, that the restrictions in this sentence shall not apply to the shares of Common Stock received in connection with an Award after the date that the restrictions on transferability of such shares set forth in the applicable Award Agreement have lapsed. 10. Adjustments for Corporate Transactions and Other Events. (a) Mandatory Adjustments. In the event of a merger, consolidation, stock rights offering, liquidation, statutory share exchange or similar event affecting Price Group (each, a Corporate Event or a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, separation, spinoff, reorganization, extraordinary dividend of cash or other property, share combination or subdivision, or recapitalization or similar event affecting the capital structure of Price Group (each, a Share Change ), the Administrator shall make equitable and appropriate substitutions or proportionate adjustments to (i) the aggregate number and kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities on which Awards under the Plan may be granted to Eligible Individuals, (ii) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock or other securities with respect to which Awards may be granted during any one calendar year to any individual, (iii) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock or other securities that may be issued with respect to Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan, (iv) the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities covered by each outstanding Award and the exercise price or other price per share, if any, and other relevant terms of each outstanding Award, and (v) all other numerical limitations relating to Awards, whether contained in this Plan or in Award Agreements; provided, however, that any fractional shares resulting from any such adjustment shall be eliminated. (b) Discretionary Adjustments. In the case of Corporate Events, the Administrator may make such other adjustments to outstanding Awards as it determines to be appropriate and desirable, which adjustments may include, without limitation, (i) the cancellation of outstanding Awards in exchange for payments of cash, securities or other property or a combination thereof having an aggregate value equal to the value of such Awards, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion (it being understood that in the case of a Corporate Event with respect to which stockholders of Price Group receive consideration other than publicly traded equity securities of the ultimate surviving entity, any such determination by the Administrator that the value of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall for this purpose be deemed to equal the excess, if any, of the value of the consideration being paid for each share of Common Stock pursuant to such Corporate Event over the exercise price of such Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall conclusively be deemed valid and that any Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right may be cancelled for no consideration upon a Corporate Event if its exercise price does not exceed the value of the consideration being paid for each share of Common Stock pursuant to 

20 such Corporate Event), (ii) the substitution of securities or other property (including, without limitation, cash or other securities of Price Group and securities of entities other than Price Group) for the shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding Awards, and (iii) the substitution of equivalent awards, as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator, of the surviving or successor entity or a parent thereof Substitute Awards ). (c) Adjustments to Performance Goals. The Administrator may, in its discretion, adjust the Performance Goals applicable to any Awards to reflect any unusual or non-recurring events and other unusual or non-recurring items, impact of charges for restructurings, discontinued operations and the cumulative effects of accounting or tax changes, each as defined by generally accepted accounting principles or as identified or disclosed in Price Group s financial statements, notes to the financial statements, management s discussion and analysis or other Price Group filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the Administrator determines that a change in the business, operations, corporate structure or capital structure of Price Group or the applicable subsidiary, business segment or other operational unit of Price Group or any such entity or segment, or the manner in which any of the foregoing conducts its business, or other events or circumstances, render the Performance Goals to be unsuitable, the Administrator may modify such Performance Goals or the related minimum acceptable level of achievement, in whole or in part, as the Administrator deems appropriate and equitable. (d) Statutory Requirements Affecting Adjustments. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 10 to Awards that are considered deferred compensation within the meaning of section 409A of the Code shall be made in compliance with the requirements of section 409A of the Code; (B) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 10 to Awards that are not considered deferred compensation subject to section 409A of the Code shall be made in such a manner as to ensure that after such adjustment, the Awards either (1) continue not to be subject to section 409A of the Code or (2) comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code; (C) in any event, the Administrator shall not have the authority to make any adjustments pursuant to Section 10 to the extent the existence of such authority would cause an Award that is not intended to be subject to section 409A of the Code at the date of grant to be subject thereto; and (D) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 10 to Awards that are Incentive Stock Options shall be made in compliance with the requirements of section 424(a) of the Code. (e) Dissolution or Liquidation. Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, all Awards outstanding under the Plan shall terminate upon the dissolution or liquidation of Price Group. 11. Change in Control Provisions. (a) Termination of Awards. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11(b), in the event that any transaction resulting in a Change in Control occurs, outstanding Awards will terminate upon the effective time of such Change in Control unless provision is made in connection with the transaction for the continuation or assumption of such Awards by, or for the issuance of Substitute Awards of, the surviving or successor entity or a parent thereof. In the event of such termination, (i) the outstanding Awards that will terminate upon the effective time of the Change in Control shall, immediately before the effective time of the Change in Control, become fully exercisable, be considered to be earned and payable in full, any deferral or other restriction thereon shall lapse, and any Restriction Period thereon shall terminate, (ii) the holders of Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and other Awards granted under the Plan that are exchangeable for or convertible into Common Stock will be permitted, immediately before the Change in Control, to exercise or convert all portions of such Awards, and (iii) the Administrator may take any of the actions set forth in Section 10 with respect to any or all Awards granted under the Plan. Implementation of the provisions of the immediately foregoing sentence shall be conditioned upon consummation of the Change in Control. (b) Continuation, Assumption or Substitution of Awards. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement, if a Change in Control occurs under which provision is made in connection with the transaction for the continuation or assumption of outstanding Awards by, or for the issuance of Substitute Awards of, the surviving or successor entity or a parent thereof, then upon a Participant s 

21 Termination of Service during the 18-month period following a Change in Control, (x) by Price Group, an Affiliate, or a successor to Price Group or an Affiliate other than for Cause, Total and Permanent Disability or death or (y) by the Participant for Good Reason: (i) any outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights granted under the Plan to the Participant or any such Substitute Awards which are not then exercisable and vested shall become fully exercisable and vested; (ii) the restrictions and deferral limitations applicable to any shares of Restricted Stock granted under the Plan to the Participant or any such Substitute Awards shall lapse and such shares of Restricted Stock shall become free of all restrictions and become fully vested and transferable; (iii) all Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance Units granted under the Plan to the Participant or any such Substitute Awards shall be considered to be earned and payable at target level, any deferral or other restriction thereon shall lapse, any Restriction Period thereon shall terminate, and such Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance Units or any such Substitute Awards shall be settled in cash or shares of Common Stock (consistent with the terms of the Award Agreement after taking into account the effect of the Change in Control transaction on the shares) as promptly as is practicable; (iv) each outstanding award of Performance Shares or Performance Units granted under the Plan to the Participant or any such Substitute Award shall be deemed to satisfy any applicable Performance Goals as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement; and (v) subject to Section 15, the Administrator may also make additional adjustments and/or settlements of outstanding Awards granted to the Participant or any Substitute Awards as it deems appropriate and consistent with the Plan s purposes. (c) Section 409A Savings Clause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Award is considered a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of section 409A of the Code, this Section 11 shall apply to such Award only to the extent that its application would not result in the imposition of any tax or interest or the inclusion of any amount in income under section 409A of the Code. 12. Substitution of Awards in Mergers and Acquisitions. Awards may be granted under the Plan from time to time in substitution for assumed awards held by employees, officers, consultants or directors of entities who become employees, officers, consultants or directors of Price Group or an Affiliate as the result of a merger or consolidation of the entity for which they perform services with Price Group or an Affiliate, or the acquisition by Price Group or an Affiliate of the assets or stock of the such entity. The terms and conditions of any Awards so granted may vary from the terms and conditions set forth herein to the extent that the Administrator deems appropriate at the time of grant to conform the Awards to the provisions of the assumed awards for which they are substituted and to preserve their intrinsic value as of the date of the merger, consolidation or acquisition transaction. To the extent permitted by applicable law and marketplace or listing rules of the primary securities market or exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted for trading, any available shares under a stockholder-approved plan of an acquired company (as appropriately adjusted to reflect the transaction) may be used for Awards granted pursuant to this Section 12 and, upon such grant, shall not reduce the Share Pool. 13. Compliance with Securities Laws; Listing and Registration. (a) The obligation of Price Group to sell or deliver Common Stock with respect to any Award granted under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including all applicable federal and state securities laws, and the obtaining of all such approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by the Administrator. If at any time the Administrator determines that the delivery of Common Stock under the Plan is or may be unlawful under 

22 the laws of any applicable jurisdiction, or Federal, state or foreign (non-United States) securities laws, the right to exercise an Award or receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Award shall be suspended until the Administrator determines that such delivery is lawful. If at any time the Administrator determines that the delivery of Common Stock under the Plan is or may violate the rules of any exchange on which Price Group s securities are then listed for trade, the right to exercise an Award or receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Award shall be suspended until the Administrator determines that such delivery would not violate such rules. If the Administrator determines that the exercise or nonforfeitability of, or delivery of benefits pursuant to, any Award would violate any applicable provision of securities laws or the listing requirements of any stock exchange upon which any of Price Group s equity securities are listed, then the Administrator may postpone any such exercise, nonforfeitability or delivery, as applicable, but Price Group shall use all reasonable efforts to cause such exercise, nonforfeitability or delivery to comply with all such provisions at the earliest practicable date. (b) Each Award is subject to the requirement that, if at any time the Administrator determines, in its absolute discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Plan is required by any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the grant of an Award or the issuance of Common Stock, no such Award shall be granted or payment made or Common Stock issued, in whole or in part, unless listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval has been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Administrator. (c) In the event that the disposition of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Plan is not covered by a then current registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and is not otherwise exempt from such registration, such Common Stock shall be restricted against transfer to the extent required by the Securities Act or regulations thereunder, and the Administrator may require a person receiving Common Stock pursuant to the Plan, as a condition precedent to receipt of such Common Stock, to represent to Price Group in writing that the Common Stock acquired by such person is acquired for investment only and not with a view to distribution and that such person will not dispose of the Common Stock so acquired in violation of Federal, state or foreign securities laws and furnish such information as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be appropriate to permit the Company to issue the Common Stock in compliance with applicable Federal, state or foreign securities laws. 14. Section 409A Compliance. All Awards under the Plan are intended to comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, section 409A of the Code and all Awards shall be administered, interpreted and construed in a manner consistent with this intent. Should any provision of an Award be found not to comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, the provisions of section 409A of the Code, it shall be modified and given effect, in the sole discretion of the Administrator and without requiring a participant s consent, in such manner as the Administrator determines to be necessary or appropriate to comply with, or to effectuate an exemption from, section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Price Group nor any of its Affiliates nor any of its or their directors, officers, employees, agents or other service providers will be liable for any taxes, penalties or interest imposed on any Participant or other person with respect to any amounts paid or payable (whether in cash, shares of Common Stock or other property) under any Award, including any taxes, penalties or interest imposed under or as a result of section 409A of the Code. Any payments described in an Award that are due within the short term deferral period as defined in section 409A of the Code shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. For purposes of any Award, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided to a Participant that constitutes deferred compensation subject to section 409A of the Code shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of section 409A of the Code. For purposes of section 409A of the Code, the payment of Dividend Equivalents under any Award shall be construed as earnings and the time and form of payment of such Dividend Equivalents shall be treated separately from the time and form of payment of the underlying Award. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, with respect to any Award that constitutes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the 

23 meaning of section 409A of the Code, any payments (whether in cash, shares of Common Stock or other property) to be made with respect to the Award that become payable on account of the Participant s separation from service, within the meaning of section 409A of the Code, while the Participant is a specified employee (as determined in accordance with the uniform policy adopted by the Administrator with respect to all of the arrangements subject to section 409A of the Code maintained by Price Group and its Affiliates) and which would otherwise be paid within six months after the Participant s separation from service shall be accumulated (without interest) and paid on the first day of the seventh month following the Participant s separation from service or, if earlier, within 15 days after the appointment of the personal representative or executor of the Participant s estate following the Participant s death. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Administrator exercise its discretion to accelerate the payment or settlement of an Award where such payment or settlement constitutes deferred compensation within the meaning of Code section 409A unless, and solely to the extent that, such accelerated payment or settlement is permissible under Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-3(j)(4). 15. Plan Duration; Amendment and Discontinuance. (a) Plan Duration. The Plan shall remain in effect, subject to the right of the Board or the ECMDC to amend or terminate the Plan at any time, until the earlier of (a) the earliest date as of which all Awards granted under the Plan have been satisfied in full or terminated and no shares of Common Stock approved for issuance under the Plan remain available to be granted under new Awards or (b) February 12, 2030. No Awards shall be granted under the Plan after such termination date. Subject to other applicable provisions of the Plan, all Awards made under the Plan on or before February 12, 2030, or such earlier termination of the Plan, shall remain in effect until such Awards have been satisfied or terminated in accordance with the Plan and the terms of such Awards. (b) Amendment and Discontinuance of the Plan. The Board or the ECMDC may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan, but no amendment, alteration or discontinuation shall be made which would materially impair the rights of a Participant with respect to a previously granted Award without such Participant s consent, except to the extent that amendment was made to comply with applicable law or rule of any securities exchange or market on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted for trading or to prevent adverse tax or accounting consequences to Price Group or the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such amendment shall be made without the approval of Price Group s stockholders to the extent such amendment would (A) materially increase the number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the Plan or to a Participant, (B) materially expand the eligibility for participation in the Plan, (C) eliminate or modify the prohibition set forth in Section 7(f) on repricing of Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, (D) lengthen the maximum term or lower the minimum exercise price permitted for Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, (E) modify the limitation on the issuance of reload or replenishment options, (F) reduce the exercise price of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right or permit outstanding Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights to be canceled in exchange for (i) cash, (ii) Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original outstanding Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, or (iii) other Awards. Except as otherwise determined by the Board or ECMDC, termination of the Plan shall not affect the Administrator s ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination. (c) Amendment of Awards. Subject to Section 7(f), the Administrator may unilaterally amend the terms of any Award theretofore granted, but no such amendment shall materially impair the rights of any Participant with respect to an Award without the Participant s consent, except such an amendment made to cause the Plan or Award to comply with applicable law, applicable rule of any securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted for trading, or to prevent adverse tax or accounting consequences for the Participant or the Company or any of its Affiliates. 

24 16. General Provisions. (a) Non-Guarantee of Employment or Service. Nothing in the Plan or in any Award Agreement thereunder shall confer any right on an individual to continue in the service of Price Group or any Affiliate or shall interfere in any way with the right of Price Group or any Affiliate to terminate such service at any time with or without cause or notice and whether or not such termination results in (i) the failure of any Award to vest or become payable; (ii) the forfeiture of any unvested or vested portion of any Award; and/or (iii) any other adverse effect on the individual s interests under any Award or the Plan. (b) No Trust or Fund Created. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between Price Group and a Participant or any other person. To the extent that any Participant or other person acquires a right to receive payments from Price Group pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of Price Group. (c) Status of Awards. Awards shall be special incentive payments to the Participant and shall not be taken into account in computing the amount of salary or compensation of the Participant for purposes of determining any pension, retirement, death, severance or other benefit under (a) any pension, retirement, profit-sharing, bonus, insurance, severance or other employee benefit plan of Price Group or any Affiliate now or hereafter in effect under which the availability or amount of benefits is related to the level of compensation or (b) any agreement between Price Group or any Affiliate and the Participant, except as such plan or agreement shall otherwise expressly provide. (d) Affiliate Employees. In the case of a grant of an Award to an Eligible Individual who provides services to any Affiliate, Price Group may, if the Administrator so directs, issue or transfer the shares of Common Stock, if any, covered by the Award to the Affiliate, for such lawful consideration as the Administrator may specify, upon the condition or understanding that the Affiliate will transfer the shares of Common Stock to the Eligible Individual in accordance with the terms of the Award specified by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. All shares of Common Stock underlying Awards that are forfeited or canceled after such issue or transfer of shares to the Affiliate shall revert to Price Group. (e) Governing Law and Interpretation. The validity, construction and effect of the Plan, of any Award Agreement entered into pursuant to the Plan, and of any rules, regulations, Determinations, interpretations, or decisions made by the Administrator relating to the Plan or any Award Agreement, and the rights of any and all persons having or claiming to have any interest therein or thereunder, shall be determined exclusively in accordance with applicable federal laws and the laws of the State of Maryland, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. As a condition of receiving an Award under the Plan a Participant is bound by the terms of this Plan, which include the requirement that the Participant will (i) not bring any action arising under, as a result of, pursuant or relating to, this Plan or any Award Agreement in any court other than a federal or state court in the districts that include Baltimore, Maryland, (ii) submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in the district that includes Baltimore, Maryland or any state court in the district that includes Baltimore, Maryland, and (iii) not deny or attempt to defeat that personal jurisdiction or object to venue by motion or other request for leave from any such court.

(g) Use of English Language. The Plan, each Award Agreement, and all other documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant to an Award shall be written in English, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator. If a Participant receives an Award Agreement, a copy of the Plan or any other documents related to an Award translated into a language other than English, and if the meaning of the translated version is different from the English version, the English version shall control. 

25 (h) Recovery of Amounts Paid. Except as otherwise provided by the Administrator, Awards granted under the Plan shall be subject to Price Group s Policy for Recoupment of Incentive Compensation or any successor thereto (the Recoupment Policy and/or to any provisions set forth in the applicable Award Agreement under which Price Group may recover from current and former Participants any amounts paid or shares of Common Stock issued under an Award and any proceeds therefrom under such circumstances as the Administrator determines appropriate. The Administrator may apply the Recoupment Policy to Awards granted before the policy is adopted to the extent required by applicable law or rule of any securities exchange or market on which shares of Common Stock are listed or admitted for trading, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. (i) Resolution of Disputes. Any dispute or disagreement that shall arise under, or as a result of, or pursuant to or relating to, this Plan or any Award Agreement shall be determined by the Administrator in good faith in its absolute and uncontrolled discretion, and any such determination or any other determination by the Administrator under or pursuant to this Plan or any Award Agreement and any interpretation by the Administrator of the terms of this Plan or any Award Agreement, will be final, binding and conclusive on all persons affected thereby. As part of accepting an Award a Participant agrees that before the Participant may bring any legal action arising under, as a result of, pursuant to or relating to, this Plan or an Award Agreement the Participant will first exhaust the Participant s administrative remedies before the Administrator. A Participant further agrees that in the event that the Administrator does not resolve any dispute or disagreement arising under, as a result of, pursuant to or relating to, this Plan or an Award Agreement to the Participant s satisfaction, no legal action may be commenced or maintained relating to this Plan or an Award Agreement more than 24 months after the Administrator s decision.
