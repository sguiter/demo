 Credit Agreement 
 Aptiv PLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary Aptiv Corporation entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with, among others, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent ), under which it maintains a senior unsecured credit facility currently consisting of a revolving credit facility of billion (the Revolving Credit Facility ). The Revolving Credit Facility matures on June 24, 2026. As of September 30, 2023, the Company also maintained a senior unsecured credit facility in the form of a term loan (the Tranche A Term Loan ). On October 27, 2023, the Company fully repaid the outstanding principal balance of million on the Tranche A Term Loan, utilizing cash on hand. Aptiv Global Financing Designated Activity Company AGF DAC , formerly known as Aptiv Global Financing Limited), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aptiv PLC, previously executed a joinder agreement to the Credit Agreement, which allows it to act as a borrower under the Credit Agreement, and a guaranty supplement, under which AGF DAC guarantees the obligations under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. 
 The Credit Agreement was entered into in March 2011 and has been subsequently amended and restated on several occasions, most recently on June 24, 2021, and was further amended on April 19, 2023. The June 2021 amendment, among other things, (1) refinanced and replaced the term loan A and revolver with a new term loan A with an original maturity in 2026, and a new five-year revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of billion, (2) utilized the Company s existing sustainability-linked metrics and commitments, that, if achieved, would change the facility fee and interest rate margins

to 1.0 (or to 1.0 for four full fiscal quarters following completion of material acquisitions, as defined in the Credit Agreement) and allowed for dividends and other payments on equity. Effective from the date of the April 2023 amendment, all interest rate benchmarks within the Credit Agreement that were previously based on the London Interbank Offered Rate were transitioned to a rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature that permits Aptiv to increase, from time to time, the aggregate borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional billion upon Aptiv s request, the agreement of the lenders participating in the increase, and the approval of the Administrative Agent. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are prepayable at Aptiv s option without premium or penalty. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Aptiv had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and less than million in letters of credit were issued under the Credit Agreement. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement reduce availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at Aptiv s option, at either (a) the Administrative Agent s Alternate Base Rate ABR as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (b) SOFR plus in either case a percentage per annum as set forth in the table below (the Applicable Rate ). 
 The Applicable Rate under the Credit Agreement, as well as the facility fee, may increase or decrease from time to time based on changes in the Company s credit ratings and whether the Company achieves or fails to achieve certain sustainability-linked targets with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and workplace safety. Such adjustments may be up to per annum on interest rate margins on the Revolving Credit Facility, per annum on interest rate margins on the Tranche A Term Loan (prior to its repayment, as described above) and per annum on the facility fee. Accordingly, the interest rate is subject to fluctuation during the term of the Credit Agreement based on changes in the ABR, SOFR, changes in the Company s corporate credit ratings or whether the Company achieves or fails to achieve its sustainability-linked targets. The Credit Agreement also requires that Aptiv pay certain facility fees on the Revolving Credit Facility, which are also subject to adjustment based on the sustainability-linked targets as described above, and certain letter of credit issuance and fronting fees. The Company achieved the sustainability-linked targets for the 2023 calendar year, and the interest rate margins and facility fees were reduced from the Applicable Rates, by the amounts specified above, effective in the third quarter of 2024. 
 The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the Company s (and the Company s subsidiaries ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or liens or to dispose of substantially all of its assets. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than to 1.0 (or to 1.0 for four full fiscal quarters following completion of material acquisitions, as defined in the Credit Agreement). 
 The Credit Agreement also contains events of default customary for financings of this type. The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants as of September 30, 2024.

The proceeds of the loans under the Bridge Credit Agreement were utilized to provide initial funding for a portion of the share repurchases under the accelerated share repurchase program, as further described in Note 12. Shareholders Equity and Net Income Per Share. Aptiv incurred approximately million of issuance costs in connection with the Bridge Credit Agreement. The loans available under the Bridge Credit Agreement were fully drawn on August 1.

In aggregate, the MCPS converted into approximately million ordinary shares of the company, pursuant to the Statement of Rights governing the MCPS. The number of the Company s ordinary shares issued upon conversion was determined based on the volume-weighted average price per share of the Company s ordinary shares over the consecutive trading day period beginning on, and including, the 21st scheduled trading day immediately before the Mandatory Conversion Date. 
 Prior to their conversion, holders of the MCPS were entitled to receive, when and if declared by the Company s Board of Directors, cumulative dividends at the annual rate of of the liquidation preference of per share (equivalent to annually per share), payable in cash or, subject to certain limitations, by delivery of the Company s ordinary shares or any combination of cash and the Company s ordinary shares, at the Company s election.

 Net Income Per Share 
 Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the weighted average dilutive impact of all potentially dilutive securities from the date of issuance and is computed using the treasury stock and if-converted methods. Prior to the conversion of the MCPS into ordinary shares in June 2023, the if-converted method was used to determine if the impact of the conversion of the MCPS into ordinary shares was more dilutive than the MCPS dividends to net income per share. If so, the MCPS were assumed to have been converted at the later of the beginning of the period or the time of issuance, and the resulting ordinary shares were included in the denominator and the MCPS dividends were added back to the numerator. Unless otherwise noted, share and per share amounts included in these notes are on a diluted basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the calculation of net income per share includes the dilutive impacts of the MCPS under the if-converted method. For all periods presented, the calculation of net income per share also contemplates the dilutive impacts, if any, of the Company s share-based compensation plans. Refer to Note 18. Share-Based Compensation for additional information.

 (1) For purposes of calculating net income per share under the if-converted method, the Company has excluded the impact of the MCPS dividends for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as the assumed conversion of the MCPS into ordinary shares on a weighted average basis was more dilutive to net income per share than the impact of the MCPS dividends.

 We are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle, including during periods of reduced industry volumes. Accordingly, we will continue to adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint in response to changes in the global and regional automotive markets and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering as conditions permit. As we operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies, we continually evaluate opportunities to further refine our cost structure, as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations and on reducing our global overhead costs, as described in Note 7. Restructuring to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. We believe our strong balance sheet coupled with our flexible cost structure will position us to capitalize on improvements in OEM production volumes as economic conditions improve.

On October 15, 2024, Aptiv PLC filed a preliminary proxy statement relating to a proposed transaction in which Aptiv will establish a new publicly listed parent company, Aptiv Holdings Limited New Aptiv ), a company that, like Aptiv PLC, will be incorporated under the laws of Jersey, but which will be resident for tax purposes in Switzerland, rather than Ireland, as is currently the case for Aptiv PLC. We do not expect any material changes in operations as a result of the proposed transaction. The transaction is subject to approval by shareholder vote and sanction by the Royal Court of Jersey. There can be no assurance as to when or if the proposed transaction will be completed. 
 Trends, Uncertainties and Opportunities 
 Economic conditions. Our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers. Automotive sales depend on a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions. Global automotive vehicle production increased 9 (10 on an AWM basis) from 2022 to 2023, reflecting increased vehicle production of 13 in Europe, 10 in China, 9 in North America and flat production in South America, our smallest region. Compared to 2023, vehicle production for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2 (down 2 on an AWM basis). 
 On September 15, 2023, several of our largest customers collective bargaining agreements with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (the UAW expired and the UAW subsequently went on strike against General Motors GM ), Ford Motor Company Ford and Stellantis N.V. Stellantis in the United States U.S. ), causing work stoppages at certain of these customers vehicle production and parts distribution facilities, which lasted approximately six weeks. Aptiv s estimated total indirect and direct adverse impacts of these labor strikes to revenue during the second half of 2023 were approximately 180 million. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the risks related to significant disruptions at our or our customers manufacturing facilities. 
 Economic volatility or weakness in North America, Europe, China or, to a lesser extent, South America could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Global inflationary pressures have, at times, both reduced consumer demand for automotive vehicles and increased the price of inputs to our products, which has adversely impacted our profitability, and this trend has continued in 2024. There is also potential that geopolitical factors could adversely impact the U.S. and other economies, and specifically the automotive sector. In particular, changes to international trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement or other political pressures could affect the operations of our OEM customers, resulting in reduced automotive production in certain regions or shifts in the mix of production to higher cost regions. Increases in interest rates could also negatively impact automotive production as a result of increased consumer borrowing costs or reduced credit availability. Additionally, economic weakness may result in shifts in the mix of future automotive sales (from vehicles with more content such as luxury vehicles, trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars). While our diversified customer and geographic revenue base, along with our flexible cost structure, have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns, shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profitability. 
 Ukraine/Russia conflict. The conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which began in February 2022, has had, and is expected to continue to have, negative economic impacts to both countries and to the European and global economies. In response to the conflict, the European Union (the E.U. ), the U.S. and other nations implemented broad economic sanctions against Russia. These countries may impose further sanctions and take other actions as the situation continues. 
 Given the sanctions put in place by the E.U., U.S. and other governments, which restrict our ability to conduct business in Russia, we initiated a plan in the second quarter of 2022 to exit our 51 owned subsidiary in Russia, which was reported within the Signal and Power Solutions segment. On May 30, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its entire interest in the Russian subsidiary to JSC Samara Cables Company, the sole minority shareholder in the Russian subsidiary, for a nominal amount in exchange for all of the Company s shares in the subsidiary. The Company did not record any incremental gain or loss resulting from this disposition. Refer to Note 17. Acquisitions and Divestitures to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for further detail on this transaction. 
 Ukraine and Russia are significant global producers of raw materials used in our supply chain, including copper, aluminum, palladium and neon gases. Disruptions in the supply and volatility in the price of these materials and other inputs produced by Ukraine or Russia, including increased logistics costs and longer transit times, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. The conflict has also increased the possibility of cyberattacks occurring, which could either directly or indirectly impact our operations. Furthermore, the conflict has caused our customers to analyze their continued presence in the region and future customer production plans in the region remain uncertain.

We do not have a material physical presence in either Ukraine or Russia, with less than 1 of our workforce located in the countries as of December 31, 2023 and less than 1 of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 generated from manufacturing facilities in those countries. However, the impacts of the conflict have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, global economies, and in particular, the European economy, a region which accounted for approximately 34 of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We continue to monitor the situation and will seek to minimize its impact to our business, while prioritizing the safety and well-being of our employees located in both countries and our compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the locations where we operate. Any of the impacts mentioned above, among others, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Global supply chain disruptions. Due to various factors that are beyond our control, there have been global supply chain disruptions at times during recent years, including a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage. The semiconductor supply shortage impacted production in automotive and other industries. We, along with most automotive component manufacturers that use semiconductors, have suffered interruptions in our production and were unable to fully meet the vehicle production demands of OEMs at times over the last several years because of events which are outside our control, including but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage, fires in our suppliers facilities, unprecedented weather events and other extraordinary events. Although we work closely with suppliers and customers to minimize any supply disruptions, some of our customers have indicated that they expect us to bear at least some responsibility for their lost production and other costs. While no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of these customer expectations or any other future claims, we do not currently believe a loss is probable. We will continue to actively monitor our global supply chain and will seek to aggressively mitigate and minimize the impact of supply chain disruptions on our business. 
 In addition, we are carrying critical inventory items and key components, and we continue to procure productive, raw material and non-critical inventory components in order to satisfy our customers vehicle production schedules. However, as a result of our customers recent production volatility and cancellations, among other things, our balance of productive, raw and component material inventories has increased substantially from customary levels as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We will continue to actively monitor and manage inventory levels across all inventory types in order to maximize both supply continuity and the efficient use of working capital. 
 Commercializing the high-tech evolution of the automotive industry . The automotive industry is increasingly evolving towards the implementation of software-dependent components and solutions. In particular, the industry is focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies, with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially viable, fully automated driving experience. We expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for long-term growth for our product offerings in this space. We are focused on enabling and delivering end-to-end smart mobility solutions, enabling our customers transition to more electrified, software-defined vehicles, accelerating the commercialization of active safety and autonomous driving technologies and providing enhanced user experience and connected services. 
 As part of our strategy to harness the full potential of connected intelligent systems across industries, strengthen our capabilities in software-defined mobility and to enable advanced smart vehicle architecture changes, we acquired Wind River in December 2022. Wind River is a global leader in delivering software for the intelligent edge for multiple industries, including automotive, by leveraging mixed-criticality software products and solutions enabling customers to develop in the cloud, deploy over the air and run and manage software at the vehicle edge. 
 We are also continuing to develop market-leading automated driving solutions such as automated driving software, key active safety sensing and compute technologies capable of supporting safety-critical applications. We believe we are well-aligned with industry technology trends that will help to support sustainable future growth in this space and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies. 
 In March 2020, we completed a transaction with Hyundai Motor Group Hyundai to form Motional, AD LLC Motional ), a joint venture focused on the design, development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies. Motional began testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and began testing a production-ready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers, meal delivery providers, fleet operators and automotive manufacturers at prototype scale in 2022. In addition, Motional is involved in collaborative arrangements with mobility providers and with cities such as Las Vegas as solutions are developed for the evolving nature of the mobility industry.

Table of Contents 

Although we believe our strategic partnerships have us well-aligned with industry technology mega-trends in these evolving areas, the timeline necessary to produce commercially viable autonomous vehicles has been extended and is still subject to significant uncertainty, which resulted in additional funding requirements for Motional. In April 2024, Aptiv and Hyundai entered into an agreement to restructure Aptiv s ownership interest in Motional and for Hyundai to provide additional funding to Motional, which also eliminated any requirements for additional future funding from Aptiv. These transactions, which were completed in May 2024, resulted in the reduction of our common equity interest from 50 as of December 31, 2023 to approximately 15 as of June 30, 2024. The total gain recorded as a result of these transactions was approximately 641 million (approximately 2.43 per diluted share) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, within income before income taxes and equity losses in the consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Note 21. Investments in Affiliates to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for further information on these transactions. 
 There are many risks associated with these evolving areas, including the high development costs of active safety and autonomous driving technologies, the uncertain timing of customer and consumer adoption of these technologies, increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry and evolving regulations, such as the guidance for automated driving systems published by the U.S. Department of Transportation. While we believe we are well-positioned in these markets, the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us or our partners and ultimately there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to develop these technologies. 
 Key growth markets . There have been periods of increased market volatility and moderation in the level of economic growth in China, which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in China than those previously experienced. Automotive production in China experienced growth of 10 in 2023, which follows growth of 3 in 2022. Despite the market volatility and moderation in the level of economic growth in China, rising income levels in China and other key growth markets are expected to result in stronger growth rates in these markets over the long-term. Our strong global presence, and presence in these markets, has positioned us to experience above-market growth rates over the long-term. We continue to expand our established presence in key growth markets, positioning us to benefit from the expected long-term growth opportunities in these regions. We are capitalizing on our long-standing relationships with the global OEMs and further enhancing our positions with the key growth market OEMs to continue expanding our worldwide leadership. We continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fast-growing automotive markets. We believe that our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the key growth markets. 
 We have a strong local presence in China, including a major manufacturing base and well-established customer relationships. Each of our business segments have operations and sales in China. Our business in China remains sensitive to economic and market conditions that impact automotive sales volumes in China and may be affected if the pace of growth slows as the Chinese market matures or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in China. However, we continue to believe this market will benefit from long-term demand for new vehicles and stringent governmental regulation driving increased vehicle content, including accelerated demand for electrified vehicles. 
 Market driven products . Our product offerings satisfy the OEMs needs to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the mega-trends of Safe, Green and Connected, leading to increased content per vehicle, greater profitability and higher margins. With these offerings, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content and technology related to safety, electrification, high speed data, connectivity to the global information network and automated driving technologies. We are benefiting from the substantial increase in vehicle content, software and electrification that requires a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate, such as automated advanced driver assistance technologies, electrical vehicle monitoring, active safety systems, lane departure warning systems, integrated vehicle cockpit displays, navigation systems and technologies that enable connected infotainment in vehicles. Our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution and/or consumption is key to satisfying the OEMs needs to reduce emissions while continuing to meet consumer demand for increased vehicle content and technology. While we have identified high voltage electrification systems as a key product market, certain of our OEM customers have recently announced delays in their electric vehicle investment strategies amidst reduced expectations for future consumer demand for these products. 
 Global capabilities . Many OEMs are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization, reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. As a result, OEMs are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis, as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations. Suppliers with global scale and strong design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend. Our global footprint enables us to serve the global OEMs on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with key growth market OEMs. This regional model is structured primarily to service the North American market from Mexico, the South American market from Brazil, the European market from Eastern Europe and North Africa and the Asia Pacific market from China, and we have continued to rotate our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations within these regions.

Our operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business globally, including military conflicts in regions in which we operate, changes in laws or regulations governing labor, trade, or other monetary or tax fiscal policy changes, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the OECD Pillar Two Framework (the Framework ), tariffs, quotas, customs and other import or export restrictions or trade barriers. For instance, effective January 1, 2024, the government of Mexico implemented a country-wide statutory minimum wage increase of 20 . Additionally, the government of Mexico has indicated it may implement other labor reforms, such as a bill to shorten the work week from 48 to 40 hours. While management has implemented measures to mitigate the impact of these labor reforms on our cost structure, we cannot predict the ultimate future impact on our business. 
 The outbreak of armed conflicts in the Middle East beginning in October 2023 has created numerous uncertainties, including the risk that the conflicts spread to the broader region, and their impact on the global economy and supply chains. In addition, as described above, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia has also created numerous economic uncertainties, including the potential for further sanctions against Russia, the impact on the global supply chain for raw materials produced in each country, as well as increased logistics costs and transit times, and the actions of automotive OEMs and suppliers as they relate to production plans in each country and within the region. We are also subject to risks associated with actions taken by governmental authorities to impose changes in laws or regulations that restrict certain business operations, trade or travel in response to a pandemic or widespread outbreak of an illness. The impacts of any of these factors mentioned above, among others, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Furthermore, existing free trade laws and regulations, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products, such as China and Mexico, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in October 2022, the U.S. government imposed additional export control restrictions targeting the export, re-export or transfer of, among other products, certain advanced computing semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing items and related technology to China, which could further disrupt supply chains and adversely impact our business. Management continues to monitor the volatile geopolitical environment to identify, quantify and assess proposed or threatened duties, taxes or other business restrictions which could adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 Product development . The automotive technology and components industry is highly competitive and is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. To compete effectively in the automotive technology and components industry, we must be able to develop and launch new products to meet our customers demands in a timely manner. With our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities we are well positioned to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands and consumer preferences for high-technology content in automobiles. 
 OEMs are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs and weight. As a result, suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers (Tier I suppliers) have assumed many of the design, engineering, research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers. Suppliers that can provide fully-engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing. 
 Engineering, design and development . Our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers. We have a team of approximately 22,200 scientists, engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets, located at 11 major technical centers in China, Germany, India, Mexico, Poland, Singapore and the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we invested approximately 1.8 billion (which includes approximately 492 million co-investment by customers and government agencies) in research and development, including engineering, to maintain our portfolio of innovative products, and own/hold approximately 10,000 patents and protective rights. We also encourage open innovation and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry, government agencies and academic institutions. Our technology competencies are recognized by both customers and government agencies, which, as noted above, co-invest in new product development, accelerating the pace of innovation and reducing the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs. 
 In the past, suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering, designing and developing automotive component parts, and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes. Recently, we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes. This trend reduces our economic risk.

Pricing. Cost-cutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing. Our customer supply agreements generally require step-downs in component pricing over the periods of production and OEMs have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive OEMs. Our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions. In addition, during recent years, global economies and our industry were subjected to significant inflationary cost pressures, and these pressures may continue throughout 2024. We continue to work with our customers, both through price recoveries and adjustments as well as future pricing adjustments as contracts renew, to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures on our results of operations. 
 We are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle. As a result, approximately 97 of our hourly workforce is located in best cost countries. Furthermore, we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of contingent workers, which represented approximately 28 of the hourly workforce as of September 30, 2024. However, we will continue to adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint in response to changes in the global and regional automotive markets and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering, as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on reducing our global overhead costs and on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in Europe. As we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies, we continually evaluate opportunities to further refine our cost structure. 
 We have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately 9.7 billion and substantial available liquidity of approximately 3.9 billion as of September 30, 2024, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and available financing under our Revolving Credit Facility and committed European accounts receivable factoring facility, and no significant U.S. defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employer-paid postretirement basic life insurance benefits OPEB liabilities. We intend to maintain strong financial discipline by targeting industry-leading earnings growth, cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle. 
 OEM product recalls . The number of vehicles recalled globally by OEMs has increased above historical levels. These recalls can either be initiated by the OEMs or influenced by regulatory agencies. Although there are differing rules and regulations across countries governing recalls for safety issues, the overall transition towards global vehicle platforms may also contribute to increased recalls outside of the U.S., as automotive components are increasingly standardized across regions. Given the sensitivity to safety issues in the automotive industry, including increased focus from regulators and consumers, we anticipate the number of automotive recalls may remain above historical levels in the near future. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, it is possible that we may be adversely affected in the future if the pace of these recalls continues. 
 Efficient use of capital . The global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs. Lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years. Substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs. 
 Industry consolidation and disruptive new entrants. Consolidation among worldwide OEMs and suppliers is expected to continue as these companies seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies, acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships. Additionally, the rise of advanced software and technologies in vehicles has attracted new and disruptive entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry. These entrants may seek to gain access to certain vehicle technology and component markets. Any of these new competitors may develop and introduce technologies that gain greater customer or consumer acceptance, which could adversely affect the future growth of the Company. We believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of these trends.

Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Aptiv typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in OEM production schedules, vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business (which we refer to collectively as volume), increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs (which we refer to as commodity pass-through), fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which we refer to as FX ), contractual reductions of the sales price to the OEM (which we refer to as contractual price reductions) and engineering changes. Changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue. Such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth, shifts in OEM sales demand, as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration. For instance, a shift in sales demand favoring a particular OEM s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue. A shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions, which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue. 
 We typically experience (as described below) fluctuations in operating income due to: 
 Volume, net of contractual price reductions changes in volume offset by contractual price reductions (which typically range from 1 to 3 of net sales) and changes in mix; 
 Operational performance changes to costs for materials and commodities or manufacturing and engineering variances; and 
 Other including restructuring costs and any remaining variances not included in Volume, net of contractual price reductions or Operational performance. 
 The automotive technology and component supply industry is traditionally subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain. For instance, the industry has recently been subjected to increased pricing pressures, specifically in relation to copper and petroleum-based resin products, which have experienced significant volatility in price. We have also been impacted globally by increased overall inflation as a result of a variety of global trends. Due to various factors, the industry has recently been impacted by increased operating and logistics challenges from certain global supply chain disruptions, including a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage. This shortage has resulted in increased pricing pressures on semiconductors as well. Although the severity of these disruptions abated during the second half of 2023, we expect semiconductor supply cost and commodity cost volatility to have a continual impact on future earnings and/or operating cash flows. As such, we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our material-related cost exposures using a number of approaches, including combining purchase requirements with customers and/or other suppliers, using alternate suppliers or product designs, negotiating cost reductions and/or commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging. We have also negotiated, and will continue to negotiate, price increases with our customers in response to the aforementioned increased overall inflation and global supply chain disruptions.

Our volumes decreased 3 for the period, which primarily reflects volume declines in Europe and North America, with decreased global automotive production of 2 (down 2 on an AWM basis). The decline in volumes were partially offset by impacts of favorable pricing, net of contractual price reductions, of 143 million. In addition, our net sales reflect net unfavorable foreign currency impacts, primarily related to the Chinese Yuan Renminbi, partially offset by impacts related to the Euro. 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales is primarily comprised of material, labor, manufacturing overhead, freight, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, product engineering, design and development expenses, depreciation, warranty costs and other operating expenses. Gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percentage of net sales. 
 Cost of sales decreased 270 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, as summarized below. The Company s material cost of sales was approximately 50 and 55 of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 The Company s tax rate is affected by the fact that its parent entity is an Irish resident taxpayer, the tax rates in Ireland and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction and the relative amount of losses or income for which no tax benefit or expense was recognized due to a valuation allowance. The Company s effective tax rate is also impacted by the receipt of certain tax incentives and holidays that reduce the effective tax rate for certain subsidiaries below the statutory rate. 
 The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes net discrete tax benefits of approximately 45 million and 65 million, respectively, primarily related to changes in valuation allowances and a business reorganization. Also included as a discrete item in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is the beneficial impact of approximately 5 points resulting from the Motional funding and ownership restructuring transactions, as described further in Note 21. Investment in Affiliates to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for additional information. There was no tax expense associated with these gains as Aptiv s interest in Motional is exempt from capital gains tax in the jurisdiction in which it is owned. The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes net discrete tax benefits of approximately 1,386 million and 1,411 million, respectively, primarily related to the Company s actual and anticipated transfers of intellectual property, as described below. 
 On December 15, 2022, the European Union (the E.U. Member States formally adopted the Framework, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 , as established by the OECD. Many countries have enacted legislation consistent with the Framework effective at the beginning of 2024. The OECD continues to release additional guidance on these rules. The Company has proactively responded to these tax policy changes, as described below, and will continue to closely monitor developments. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes an unfavorable impact from the enacted Framework. 
 In response to the Framework, the Company initiated changes to its corporate entity structure, including intercompany transfers of certain intellectual property to one of its subsidiaries in Switzerland, during the second half of 2023. Furthermore, during the third quarter of 2023, the Company s Swiss subsidiary was granted a ten year tax incentive, beginning in 2024. The measurement of certain deferred tax assets and associated income tax benefits resulting from these transactions was impacted by tax legislation in Switzerland enacted in the fourth quarter of 2023, which increased the statutory income tax rate, resulting in additional deferred tax benefit impacts, net of valuation allowances. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 and second half of 2023, the total income tax benefit recorded as a result of the intercompany transfers of intellectual property, all as described above, combined with other related additional tax expense as a result of the transactions, was approximately 1,360 million and 2,080 million, respectively.

 Equity loss, net of tax reflects the Company s interest in the results of ongoing operations of entities accounted for as equity method investments. The decrease in equity losses recognized by Aptiv during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily attributable to the decrease in Aptiv s common equity interest in Motional from 50 to approximately 15 as a result of Motional funding and ownership restructuring transactions that were completed in May 2024. Refer to Note 21. Investments in Affiliates to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for additional information. 

Results of Operations by Segment 
 We operate our core business along the following operating segments, which are grouped on the basis of similar product, market and operating factors: 
 Signal and Power Solutions, which includes complete electrical architecture and component products. 
 Advanced Safety and User Experience, which includes vehicle technology and services in advanced safety, user experience and smart vehicle compute and software, as well as cloud-native software platforms, autonomous driving technologies and DevOps tools. 
 Eliminations and Other, which includes i) the elimination of inter-segment transactions, and ii) certain other expenses and income of a non-operating or strategic nature. 
 Our management utilizes Adjusted Operating Income as the key performance measure of segment income or loss to evaluate segment performance, and for planning and forecasting purposes to allocate resources to the segments, as management believes this measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments. Segment Adjusted Operating Income should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income attributable to Aptiv, which is the most directly comparable financial measure to Adjusted Operating Income that is prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment Adjusted Operating Income, as determined and measured by Aptiv, should also not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Refer to Note 19.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview of Capital Structure 
 Our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations, including capital expenditures and working capital requirements, as well as to fund debt service requirements and operational restructuring activities. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, our existing cash balance, and as necessary and available, borrowings under credit facilities and issuance of long-term debt and equity. To the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness, strategic acquisitions or investments, additional share repurchases and/or general corporate purposes. We also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1.1 billion and net debt (defined as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents) of 8.5 billion. The following table summarizes our available liquidity, which includes cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and funds available under our significant committed credit facilities, as of September 30, 2024: 
 September 30, 2024 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents 1,054 Short-term investments (1) 791 Revolving Credit Facility, unutilized portion (2) 2,000 Committed European accounts receivable factoring facility, unutilized portion (3) 52 Total available liquidity 3,897 
 (1) The Company s Euro-denominated short-term investments, shown based on September 30, 2024 foreign currency rates, are anticipated to be utilized to redeem the 700 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.50 Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes due 2025 prior to their maturity. 
 (2) Availability reduced by less than 1 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 (3) Based on September 30, 2024 foreign currency rates, subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable. 
 
 We expect existing cash, available liquidity and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities, including restructuring payments, capital expenditures and debt obligations. 
 We also continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications, subject to current monetary policies. We utilize a combination of strategies, including dividends, cash pooling arrangements, intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Aptiv. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled approximately 1.0 billion. If additional non-U.S. cash was needed for our U.S. operations, we may be required to accrue and pay withholding if we were to distribute such funds from non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S.;

however, based on our current liquidity needs and strategies, we do not anticipate a need to accrue and pay such additional amounts. 
 Share Repurchase Programs 
 In July 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5.0 billion of ordinary shares, which commenced in August 2024 following completion of the Company s 2.0 billion January 2019 share repurchase program. This share repurchase program provides for share purchases in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions (which may include derivative transactions, including an accelerated share repurchase program ASR )), depending on share price, market conditions and other factors, as determined by the Company. 
 As part of the Company s share repurchase program, on August 1, 2024, the Company entered into ASR agreements with each of Goldman Sachs International and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to repurchase an aggregate of 3.0 billion of Aptiv s ordinary shares (the ASR Agreements ). 
 Under the terms of the ASR Agreements, on August 2, 2024, the Company made an aggregate payment of 3.0 billion (the Repurchase Price and received initial deliveries of approximately 30.8 million ordinary shares with a value of 2.25 billion, which were retired immediately and recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity. Aptiv incurred approximately 4 million of direct costs in connection with the ASR Agreements. Given the Company s ability to settle in shares, as described below, the remaining 750 million prepaid forward contract was classified as a reduction to additional paid-in capital as of September 30, 2024. The Company initially funded the accelerated share repurchase program with cash on hand and borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement. The Bridge Credit Agreement was subsequently repaid and terminated during the three months ended September 30, 2024 using proceeds from the Term Loan A and issuance of the 2024 Senior Notes and 2024 Junior Notes, as further described in Note 8. Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. 
 The total number of shares to be repurchased under each ASR Agreement will be based on the average daily volume-weighted average price of our ordinary shares on specified dates during the term of such ASR Agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreements. 
 Upon final settlement of the ASR Agreements, under certain circumstances, the relevant counterparty may be required to deliver additional ordinary shares, or we may be required to deliver ordinary shares or to make a cash payment to the relevant counterparty, at our election. The final settlements under the ASR Agreements are scheduled to occur no later than the second quarter of 2025, and in each case may be accelerated at the option of the applicable counterparty. 
 A summary of the ordinary shares repurchased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total number of shares repurchased 31,711,240 44,431,332 872,774 Average price paid per share 73.05 75.40 112.03 Total (in millions) 2,316 3,350 98 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 2,515 million of share repurchases remained available under the July 2024 share repurchase program. All previously repurchased shares were retired and are reflected as a reduction of ordinary share capital for the par value of the shares, with the excess applied as reductions to additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings. 
 Dividends from Equity Investments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Aptiv received dividends of 10 million and 5 million, respectively, from its equity method investments. The dividends were recognized as a reduction to the investment and represented a return on investment included in cash flows from operating activities. 
 Acquisitions and Other Transactions 
 H hle On April 3, 2023, Aptiv acquired 100 of the equity interests of H hle Ltd. H hle ), a manufacturer of microducts, for total consideration of 42 million. The results of operations of H hle are reported within the Signal and Power Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. The Company acquired H hle utilizing cash on hand. 
 Sale of Interest in Majority Owned Russian Subsidiary Given the sanctions put in place by the E.U., U.S. and other governments, which restrict our ability to conduct business in Russia, we initiated a plan in the second quarter of 2022 to exit our 51 owned subsidiary in Russia, which was reported within the Signal and Power Solutions segment. On May 30, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its entire interest in the Russian subsidiary to JSC Samara Cables Company, the sole minority shareholder in the Russian subsidiary, for a nominal amount in exchange for all of the Company s shares in the subsidiary. As a result of this transaction, the net assets held for sale of the Russian subsidiary were deconsolidated from the

Company s consolidated financial statements and the Company did not record any incremental gain or loss resulting from this disposition. Furthermore, losses relating to the Russian subsidiary during the held for sale period were de minimis. The former Russian subsidiary is not considered to be a related party of the Company after deconsolidation. 
 Refer to Note 17. Acquisitions and Divestitures to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for further detail of the Company s business acquisitions and divestitures. 
 Motional Joint Venture Funding and Ownership Restructuring Transactions On April 19, 2024, Aptiv and Hyundai Motor Group Hyundai entered into an agreement to restructure Aptiv s ownership interest in Motional and for Hyundai to provide additional funding to Motional, each as described below. Prior to these transactions, Motional was 50 owned by each of Aptiv and Hyundai. 
 As part of the agreement, on May 2, 2024, Hyundai invested 475 million in Motional in exchange for an additional 11.7 common equity interest. Aptiv did not participate in this funding round. This transaction resulted in the dilution of Aptiv s common equity interest in Motional from 50 to approximately 44 , prior to the completion of any further transactions as described below. As these units were issued at a valuation greater than the carrying value of our investment in Motional, the Company recognized a gain of approximately 91 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, within income before income taxes and equity losses in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 Also as part of the agreement, on May 16, 2024, Aptiv sold 11 of its common equity interest in Motional to Hyundai for approximately 448 million of cash consideration. Aptiv also exchanged approximately 21 of its common equity in Motional for a like number of Motional preferred shares. These transactions resulted in the reduction of Aptiv s common equity interest in Motional from approximately 44 to approximately 15 . As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a gain of approximately 550 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, within income before income taxes and equity losses in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 The total gain recorded as a result of the Motional funding and ownership restructuring transactions completed in May 2024, all as described above, was approximately 641 million (approximately 2.43 per diluted share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the carrying values of the Company s common equity and preferred equity investments in Motional were 270 million and 899 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company s common equity investment in Motional was 1,096 million. These investments are recorded within investment in affiliates in the consolidated balance sheets and included in the Advanced Safety and User Experience segment. The Company's preferred equity investment in Motional was initially measured at fair value, and subsequently accounted for under the measurement alternative in accordance with ASC Topic 321, Investments Equity Securities , as it does not have a readily determinable fair value. 
 Technology Investments In September 2024, the Company s Advanced Safety and User Experience segment made an investment totaling approximately 399 million RMB (approximately 57 million, using foreign currency rates on the investment date) in preferred equity of MAXIEYE Automotive Technology (Ningbo) Co., Ltd. Maxieye ), a provider of advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving applications. Due to the Company s redemption rights, the Company s investment in Maxieye is classified as an available-for-sale debt security within other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company also agreed to invest an additional 171 million RMB (approximately 24 million, using September 30, 2024 foreign currency rates) in preferred equity of Maxieye, contingent on the achievement of certain technical milestones and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. 
 In July 2024, the Company s Advanced Safety and User Experience segment made an investment of approximately 33 billion Korean Won KRW (approximately 24 million, using foreign currency rates on the investment date) in convertible redeemable preferred shares of StradVision, Inc. StradVision ), a provider of deep learning-based camera perception software for automotive applications. The Company previously made KRW-denominated investments in StradVision totaling approximately 40 million in the first quarter of 2024 and approximately 44 million in prior years (using foreign currency rates on the date of the respective investments). Due to the Company s redemption rights, the Company s investment in StradVision is classified as an available-for-sale debt security within other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income.

The June 2021 amendment, among other things, (1) refinanced and replaced the term loan A and revolver with a new term loan A with an original maturity in 2026, and a new five-year revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of 2 billion, (2) utilized the Company s existing sustainability-linked metrics and commitments, that, if achieved, would change the facility fee and interest rate margins as described below, and (3) established the leverage ratio maintenance covenant that requires the Company to maintain total net leverage (as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement) of less than 3.5 to 1.0 (or 4.0 to 1.0 for four full fiscal quarters following completion of material acquisitions, as defined in the Credit Agreement) and allowed for dividends and other payments on equity. Effective from the date of the April 2023 amendment, all interest rate benchmarks within the Credit Agreement that were previously based on the London Interbank Offered Rate were transitioned to a rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature that permits Aptiv to increase, from time to time, the aggregate borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional 1 billion upon Aptiv s request, the agreement of the lenders participating in the increase, and the approval of the Administrative Agent. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are prepayable at Aptiv s option without premium or penalty. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Aptiv had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and less than 1 million in letters of credit were issued under the Credit Agreement. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement reduce availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. No amounts were drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at Aptiv s option, at either (a) the Administrative Agent s Alternate Base Rate ABR as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (b) SOFR plus in either case a percentage per annum as set forth in the table below (the Applicable Rate ). The rates under the Credit Agreement on the specified dates are set forth below: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 SOFR plus ABR plus SOFR plus ABR plus Revolving Credit Facility 1.06 0.06 1.06 0.06 
 The Applicable Rate under the Credit Agreement, as well as the facility fee, may increase or decrease from time to time based on changes in the Company s credit ratings and whether the Company achieves or fails to achieve certain sustainability-linked targets with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and workplace safety. Such adjustments may be up to 0.04 per annum on interest rate margins on the Revolving Credit Facility, 0.02 per annum on interest rate margins on the Tranche A Term Loan (prior to its repayment, as described above) and 0.01 per annum on the facility fee. Accordingly, the interest rate is subject to fluctuation during the term of the Credit Agreement based on changes in the ABR, SOFR, changes in the Company s corporate credit ratings or whether the Company achieves or fails to achieve its sustainability-linked targets. The Credit Agreement also requires that Aptiv pay certain facility fees on the Revolving Credit Facility, which are also subject to adjustment based on the sustainability-linked targets as described above, and certain letter of credit issuance and fronting fees. The Company achieved the sustainability-linked targets for the 2023 calendar year, and the interest rate margins and facility fees were reduced from the Applicable Rates, by the amounts specified above, effective in the third quarter of 2024. 
 The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the Company s (and the Company s subsidiaries ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or liens or to dispose of substantially all of its assets. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 3.5 to 1.0 (or 4.0 to 1.0 for four full fiscal quarters following completion of material acquisitions, as defined in the Credit Agreement). 
 The Credit Agreement also contains events of default customary for financings of this type. The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 Term Loan A Credit Agreement 
 On August 19, 2024, Aptiv PLC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries AGF DAC and Aptiv Corporation entered into a new senior unsecured term loan A credit agreement (the Term Loan A Credit Agreement with, among others, JPMorgan Chase

 Proceeds from the Term Loan A were used to repay a portion of the loans incurred under the Bridge Credit Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This transaction was accounted for as a modification of debt in accordance with ASC Topic 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments . Accordingly, a pro-rata portion of the unamortized fees from the Bridge Credit Agreement in the amount of 4 million was transferred to the Term Loan A and, together with the 2 million of direct issuance costs referenced above, will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the Term Loan A. 
 The Term Loan A matures on August 19, 2027. Borrowings under the Term Loan A Credit Agreement are prepayable at Aptiv s option without premium or penalty. No principal payment is required until the outstanding principal amount is due in full on the maturity date. 
 Loans under the Term Loan A Credit Agreement bear interest, at Aptiv s option, at either (a) ABR or (b) SOFR plus in either case a percentage per annum as set forth in the table below (the Term Loan Applicable Rate ). The rates under the Term Loan A Credit Agreement on the specified dates are set forth below: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 SOFR plus ABR plus SOFR plus ABR plus Term Loan A 1.25 0.25 N/A N/A 
 The Term Loan Applicable Rate under the Term Loan A Credit Agreement may increase or decrease from time to time based on changes in the Company s credit ratings. The interest rate is subject to fluctuation during the term of the Term Loan A Credit Agreement based on changes in the ABR, SOFR or changes in the Company s corporate credit ratings. 
 The interest rate period with respect to SOFR interest rate options can be set at one-, three-, or six-months as selected by Aptiv in accordance with the terms of the Term Loan A Credit Agreement (or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders). Aptiv may elect to change the selected interest rate option in accordance with the provisions of the Term Loan A Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, Aptiv selected the one-month SOFR interest rate option on the Term Loan A, and the rate effective as of September 30, 2024, as detailed in the table below, was based on the Company s current credit rating and the Term Loan Applicable Rate for the Term Loan A Credit Agreement: Borrowings as of Term Loan September 30, 2024 Rates effective as of Applicable Rate (in millions) September 30, 2024 Term Loan A SOFR plus 1.25 600 6.315 
 The Term Loan A Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the Company s (and the Company s subsidiaries ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or liens or to dispose of substantially all of its assets. In addition, the Term Loan A Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Term Loan A Credit Agreement) of not more than 3.5 to 1.0 (or 4.0 to 1.0 for four full fiscal quarters following completion of material acquisitions, as defined in the Term Loan A Credit Agreement).

After expiration of the new three-year term, either party can terminate with three months notice.

Our cash balance typically peaks at month end.

 Performance Metrics and Formula Used to Determine 
 the Number of Earned Performance-Based RSU Shares 
 
 Metric 1 Return on Net Assets RONA 
 Definition Tax-affected operating income, divided by average net working capital plus average net property, plant and equipment, including adjustments for significant items not originally contemplated in establishing the target, as permitted by the Plan, measured each calendar year. Final performance will be based upon the three-year average of calendar year RONA for , and .

 If the final RONA is below the minimum RONA, no RONA performance will be considered. 
 If the final RONA is above the maximum RONA, the maximum RONA performance will be earned (200 ). 
 If the final average RONA is between the minimum and target levels, between the target and BBP levels or between the BBP and maximum levels, the percentage of the performance-based payout formula earned will be determined by linear interpolation between the relevant payout percentages identified above, rounded to the nearest whole percentage point. 
 
 Metric 2 Cumulative Net Income NI 
 Definition Cumulative adjusted net income attributable to Aptiv, including adjustments for significant items not originally contemplated in establishing the target, as permitted by the Plan, for the performance period through .

If the final cumulative NI performance is between the minimum and target levels, between the target and BBP levels or between the BBP and maximum levels, the percentage of the performance-based payout formula earned will be determined by linear interpolation between the relevant payout percentages identified above, rounded to the nearest whole percentage point. 
 
 Metric 3 Relative Total Shareholder Return TSR 
 Definition The stock price appreciation, expressed as a percentage with one decimal point, assuming dividends are reinvested in company stock on the dividend payment date during the Performance Period. To obtain relative TSR, the Company s TSR is compared against the TSR of the companies included in the Russell 3000 Auto Parts Index, as listed on the following page. For purposes of the TSR calculation, the beginning stock price shall be the average closing sales prices of each company s common stock for all available trading days in and the ending stock price shall be the average closing sales prices of each company s common stock for all available trading days in .

 If the final TSR is at or above the th percentile, the maximum TSR performance will be earned (200 ). 
 Fractional percentiles will be rounded using conventional rounding methods. 
 In determining the Company s percentile rank, the companies included in the Russell 3000 Auto Parts Index shall be used. If the common stock of any of these companies is not publicly traded throughout the Performance Period, such company s results will be excluded from the calculation of the Company s relative performance. 
 
 Total Earned Performance-Based RSU Shares 
 The total performance payout percentage and the number of Earned Performance-Based RSUs will be determined by 
 (1) Multiplying the weight of the performance factor by the calculated payout percentage 
 (a) 33.3 multiplied by the RONA payout percentage, 
 (b) 33.3 multiplied by the NI payout percentage, and 
 (c) 33.3 multiplied by the TSR payout percentage 
 (2) Adding the three weighted components to derive the final combined payout percentage, rounding to the nearest whole percentage and 
 (3) Multiplying the final combined payout percentage by the number of Performance-Based RSUs granted.
