A
ROU asset is subject to the same impairment guidance as assets categorized as property and equipment. As such, any impairment loss on
ROU assets is presented in the same manner as an impairment loss recognized on other long-lived assets. 

A
lease modification is a change to the terms and conditions of a contract that changes the scope or consideration of a lease. For example,
a change to the terms and conditions to the contract that adds or terminates the right to use one or more underlying assets, or extends
or shortens the contractual lease term, is a modification. Depending on facts and circumstances, a lease modification may be accounted
for as either: (1) the original lease plus the lease of a separate asset(s) or (2) a modified lease. A lease will be remeasured if there
are changes to the lease contract that do not give rise to a separate lease. 

Revenue
Recognition for Golf Simulators. Revenues from the sale of golf simulators are recognized with the selling price to the customer
recorded as revenues and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of revenues. We recognize revenue from these transactions
when control has passed to the customer and the performance obligations have been satisfied. Control is considered to have passed to
the customer when the simulators has been delivered, installed and accepted by the customer. Golf simulators are bundled and are comprised
of both hardware and a software license (for the software to operate the simulator). Our simulator contracts with customers generally
do not include multiple performance obligations. 

Revenue
Recognition for Content Software Subscriptions . The Company offers content software subscriptions for one and twelve months. We recognize
revenue from these transactions when control has passed to the customer and the performance obligations have been satisfied. Control
is considered to have passed to the customer when the software license has been delivered and accepted by the customer. The content software
subscription revenue is recognized over the term of the contract.

On June 1, 2017, the royalty percentage was changed to based on the trailing 12-month revenues at that time as outlined in the table
above. 

The
Agreement contains an option for a one-time buy down of the royalty rate. At any time following the date on which the Purchaser has received
royalty payments that are, in the aggregate, equal to two times the then applicable Aggregate Installment Amount ), we may
purchase and extinguish (but no more nor less) of all amounts owing or to become owing to the Purchaser hereunder. In the event we

i. 
 An
 amount equal to two times the aggregate installment amount as at the date of the change of control buyout notice; and

c. 
 C

 or substantially all of the Company s assets. 

The
Agreement has neither a stated maturity nor an interest rate. While the royalty percentage can be reduced via a buydown, as previously
explained, the only avenue for terminating the Agreement is a buyout required by an acquirer in a change of control transaction. Absent
the change of control, the Agreement will survive in perpetuity at a royalty rate of or depending on whether or not the royalty
rate buydown option has been exercised. 

Because
the gross sales royalty payable has no stated fixed interest nor maturity, it is considered variable interest perpetual debt. The periodic
variable payments to the Purchaser are recorded in interest expense. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding
amount was . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred and , respectively, in interest expense

Company
Overview 

Since
1983, TruGolf has been passionate about driving the golf industry with innovative, indoor golf solutions. We build products that capture
the spirit of golf. Our mission is to help grow the game by making it more available, more approachable and more affordable, through
technology because we believe golf is for everyone. 

Our
team has built award-winning video games (including Links , a popular sports game for PC), innovative hardware solutions, and an
all-new e-sports platform to connect golfers around the world with TruGolf E6 Connect Software, our premier software engine. Since TruGolf s
beginning, we have continued to define and redefine what is possible with golf technology. 

In
addition to offering a variety of custom, professional, and portable golf simulators, TruGolf s latest launch monitor, Apogee,
was created to improve accuracy and to make using the launch monitor easier. Features of Apogee include: a unique Apogee Voice Assistant,
a voice command system that allows users to navigate their TruGolf E6 Connect Software gameplay within rounds and practice sessions;
Laser Launchpad, a laser indicator that shows users where to place the ball and when the system is ready to record a swing and Point-of-Impact
(POI) slow-motion replay video. 

Our
suite of hardware offerings in the golf technology space is expansive, offering something for virtually everyone from gamers to beginners
to professionals, and all consumers in between. Hardware offerings are sold through a global network of authorized resellers, retail
outlets and direct-to-consumer through a dedicated TruGolf sales team. Our suite of hardware offerings ranges from entry level pricing
at just under 400, to well over 100,000 for custom projects, creating a wide range of pricing options for nearly all consumers, and
providing TruGolf with a competitive advantage in creating a wide consumer base as compared to its competitors (who often only focus
in a narrow consumer price range). 

TruGolf
creates top golf technology software in the marketplace through its TruGolf E6 Connect Software. Importantly, TruGolf E6 Connect Software
is designed not only for use with our suite of hardware offerings in the golf technology space, but also integrates with more than twenty-four
third party golf technology hardware manufacturers, translating to a market integration coverage equal to roughly 90 of golf technology
hardware in the global market space, which allows peer-to-peer play across these golf technology hardware manufacturers, allowing for
a unification of the golf technology space. TruGolf E6 Connect Software records, on average, over 725,000 indoor golf shots per day.
TruGolf E6 Connect Software is both PC and iOS compatible and can be used both indoors and outdoors. 

TruGolf
has leveraged its unique position as one of the industry leaders in both hardware and software golf technology solutions to organize
and found the Virtual Golf Association (VGA). The VGA is a gamified virtual economy that takes place inside the TruGolf E6 Connect Software.
Users have a chance to earn points through play, practice, and more providing a worldwide leaderboard of connected indoor golfers.
Each shot users take rewards them with points. These points can be used to purchase in-game enhancements, or to enter virtual golf tournaments
with real world prizes. The VGA is broken into three models: 

Game
 Analysis rewards TruGolf E6 Connect Software users who track and measure their game. Users can set specific goals (e.g.,
 shots hit per month, speed and distance gains, dispersion reduction) and earn points for hitting milestones. At the end of each month,
 users can see how they compared against all other users utilizing the Game Analysis features. 

29 

Connected
 Golf rewards users for joining with their friends and playing golf online. Earn points for playing a new course or linking
 up to play nine holes with another player utilizing TruGolf E6 Connect Software. 

Virtual
 Golf Association Events events are worldwide leaderboard format, flighted by handicap, where users play and compete to shoot
 the lowest score. These contests include stroke play, closest to the pin, match play, stableford, and more. Users earn points based
 on how they finish in their division. 

In
totality, TruGolf s business model is designed to be positioned as the hub of golf technology, with groundbreaking hardware technologies
that we believe can become the industry standard and unifying the industry as a whole by serving as the leader of golf technology software
solutions through its TruGolf E6 Connect Software.

Business
Combination

January 31, 2024, the Company consummated the business combination (the Closing contemplated by the previously announced
Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 21, 2023 (as amended, the Merger Agreement ), by and
among the Company, DMAC Merger Sub Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ),
Bright Vision Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in the capacity as the Purchaser Representative thereunder, Christopher

stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Market LLC under the ticker symbol TRUG on February 1, 2024. 

Accounting
for the Business Combination 

The
Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, DMAQ was treated
as the acquired company for accounting purposes, whereas TruGolf Nevada was treated as the accounting acquirer. In accordance with this
method of accounting, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of TruGolf Nevada issuing shares for the net assets of DMAQ,
accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of DMAQ and TruGolf Nevada were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other
intangible assets recorded, and operations prior to the Business Combination were those of TruGolf Nevada. TruGolf Nevada has been determined
to be the accounting acquirer for purposes of the Business Combination based on an evaluation of the following facts and circumstances: 

Legacy
 TruGolf Nevada stockholders have a majority of the voting power of New TruGolf, 

TruGolf
 Nevada comprising the ongoing operations of New TruGolf,

TruGolf
Links Franchising, LLC 

On
May 10, 2024 the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary in the state of Delaware. TruGolf Links Franchising, LLC Links has a sole member, TruGolf, Inc. Links was formed to establish and sell franchises that would use the Company s indoor golf and
recreational sports simulators and other equipment. Links offers a Service Area franchise agreement for a single location. It also offers
a regional developer franchise agreement that allows the franchisee to sell franchises within its region. The upfront fees range from
 45,000 to 100,000. Links has received proceeds of 500,000 from its CEO and 75,000 from a third party to purchase the franchise rights
to some regions yet to be determined. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 575,000 of deferred revenue and incurred 306,539
of expenses that are included in the Selling, general and administrative category. 

Capitalized
software development cost 

We
capitalize certain costs related to the development of our software used in our simulators. In accordance with authoritative guidance,
including ASC 985-20, Software-Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed , we began to capitalize these costs when the technological
feasibility was established and preliminary development efforts were successfully completed, management authorized and committed project
funding, and it was probable that the project would be completed and the software would be used as intended. Such costs are amortized
when placed in service, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, estimated to be three years beginning
on February 1, 2024. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria together with costs incurred for training and maintenance are expensed
as incurred and recorded in product development expenses on our statements of operations. The Company does not capitalize any testing
or maintenance costs. The accounting for these capitalized software costs requires us to make significant judgments, assumptions and
estimates related to the timing and amount of recognized capitalized software development costs. For the nine months ended September
30, 2024 we capitalized 1,967,418 of costs related to the development of software applications. Amortization of capitalized software
costs was 279,001 for the for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The balance of capitalized software was 1,738,417 net of accumulated
amortization of 279,001 at September 30, 2024. 

Ethos
Management INC 

The
Ethos Asset Management Loan Agreement Loan Agreement stipulates that fundings should happen approximately every 30 banking
days, subject to Ethos completing periodic internal audits to ensure the Company was in compliance with the terms of loan agreement.
Ethos Management informed the Company in August 2023, that unrelated to TruGolf, Ethos Management is currently undergoing a routine audit
of its loan portfolio, and pending the close of the audit, borrowers may experience delays in drawing on funds when requested. Due to
the lack of additional fundings and in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement, in February 2024, we sent Ethos a notice of termination
for materially breaching the Loan Agreement. Based on the termination for default clause in the Loan Agreement, we are entitled to retain
all the funds disbursed by Ethos and Ethos must release the deposit collateral. The Company has recorded a liability of 589,619 as of
September 30, 2024 which is the amount remaining after applying the security collateral of 1,875,000 against the loan payable and accrued
interest.

Industry
Update 

We
note that the simulator/screen golf market is growing according to the National Golf Foundation (www.ngf.org/simulator-golf-sees-real-surge),
 An estimated 6.2 million Americans hit golf balls with a club in a golf simulator within the past year, a total that surged 73 
compared to pre-pandemic levels. Golf s continued evolution includes many new forms of the game and simulated golf is a part of
it. Based on the growing golf simulator industry trend, we continue to believe there is a strong demand for our new hardware and
software products. Based on the growing industry golf simulator trend noted above, we continue to believe there is a strong demand for
our new hardware and software products. 

According
to recently released data from The National Golf Foundation, 45 million Americans aged 6 and above played golf in 2023. This record-setting
total includes 32.9 million people who played off-course golf, with 18.4 million of them who participated exclusively in off-course golf
activities at places such as driving ranges, indoor golf simulators, or golf entertainment venues. Only 12.1 million played exclusively
on-course, furthering the trend. 

Principal
External Factors Affecting Our Operating Results 

We
believe that our performance and future success depend on many factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks
and challenges, including those discussed below and in the section entitled Risk Factors . 

Market
 acceptance . The growth of our business depends on our ability to gain broader acceptance of our current products by continuing
 to make users aware of the significant benefits of our products to generate increased demand and frequency of use, and thus increase
 our sales. Our ability to grow our business will also depend on our ability to expand our customer base in existing or new target
 markets, including international markets. Although we have increased the number of users of TruGolf hardware and software product
 offerings and continue to grow our channels globally through established relationships and focused sales efforts, we cannot provide
 assurance that our efforts will continue to increase the use of our products. 

Sales
 force size and effectiveness. The rate at which we grow our sales force and expansion channels and the speed at which newly hired
 salespeople and sales channels become effective can impact our revenue growth and our costs incurred in anticipation of such growth.
 We intend to continue to make significant investments in our sales and marketing organization and channels by increasing the number
 of sales representatives and expanding our international programs to help facilitate further adoption of our products as well as
 broaden awareness of our products to new customers. We are slowly expanding into EMEA through a quickly growing network of distributors
 that will each slowly develop their respective territories, sales from EMEA are still below 5 of total sales. We have also signed
 a Joint Venture agreement with a partner in China to manage all distribution needs across Asia. We are not required to invest in
 any of these markets, and as such take a lower margin on products sold there, therefore we expect slowly growing impacts on top line
 revenue from these globalization efforts. 

Product
 and geographic mix; timing. Our financial results, including our gross margins, may fluctuate from period to period based on
 the timing of orders, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the number of available selling days in a particular period,
 which can be impacted by a number of factors, such as holidays or days of severe inclement weather in a particular geography, the
 mix of products sold and the geographic mix of where products are sold. 

Principal
Components of Revenues, Costs and Expenses 

Revenues 

Our
revenues come from the sale of TruGolf software and hardware, which products are sold through a global network of authorized resellers,
retail outlets and direct-to-consumer through a dedicated TruGolf sales team. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues consists primarily of costs that are directly related to the delivery of our TruGolf hardware and software products, excluding
depreciation but including direct material, labor, manufacturing overhead, reserves for estimated warranty costs and charges to write-down
the inventory carrying value when it exceeds the estimated net realizable value. 

32 

Operating
Expenses 

Royalties 

We
have agreements with certain software golf hardware vendors who bundle our tracking and golf course software with their hardware. We
pay them a royalty based on the number of units or subscriptions they sell. The royalty percentages typically range between 20 to 30 .
The royalty agreements are for one year, with automatic renewal unless each party gives a thirty-day written notice of the intent to
cancel the contract prior to the renewal date. 

Salaries,
Wages and Benefits 

Salaries,
wages and benefits are expenses earned by our employees in the executive, information technology, finance and accounting, human resources,
administrative functions and outside contractors. Also included in salaries, wages and benefits are employer payroll taxes, health, dental
and life insurance expenses. 

Selling,
General and Administrative 

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising, training events, brand building, product marketing activities and installation
and shipping costs. We expect sales and marketing costs will continue to increase as we expand our international selling and marketing
activities, hire additional personnel, and build brand awareness through advertising and training. 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional fees paid for legal, accounting, auditing, and consulting services, bad
debt, licenses and association dues, facilities (including rent and utilities) bank and credit card processing fees and other expenses
related to general and administrative activities. 

We
anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we continue hiring to support our growth. We also
anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, and investor and public relations expenses
associated with operating as a public registrant. 

Other
Expense 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense consists of interest expenses associated with issuing notes and balances outstanding under our debt obligations and the gross
sales royalty payable, the amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discounts associated with such borrowings. 

Principal
Cash Flows 

We
generate cash primarily from our operating activities and, historically, we have used cash flows from operating activities and available
borrowings under certain notes payable as the primary sources of funds to purchase inventory and to fund working capital and capital
expenditures, growth and expansion opportunities (see also Liquidity and Capital Resources below). The management of our
working capital is closely tied to operating cash flows, as working capital can be impacted by, among other things, our accounts receivable
activities, the level of inventories, which may increase or decrease in response to current and expected demand, and the size and timing
of our trade accounts payable payment cycles. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

We
prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The application
of many accounting principles requires us to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses in our financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other
assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often
subjective and they and our actual results may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are
ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts
first become known. We believe the following critical accounting estimates could potentially produce materially different results if
we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. See also Note 2 for a summary of our significant accounting policies. 

33 

Accounts
Receivable, net 

We
manage credit risk associated with our accounts receivable at the customer level. 

We
believe the concentration of credit risk, with respect to our receivables, is limited because our customer base is comprised of a number
of geographically diverse customers. We manage credit risk through credit approvals and other monitoring procedures. 

Our
allowance is estimated using a loss rate model based on delinquency. The estimated loss rate is based on our historical experience with
specific customers, our understanding of our current economic circumstances, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and our own judgment
as to the likelihood of ultimate payment based upon available data. The actual rate of future credit losses, however, may not be similar
to past experience. Our estimate of doubtful accounts could change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy
or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance for
doubtful accounts. 

Inventory,
net 

All
of our inventory consists of raw materials and are valued at the lower of historic cost or net realizable value; where net realizable
value is considered to be the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion,
disposal and transportation. Historic inventory costs are calculated on an average or specific cost basis. The Company records inventory
write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions on current and future demand forecasts. 

Warrants 

The
fair value of the warrants is estimated on the date of issuance using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input
of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the warrants, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividends. These
estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment. Expected volatilities used in the valuation
model are based on the average volatility of the comparable companies publicly traded on recognized stock exchanges. The risk-free rate
for the expected term of the option is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.

Revenues 

Our
revenues were 6,236,795 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,431,735 for the three months ended September 30,
2023, an increase of 2,805,060 or 81.74 . The increase in revenues was due primarily to the increase of our product acceptance and greater
penetration in the industry market. 

34 

Cost
of Revenues 

The
cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 390,402 or 25.46 to 1,924,093 from 1,533,691 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to the increase in revenues as noted above. The Company s adjustment
to inventory included in the cost of revenue, resulted in a reduction of costs of 115,692 and charged cost of revenues 267,224 during
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Materials and components to manufacture our simulators primarily include
fabricated steel, cut cloth, turf, computers, cameras and other high-end electronics which are subject to inflationary pricing pressures.
The cost of shipping our finished simulators increased 36,741 to 163,232 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the same period in 2023 due to price increases from our national shipping companies UPS, FedEx and Seko. We are continuously working
with our suppliers for volume pricing discounts and extended contract terms. 

Operating
Expenses 

Our
operating expenses were 3,440,421 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4,221,755 for the three months ended September
30, 2023, a decrease of 781,334 or (18.51) . The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to: 

i. 
 An
 increase of 36,021 in royalty expenses was due to the addition of new distributors and increases in the royalty percentages for
 certain resellers. 

ii. 
 A
 557,170 decrease in salaries, wages and benefits expenses. The three-month period year over year decrease is a result of the Company s
 human resource management efforts to reduce payroll expenses. 

iii. 
 A
 260,185 decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. The three months over the prior year s three months decrease
 is a result of sales and marketing expenses decreasing by 323,604 and bad debt expense decreasing by 450,000. During the same periods,
 rent and facility costs increased by 23,917, insurance expenses increased by 169,126 (principally for liability insurance), professional
 fees increased by 63,963 (of which 148,438 was incurred by Links) and subscription software expense increased by 128,092. Other
 general and administrative expenses increased by 128,321. 

Interest
Income 

Our
interest income was 38,592 and 21,197 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Interest
Expense 

Our
interest expense was 971,048 and 358,354 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 612,694
or 170.97 primarily due to the interest incurred on the PIPE convertible notes.

2023, an increase of 1,333,280 or 9.67 . The increase in revenues was due primarily to the increase of our product acceptance and greater
penetration in the industry market. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 651,899 or 14.39 to 5,183,328 from 4,531,429 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in revenues as discussed above. The inventory adjustment included
in the cost of revenues increased by 88,786 from 35,105 to 123,891 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Materials and components to manufacture our simulators primarily include fabricated steel, cut cloth, turf, computers, cameras and other
high-end electronics which are subject to inflationary pricing pressures. The cost of shipping our finished simulators increased 304,505
due to price increases from our national shipping companies UPS, FedEx and Seko. We are continuously working with our suppliers for volume

Operating
Expenses 

Our
operating expenses were 10,795,100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16,074,927 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, a decrease of 5,279,827 or (32.85 ). The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to: 

i. 
 An
 increase of 272,302 in royalty expenses was due to the addition of new distributors and increases in the royalty percentages for
 certain resellers. 

ii. 
 A
 1,517,318 decrease in salaries, wages and benefits expenses due primarily to management s efforts to reduce payroll expenses.

iii. 
 A
 4,034,811 decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. The nine months over the prior year s nine months decrease
 is a result of: 

1. 
 In
 March 2023, the Board of Directors granting and authorizing the issuance 821 shares of common stock two consultants (and holders
 of the convertible notes described in Note 12 Convertible Noted Payable in our annual audited financial statements included
 elsewhere in this Form 8K) in March 2023 for consulting service performed. The Company recorded consulting fee expense (noncash)
 of 4,493,333 (estimated fair value of the stock) at the time of grant and issuance. 

2. 
 Selling,
 general and administrative expenses (such as facilities professional fees, warehouse, travel, office supplies etc.) increased 360,173
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of amortization of
 capitalized software costs of 279,001, an increase in professional fees of 639,941 (of which 306,539 was incurred by Links), an
 increase in insurance expense of 428,627, an increase of facility expense of 153,400, an increase in software subscriptions and
 other subscriptions expense of 379,973, an increase in bank charges of 28,093, offset in part by a decrease in sales and marketing
 of 528,711, a decrease in bad debt expense of 657,271 and a decrease in general and administrative expenses of 362,880. 

Interest
Income 

Our
interest income was 105,800 and 71,542 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Interest
Expense 

Our
interest expense was 2,176,810 and 1,265,775 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 911,035
or 71.97 primarily due to the interest on the PIPE convertible notes.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Business
Combination 

The
Company consummated the business combination described in Note 1 and Note 2 on January 31, 2024. The Company received proceeds of approximately
 2,237,213, net of closing costs, expenses and commissions. The Company recorded a PIPE Convertible Note, the source of the proceeds
from the business combination, of 4,650,000 with an original issue discount of 465,000 (or 10 ). 

The
Company received proceeds of 575,000 from the agreements for franchise regions sold by its wholly owned subsidiary, TruGolf Links Franchising,
LLC, which was recorded as deferred revenue. The Company expects to grow this revenue stream in subsequent quarters. 

We
have primarily obtained cash to fund our operations through the reinvestment of free cash flows generated from our business operations,
issuance of common stock to private friend and family investors, issuance of term loans, issuance of notes payable and convertible debt
instruments, and royalty structures. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 7,452,185 and 5,397,564 in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and current
working capital deficit of 1,736,0636 and working capital of 1,988,267, respectively. 

In
December 2023, we entered into a 2,000,000 variable rate line of credit with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. The purpose of the new line
of credit was to consolidate the balances outstanding on the note payable and the previous line of credit, which had matured. The line
of credit matures on December 31, 2024. The line of credit has an annual interest rate computed at the Adjusted SOFR (Secured Overnight
Financing Rate) Rate and at a rate of 3.00 above the SOFR Rate. The Adjusted SOFR rate means the sum of the Applicable margin (3.50 
per annum) plus the SOFR rate applicable to the interest period plus the Unsecured to Secured Rate Adjustment. The majority of the variable
rate line of credit was paid during the three months ended June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining balance was 10,114
and was included in the cash balance. 

Cash
Flow from Operating Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the net cash provided by our operating activities was 3,071,781 including the liquidation of
the marketable securities account of 2,478,953. The change in the remaining operating assets and liabilities was 2,550,049, depreciation
and amortization of 331,728, the amortization of the ROU asset of 251,612 and the amortization of original issue discount of 47,447. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the net cash used in our operating activities was 6,121,139. The change in operating assets
and liabilities was a decrease of 3,714,981. Other assets increased due to the 1,875,000 deposit paid for the Ethos Management Inc
loan and 116,040 in Ethos Management Inc deferred loan fees. The net loss of 8,011,889 was partially offset by increases to cash from
depreciation and amortization of 45,682, amortization of convertible notes original issue discount of 183,695, amortization of ROU
asset of 217,101, bad debt expense of 665,920 and stock-based compensation expense of 4,493,333. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the cash used by our investing activities was 1,967,533 and 2,508,749, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company capitalized software development costs of 1,967,418. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 the Company purchased fixed assets of 89,024 and purchased short-term investments of 2,419,725. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

The
Company consummated the business combination described in Note 1 and Note 2 on January 31, 2024. The Company received proceeds of approximately
 2,325,315, net of closing costs, expenses and commissions. The Company recorded a PIPE Convertible Note, the source of the proceeds
from the business combination, of 4,650,000 less an original issue discount of 465,000 (or 10 ). 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the cash provided by our financing activities was 950,373. The Company received net proceeds
from the Merger of 2,325,315, made debt payments of 294,005, paid 15,716 of assumed liabilities, paid 100,000 on a loan assumed in
the Merger, and paid off the line of credit of 1,980,937. The Company received proceeds of 1,000,000 from the Company s chief
executive officer. 

37 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we borrowed 1,945,397 on our Morgan Stanely margin line of credit account, received proceeds
of 2,499,999 from loans, received 185,500 from convertible note holders and made debt payments of 107,837. One shareholder returned
 75,096 in overpaid past dividends. The loan proceeds were used for ongoing operations. 

The
Company has incurred net losses and negative operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As the Company
continues to incur losses, successful transition to profitability is dependent on achieving a level of revenues adequate to support the
Company s cost structure. Unless and until this occurs, the Company may need to raise capital or issue debt to support ongoing
operations. 

The
Company s financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of obligations in the normal course of business. Continuation as a going concern is dependent upon continued operations of the Company,
which in turn is dependent upon the Company s ability to meet its financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success
of its future operations. 

Under
the rules of ASC Subtopic 205-40 Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern ASC 205-40 ), the Company
is required to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about its ability to meet its future financial obligations
as they become due within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued or available to be issued. This evaluation
considers a Company s current available cash and projected cash needs over the one-year evaluation period but may not consider
things beyond its control. 

The
Company believes the recent merger, as described in Note 1 and Note 2, may enable us to raise additional capital through equity offerings
and not incur more debt or loans payable. 

Our
significant projected cash requirements related primarily to operating expenses for the next 12 months include 7,000,000 to 8,000,000
for employees salaries, wages and benefits, 950,000 to 1,200,000 for installation and customers service, and 1,000,000 to 1,200,000
for development of software and hardware. No assurances can be given that the results anticipated by our projections will occur. With
respect to long-term liquidity requirements, approximately 12,400,000 of our debt contractually matures in the years 2025 to 2033. 

In
the event the projected results do not occur, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization
of one or more product offerings and other strategic initiatives. Additionally, we would reduce the number of new hires planned during
the remaining months of 2024, and implement cost reduction measures such as a reduction in headcount, reducing the planned sales and
marketing expense among other cost reduction measures. We may also issue common stock to potential investors to increase our liquidity. 

Management
believes the plan outlined above provides an opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. 

Material
Cash Requirements for Known Contractual and Other Obligations 

We
have entered into operating leases for our corporate headquarters and a warehouse in Centerville, Utah. The leases have varying terms
expiring between 2023 and 2025. In June 2023, we entered into a sixty-month, triple net lease for additional warehouse space in North
Salt Lake, Utah. The lease payments range between 10,457 and 11,770. 

We
enter into agreements in the normal course of business with various vendors, which are generally cancellable upon notice. Payments due
upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancellable obligations of service
providers, up to the date of cancellation. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Management
has evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and determined that none of the
pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial statements. We will continue to monitor the issuance of any new accounting
pronouncements and assess their potential impact on the financial statements in future periods. 

38 

Emerging
Growth Company 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised
accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period
for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the
earlier of the date that (i) we are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended
transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with
new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We may choose to early adopt any new or revised accounting
standards whenever such early adoption is permitted for private companies. 

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Interest
Rate Risk 

We
had cash and cash equivalents totaling 7,452,185 as of September 30, 2024. Cash equivalents were invested primarily in low interest
checking or savings accounts. Our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity needs. Under
our investment policy, we will only invest in highly rated securities, issued by the U.S. government or liquid money market funds. We
do not invest in financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. We may utilize
external investment managers who adhere to the guidelines of our investment policy. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would
not have a material impact on the value of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, net loss or cash flows. 

We
do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk as only our lines of credit are variable rate. As of September 30, 2024, the variable
rate lines of credit had a balance outstanding of 802,738 compared to the total fixed rate debt outstanding of 14,509,137. Thus, management
believes a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material impact on annualized interest expenses. 

We
maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed any applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance limits. As of September 30, 2024, the amount exceeding the federally insured limits was 6,125,053. 

Cybersecurity
Risk 

We
have completed an assessment of our suite of controls including technology hardware and software solutions, regular testing of the resiliency
of our systems including penetration and disaster recovery testing as well as regular training sessions on cybersecurity risks and mitigation
strategies and have engaged a third party to bring us up to industry best practices. We have established an incident response plan and
team to take steps it determines are appropriate to contain, mitigate and remediate a cybersecurity incident and to respond to the associated
business, legal and reputational risks. There is no assurance that these efforts will fully mitigate cybersecurity risk and mitigation
efforts are not an assurance that no cybersecurity incidents will occur and have had no such breaches of security. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 

Not
applicable as we are a smaller reporting company. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our filings under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms and that material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer (CEO), who is our principal executive officer, and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), who is our principal financial and
accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our CEO and CFO have evaluated these disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and have determined that such disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the material weaknesses discussed below. 

39 

Notwithstanding
the conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report, we
believe that our consolidated financial statements and other information contained in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q present fairly,
in all material respects, our business, financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. 

In
connection with the preparation of our financial statements as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we identified
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we are currently working to remediate, which relate to: (a)
insufficient segregation of duties in the financial statement close process; (b) a lack of sufficient levels of staff with public company
and technical accounting experience to maintain proper control activities and perform risk assessment and monitoring activities; and
(c) insufficient information systems controls, including access and change management controls. We have concluded that these material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting occurred because we did not have the necessary business processes, personnel
and related internal controls to operate in a manner to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting timeline requirements of a public
company. 

In
making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (issued in 2013). 

We
are focused on designing and implementing effective internal control measures to improve our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures,
including internal control over financial reporting, and remediating the material weaknesses. In order to remediate these material weaknesses,
we have taken and plan to take the following actions: 

The
 hiring and planned continued hiring of additional accounting staff with public company experience; 

Implementation
 of new enterprise resource planning system to replace the prior enterprise resource planning system; 

Implementation
 of additional review controls and processes requiring timely account reconciliation and analyses of certain transactions and accounts,
 and 

The
 planned hiring of a national accounting firm to assist in the design and implementation of controls and remediation of control gaps. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15-d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We
are not currently a party to any lawsuit or proceeding which, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect
on us or our business. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors set forth below and discussed in
the section entitled Risk Factors in the Form S-1 (file number 333-277068), filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024, which
are incorporated herein by reference. The risks described in such reports are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks
and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and/or operating results. 

We
are currently not in compliance with the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, and if we are unable to regain and maintain
compliance with the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock will be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market
which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their
shares. 

Our
common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and we are therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements
with respect to the market value of publicly-held shares, market value of listed shares, minimum bid price per share, and minimum stockholder s
equity, among others, and requirements relating to board and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements,
we may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market. 

On
July 15, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff of the Nasdaq Stock
Market Nasdaq notifying us that since we had failed to file our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024 we no longer
complied with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). We have filed the Form 10-Q, but there is no assurance that we will not incur similar deficiencies
in the future. 

On
August 19, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from the Staff notifying us that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Global Market s
Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(A), which requires a 10,000,000 minimum stockholders equity standard. We have been provided 45 calendar
days, or until November 18, 2024, to supply a specific plan to regain compliance with all Nasdaq Global Market listing requirements and
our time frame to complete the plan. If the plan is accepted, Nasdaq can grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date
of the letter, or until April 1, 2025, to evidence compliance. If the plan is not accepted, we will have the right to appeal and our
Class A common stock would remain listed on The Nasdaq Global Market until the completion of the appeal process. To regain compliance,
we must have stockholders equity of at least 10 million. 

On
November 5, 2024, we received two additional deficiency letters from the Staff notifying us that we were not in compliance with the requirement
to have market value of publicly held shares MVPHS of 15,000,000 and that we were not in compliance with the requirement
to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share. We have a compliance period of 180 calendar days (or May 5, 2025) in which to regain
compliance with both deficiencies. We can regain compliance with the MVPHS requirement, if at any time during this compliance period
our MVPHS closes at 15,000,000 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, We can regain compliance with the bid price requirement,
if at any time during this compliance period our closing bid price is at least 1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days,
In the event we do not regain compliance with these requirements prior to the expiration of the compliance period, we will receive written
notification that our securities are subject to delisting. 

Delisting
from The Nasdaq Capital Market would adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of
equity securities, may significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and
liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence,
the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities. 

We
have required the holders of our PIPE Convertible Notes on two occasions to waive requirements under the instruments and related agreements
in order to avoid being in default on the PIPE Convertible Notes, and there is no assurance such holders will agree to future waivers
if fall out of compliance with the requirements set forth in such instruments. 

We
currently have outstanding an aggregate of 8,155,625 in principal amount of PIPE Convertible Notes. In August and November 2024, the
holders of our PIPE Convertible Notes have agreed to waive requirements under the instruments and related agreements in order to avoid
having us be in default on the PIPE Convertible Notes. The waiver we received in November 2024 requires us to comply with the continued
listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market before January 15, 2025; provided that with respect to the minimum bid price requirement
to the extent we are in compliance with all other Nasdaq Stock Market listing requirements and have filed a preliminary proxy statement
to hold a special meeting to vote on a reverse stock split to remedy the bid price failure, the waiver shall be extended to March 15,
2025. As such, we will be required to satisfy the stockholders equity and MVPHS requirements prior to January 15, 2025 or receive
another waiver from the holders of our PIPE Convertible Notes, or we will be in default on the PIPE Convertible Notes, which would accelerate
the PIPE Convertible Notes and allow the holders to convert the PIPE Convertible Notes at the Alternate Conversion Price 
which is equal to the lesser of (i) the Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) 90 of the lowest volume weighted average price of
the Class A common stock during the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to such conversion.
