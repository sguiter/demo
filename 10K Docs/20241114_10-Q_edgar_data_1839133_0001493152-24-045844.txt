thousand and had a negative cash flow from operating activities of thousand. The accumulated deficit as of September
30, 2024 is thousand. 

Based
on the current expected level of operating expenditures, the Company s cash resources as of September 30, 2024 shall not be sufficient
for a period of at least 12 months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. Management s plans regarding these
matters include continued development and marketing of its products, as well as seeking additional financing arrangements. Although management
continues to pursue these plans, in the event financing is not obtained, the Company may pursue cost cutting measures or may be required
to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate any of its development programs, these events could have a material adverse effect on its
business. These factors raise significant doubt about the Company ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

C. 
 Iron
 Swords War 

Further
to the described in Note 1B to the Company s Annual Report on for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not experience
significant changes in its activities from the continuation of the war during the reporting period. However, the Company s management
continues to believe that the general conditions have brought further difficulties in management s efforts to seek additional financing
arrangements. 

The
Company assesses, on the basis of the information it has as of the date of the approval of these financial statements, that the current
events and the escalation in security in Israel, may have a material effect on its business plans in the short term and may cause delays
in the Company s research and development activities and in its marketing efforts. Since this is an event that is not under the
control of the Company and matters such as the continuation of the multi front war in Israel may affect the Company s assessments,
as of the reporting date the Company is unable to assess the extent of the effect of the Iron Swords War on its business.

The Company records a provision in its financial statements to the extent that it concludes that a contingent liability is probable, and the amount thereof is reasonably estimable. The Company s management assesses that the likelihood of the lawsuit
succeeding is low. However given the preliminary stage of the proceedings, the extent and amount of potential damages arising from the
lawsuit cannot be determined at this time, therefore no provisions have been made regarding the matter disclosed in this note. 

Accordingly, management s assessments involve complex judgments about future events and often rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.

and infrared spectroscopy technology platform allows harmless and non-invasive gathering of bio-information from a patient s blood
and tissue. Bioinformation is then analyzed using our AI-based algorithms to provide healthcare professionals with decision support in
the detection and monitoring of various disease conditions. 

PressureSafe :
Our first product based on this platform, is a handheld device designed to revolutionize the early detection of pressure injuries PIs affecting the skin and underlying tissue. PIs in the U.S. alone account for 26.8 billion in healthcare spending and result in 60,000
deaths annually. PressureSafe is expected to contribute to early detection of PIs, regardless of patient skin tone. This will
drive equitable healthcare and help reduce the toll and cost of PIs. We plan to launch PressureSafe as a decision support system (DSS)
tool for caregivers in hospitals, nursing homes, and home-care companies. On April 9, 2024, the PressureSafe decision support device
received a U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA listing certification. PressureSafe is classified as a Class I device.
We are currently working on completing the development of the commercial version of the PressureSafe device, with initial sales planned
during the first half of 2025, following the listing with the FDA. 

DiaSafe:
 Similarities in the physiological development of PIs and diabetic foot ulcers DFU under the skin surface allow the
IRMED PressureSafe device to be adopted to support the early detection of DFU among diabetic patients at high risk of developing DFU.
We are assessing and planning the development of our second product, which is a handheld optical monitoring device that will support
early detection of DFUs in lower limb skin and underlying tissue, primarily caused by prolonged pressure on the sole among diabetic patients
a condition, which sometimes is accompanied by other comorbidities as lower limb neuropathy. 

14 

Our
novel technology platform will enable direct assessment of the development of a DFU before it becomes an open wound that may lead to
limb amputation. The Israeli Innovation Authority (the IIA has approved our plan to develop a diabetic foot ulcer
device for early detection of DFU. On January 25, 2024, the IIA approved a program to develop a device for the early detection of
diabetic foot ulcers among diabetic patients, with a project budget of NIS 3,761,978 (approximately US 1,030,000) which includes an
amount equal to 50 grant of the total budget provided at the time of the grant, disbursed in installments over the course of 13
months, by the project s progress. In consideration for the grant by the IIA, the subsidiary is required to pay royalties at
the rate of 3 -5 from the total sales until the repayment date of the full amount of the grant, plus annual interest at the SOFR
rate. In addition, the IIA must approve any arrangement whereby the Company seeks to transfer the technology relating to the
project, or its development, from Israel. Following the IIA grant we plan to commence a clinical trial in the center of
Israel s leading diabetes clinic. As of September 30, 2024 we received a grant from the IIA in the amount of approximately
 387,000, to develop our platform technology for a new indication, a decision support device for the early detection of diabetic
foot ulcers. The grant s 13-month development timeline is proceeding on schedule, as we have achieved the mid-point
milestones. Computer simulations of infrared light reflectance from lesions under the skin surface have been completed, and based on
these data, we are building the DiaSafe device s hardware in accordance with the development plan agreed upon with the
IIA. 

Future
indication as part of our research and development is an innovative otoscope, Nobiotics , to support physicians with an immediate
indication as to whether mid-ear infection (otitis media), a common malady in children, is of a bacterial origin and thus requiring antibiotic
treatment, or of a viral origin that consequently does not require antibiotic treatment. 

Our
technology platform utilizes AI. AI is a broad term generally used to describe conditions where a machine mimics cognitive 
functions associated with human intelligence, such as learning and problem-solving. Basic AI includes machine
learning, where a machine uses algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then suggest a determination or prediction about a given
phenomenon. The machine is trained using large amounts of data and algorithms that provide it with the ability to learn
how to perform various tasks. 

The
global diagnostics market is driven in large by solutions that can be applied in healthcare settings, as these tools will drive decisions
regarding specific treatments and the associated outlays. However, despite advances in medical imaging and other diagnostic tools, misdiagnosis
remains a common occurrence. 

Our
initial focus is on the development of decision support system solutions utilizing our proprietary platform for the pre-emptive diagnosis
of PIs, and diabetic foot ulcers. Our current business plan focuses on two principal medical devices: 

1. 
 PressureSafe , a
 handheld skin-agnostic optical monitoring device that is being developed to support early detection of PIs to the skin and underlying
 tissue, primarily caused by prolonged pressure associated with bed confinement; and 

2. 
 DiaSafe, a handheld
 optical monitoring device that is being developed to support early detection of DFUs in lower limb skin and underlying tissue, primarily
 caused by prolonged pressure on the sole of the foot, among diabetic patients a condition, which sometimes is accompanied by other
 comorbidities as lower limb neuropathy. 

On
April 9, 2024, the PressureSafe decision support device received an FDA listing certification. PressureSafe is classified as a
Class I device and is exempt from 510(k) premarket submission. We are currently working on completing larger scale production of the
commercial version of the PressureSafe device, with initial sales planned during the first half of 2025, following the listing with the
FDA. 

Recent
Developments 

On
August 21, 2024, our board of directors (the Board appointed Mr. Ran Ziskind to serve as our Chief Executive Officer (CEO),
replacing Mr. Ronnie Klein, who had been serving as Interim CEO, effective September 1, 2024. Mr. Ziskind also serves as the Chief Executive
Officer of our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Med Ltd., an Israeli corporation. In conjunction with his appointment, we entered into an
employment agreement with Mr. Ziskind (the Employment Agreement ), pursuant to which he will be subject to standard confidentiality,
intellectual property assignment and non-compete provisions. In addition, in consideration for his service, Mr. Ziskind receives a monthly
gross salary of NIS 6,000 until we will raise at least 4,000,000 in funding, and following such potential capital raise, his compensation
will be increased to NIS 45,000 per month, as well as will be entitled to NIS 10,000 for car expenses. Under the Employment Agreement,
Mr. Ziskind will also receive 1,400,000 restricted shares of our Common Stock, at an exercise price of 0.58 per share (the Shares ).
The Shares will vest over a four-year period commencing on the grant date such that (i) 350,000 of the Shares will become fully vested
and exercisable on the first anniversary elapsed from the grant date and (ii) the balance will vest in six (6) bi-annual installments
of 175,000 Shares, subject to Mr. Ziskind s continued employment. 

15 

On
September 10, 2024, we announced the start of a usability study for our lead product, PressureSafe , at San Antonio, Texas based
Methodist Healthcare. The study, titled Safety and Efficacy of the PressureSafe Device for Early Detection of Pressure Injury
in People with Various Skin Tones, Including Dark Skin Tones, has received approval from Methodist Healthcare and has commenced
patient enrollment and monitoring. Methodist Healthcare is widely regarded as one of the most respected healthcare providers in its region.
With a growing network of care locations including hospitals, surgery centers, ERs, and family health clinics, each year Methodist Healthcare
serves 608,000 patients, including 11,000 births, and 330,000 ER visits. The study aims to improve the early detection and prevention
of pressure injuries among all patients. Importantly, the study aims to address the substantial challenge of healthcare inequality in
the detection of pressure injuries in people of dark skin tones who are more than twice as likely to suffer from pressure injuries than
those with lighter skin tone, according to a 5-year study published in Wounds. The current standard of care relies on visual inspection
of the skin, which can be less effective for early detection in individuals with darker skin tones. Up to 104 people will be enrolled
in the study, approximately half with dark skin tones. Registered nurses specialized in wound care (WOCN) will be trained in using PressureSafe .
Sensitivity and specificity will be assessed and compared to standard of care visual skin assessment done by the WOCN nurses. 

On
October 15, 2024, we announced the termination of our Distribution and License Agreement with PI Prevention Care LLC, or the Distributor,
dated October 7, 2022, as a result of our notice to the Distributor of the Distributor s material breach of the Distribution and
License following its failure to timely pay the license fee as required. 

On
October 31, 2024, our Board approved a reduction in the monthly payments made to Mr. Aharon Klein, our Chief Technology Officer, in light
of our current cash position, which was agreed upon with Mr. Klein. Under the amended terms of Mr. Klein s service provider agreement,
he will receive monthly payments of NIS 16,000, instead of NIS, 30,000, plus NIS 5,000 for car expenses totaling a monthly compensation
of NIS 21,000 starting from October 2024 onwards. 

On
October 31, 2024, the Board of Directors approved the reduction in the monthly payments made to Mr. Yaniv Cohen, our Chief Scientific
Officer, pursuant to his service provider agreement, from his current rate of NIS 15,000 to NIS 8,000, commencing in October 2024. 

Key
Financial Terms and Metrics 

The

Research
and Development Expenses 

The
process of researching and developing our product candidates is lengthy, unpredictable, and subject to many risks. We expect to continue
incurring substantial expenses for the next several years as we continue to develop our product candidates. We are unable, with any certainty,
to estimate either the costs or the timelines in which those expenses will be incurred. Our current development plans focus on the development
the next generation of our PressureSafe device and develop the DiaSafe, device. The design and development of these devices
will consume a large proportion of our current, as well as projected, resources. 

Our
research and development costs are comprised of: 

internal recurring costs, such as personnel-related costs (salaries, employee benefits, equity compensation, and other costs), materials
and supplies, facilities and maintenance costs attributable to research and development functions; and 

fees paid to external parties who provide us with contract services, such as preclinical testing, manufacturing, related testing, and
clinical trial activities.

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We
are subject to risks common to companies in the medical device industry, including but not limited to, the need for additional capital,
the need to obtain marketing approval and reimbursement for any product candidate that we may identify and develop, the need to successfully
commercialize and gain market acceptance of our product candidates, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology,
compliance with government regulations, development of technological innovations by competitors, reliance on third-party manufacturers
and the ability to transition from pilot-scale production to large-scale manufacturing of products. 

From
inception, we have funded our operations from a combination of loans and sales of equity instruments. In 2021 and 2022, we raised aggregate
gross proceeds of 5,830,000 and 3,625,000, respectively, from sales of our equity and equity linked securities. In addition, on June
12, 2023, we raised aggregate gross proceeds of 1,000,000 from sales of our shares of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of
common stock. On June 4, 2024, and July 10, 2024, we raised aggregate gross proceeds of 755,000 from sales of our shares of common stock
and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 392,000 in cash resources and approximately 531,000 of liabilities, including 376,000 of current liabilities
from operations. 

The
following table provides a summary of operating, investing, and financing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in
thousands):

We
have experienced operating losses since inception and had a total accumulated deficit of 16,460,000 as of September 30, 2024. We expect
to incur additional costs and will require additional capital to realize our business plans. These losses have resulted from significant
cash expenditures used in operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our cash used in operations was approximately
 1,125,000 and 2,478,000, respectively. As we continue to conduct our business activities, we expect that the cash needed to fund our
operations will increase significantly over the next several years, as we will need to continue and intensify our research and development
efforts for our product candidates (which are in various stages of development), strengthen our patent portfolio, establish operations
processes, and pursue FDA clearance and international regulatory approvals. 

19 

We
need to obtain additional funding in order to pursue our business plans. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive
terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts. 

We
expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements until December
31, 2024. Our requirements for additional capital during this period will depend on many factors, including the following: 

the
 scope, rate of progress, results and cost of our development and engineering efforts to develop
 the PressureSafe and DiaSafe devices, clinical studies (to the extent necessary), preliminary
 testing activities and other related activities; 
 
 the
 cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory related efforts for commercial sales approvals; 
 
 the
 cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; 
 
 the
 terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish; 
 
 the
 timing, receipt and amount of sales, profit sharing or royalties, if any, from our potential
 products; 
 
 the
 cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other
 intellectual property rights; and 
 
 the
 extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies, although we
 currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and as of the date of this report, we assessed our financial
condition and concluded that based on our current and projected cash resources and commitments, as well as other factors mentioned above,
there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are planning to raise additional capital to continue
our operations, as well as to explore additional avenues to increase revenues and reduce expenditures. We cannot be sure that future
funding will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Due to the often-volatile nature of financial markets, equity and debt
financing may be difficult to obtain. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of private or
public equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution
arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations,
strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights, future revenue streams,
or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through private or
public equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include
liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing,
we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making
capital expenditures or declaring dividends. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
a smaller reporting company, as defined by 229.10(f)(1), we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of September 30, 2024, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). The term
 disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the requisite time periods and that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to its management, including its principal executive and principal accounting officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024, our principal Chief Executive Officer and principal Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date,
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at reasonable assurance level, as further described below. 

Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II-OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On
May 29, 2023, a lawsuit was filed against the Company, the Subsidiary, and Mr. Aharon Klein, or the Plaintiff, a Company Director, and
the Company s Chief Technology Officer in the Tel Aviv District Court of Israel by an individual who provided, on a part-time basis,
certain consulting services to the Subsidiary between October 2015 through October 2016, before the acquisition of the Subsidiary by
the Company. The lawsuit alleges breach of contract by the defendants based on non-payment of amounts purportedly owed to the Plaintiff
in respect of the services rendered, including the market value of the Company s common stock that the Plaintiff alleges should
have been issued to him in respect of his services. The suit seeks declaratory judgment that the defendants breached certain agreements
with Plaintiff and claimed damages in the aggregate amount of approximately 2.1 million based on the current exchange rate between the
U.S. Dollar and the Israeli NIS. 

The
Company believes that the allegations are baseless and without merit. The Company intends to vigorously defend its rights. 

Other
than as set forth above, the Company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings. However, from time to time we may become involved
in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including actions related to our intellectual property. Although
the outcomes of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings
that arise in the ordinary course of business, including actions related to our intellectual property. Although the outcomes of these
legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe,
either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
