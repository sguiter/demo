Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Any statements other than statements of historical or current fact in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward looking statements. In some instances, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as believes, anticipates, plans, expects, estimates, intends, predicts, projects, targets, could, may, will, and similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements include such identifying words. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to statements regarding: 
 our product development plans, expectations for and the timing of commencement, enrollment, completion, data, and release of results of clinical trials for our product candidates; 

our estimates regarding our liquidity, expenses, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; 

our strategies with respect to our preclinical and clinical development programs, including our expectations regarding the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates; 

our plans, strategy and timing to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals of our product candidates; 

our expectations regarding competitive conditions for our product candidates; 

our review of strategic alternatives and the outcome of such review; and 

our expectations about our future financial performance or condition. 

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the factors listed under Risk Factor Summary below. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company s actual results to differ significantly from the forward-looking statements contained herein, are described in greater detail in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on our current beliefs, assumptions, expectations, estimates and projections, which may be impacted by known or unknown factors. Any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speak only as of the date hereof and not as of any future date, and the Company expressly disclaims any intent to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The market data and certain other statistical information used in this Quarterly Report are based on independent industry publications, governmental publications, reports by market research firms or other independent sources. Some data are also based on our good faith estimates. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections, market research or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties and actual events or circumstances may differ materially from events and circumstances reflected in this information.

RISK FACTOR SUMMARY 
 The following summarizes the principal factors that make an investment in the Company speculative or risky, all of which are more fully described in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This summary should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. You should consider all of the risk factors described in our public filings when evaluating our business. 
 Our short operating history and shifts in our business strategy may make it difficult to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability. 

We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and expect that we will continue to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability. 

We will require additional funding to be able to complete the development of our lead drug candidate. If we are unable to raise such capital, or if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms, we will be forced to significantly alter our business strategy, substantially curtail our current operations, or liquidate and cease operations altogether. 

Issuances of our common stock, including common stock that may be issuable pursuant to outstanding warrants or other convertible securities as well as shares and warrants issued or issuable in connection with our recent private placement transactions, could result in significant dilution and could cause our stock price to fall. 

Our product candidates are in the early stages of clinical development and may not be successfully developed. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize these or any other product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. 

Unfavorable global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Adverse conditions in the financial markets, including bank failures, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance. 

Drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, including failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development, formulation and commercialization of our product candidates. 

The results of nonclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and there is a risk that additional nonclinical and/or clinical safety studies will be required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States or that subsequent studies will not match results seen in prior studies. 

Delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials could delay or prevent our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and increase expenses for the development of our product candidates. 

If serious adverse events or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may need to abandon or limit our development of some of our product candidates. 

Our future success depends on our ability to retain executives and key employees and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel in the future. 

If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, or the approvals may be for a narrow indication, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue may be materially impaired. 

Legislation regulating the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain. 

Our internal computer systems, or those of our third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, disruptions, or incidents, which could result in a material disruption of our development programs or loss of data or compromise the privacy, security, integrity or 

3 

confidentiality of sensitive information related to our business and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Even if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, we may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success. 

If our current product candidates, or a future product candidate receives marketing approval and we, or others, later discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, our ability to market the product could be compromised. 

We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do. 

The insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly-approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue. 

Our reliance on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for nonclinical and clinical trials, and for eventual commercialization, increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products at an acceptable cost and quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts. 

We depend on contract research organizations CROs and other contracted third parties to perform nonclinical and clinical testing and certain other research and development activities. As a result, the outcomes of the activities performed by these organizations will be, to a certain extent, beyond our control. 

If we are unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our technology and products or if the scope of the intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired. 

Public health crises, including pandemics or epidemics, could adversely affect our business. 

Our stock price could be volatile, and the market price of our common stock may drop unexpectedly. 

If we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and our ability to operate our business could be harmed. 

Provisions in our corporate charter and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of the Company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.

 , Eledon acquired Anelixis Therapeutics, Inc. Anelixis ), a privately held clinical stage biotechnology company developing a next generation anti-CD40L antibody as a potential treatment for organ and cellular transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. The Company maintains its corporate headquarters in Irvine, California and has research and development facilities in Burlington, Massachusetts. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements During the preparation of the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company determined that the Common Warrants and the Subsequent Closing Warrants (each as defined in Note 8) do not meet the conditions to be classified as equity instruments under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity, ASC 815-40 and must instead be recorded as liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheet at their fair value and remeasured at fair value for each subsequent reporting period. As a result, the Company determined that a correction was necessary with respect to the Company s reporting and recording of the fair value of the Common Warrants and the Subsequent Closing Warrants. Certain prior period financial statements and financial information are presented herein as restated. See Note 12 for further information.

of the issued and outstanding common stock or other ownership interest in Anelixis Therapeutics, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Otic Pharma, Ltd., a private limited company organized under the laws of the State of Israel Otic ). Otic owns of the issued and outstanding common stock or other ownership interest in its U.S. subsidiary, Otic Pharma, Inc. The functional currency of the Company s foreign subsidiary is the U.S. Dollar; however, certain expenses, assets and liabilities are transacted at the local currency. These transactions are translated from the local currency into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates during or at the end of the reporting period. The activities of the Company s foreign subsidiary are not significant to the condensed consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions among the entities have been eliminated from the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. These results include a million gain related to changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities and the fair value of financial instruments issued in excess of proceeds, recorded in the third quarter ending September 30, 2024. Excluding this gain, the Company would have recorded net losses of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of million, working capital of million and an accumulated deficit of million. On October 29, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Leerink Partners, LLC, as representative of the several underwriters named therein in connection with the underwritten offering, issuance and sale by the Company (the "Offering") of shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share, at an offering price of per share, and pre-funded warrants at a price of per pre-funded warrant, which are exercisable to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of per share. The Offering resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of million, or net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. See Note 11. Subsequent Events for additional

when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash in readily available checking accounts, money market funds, U.S. government securities and U.S. government agency securities. The carrying amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents are valued at cost, which approximates their fair value due to the short-term maturities of these investments.

This update requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. ASU No. 2023-09 is effective for public entities with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.

This update requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis.

million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. On April 19, 2024, the Company entered into a operating lease for square feet of office space in Irvine, California, that expires on (the Irvine Lease Agreement ). On April 19, 2024, in conjunction with the Irvine Lease Agreement, the Company terminated an existing operating lease for square feet of office space in Irvine, California, that was set to expire on . On April 19, 2024, the effective date of the Irvine Lease Agreement, the Company recognized additional net ROU assets and lease liabilities in the amount of million. On September 4, 2024, the Company entered into a operating lease for square feet of office space in Burlington, Massachusetts, that expires on (the Burlington Lease Agreement ). The existing lease will expire on November 20, 2024. The Company will recognize additional net ROU assets and lease liabilities for the Burlington Lease Agreement beginning November 21, 2024. The Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception. Our office leases have a remaining term of approximately and do not include options to extend the leases for additional periods. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities as adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease payments, initial direct costs, lease incentives, and impairment of operating lease assets. To determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid, we estimate incremental secured borrowing rates corresponding to the maturities of the leases. As we have outstanding debt nor committed credit facilities, secured or otherwise, we estimate this rate based on prevailing financial market conditions, comparable company and credit analysis, and management s judgment. Our leases contain rent escalations over the lease term. We recognize expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally, tenant incentives used to fund leasehold improvements are recognized when earned and reduce our right-of-use asset related to the lease. These are amortized through the right-of-use asset as reductions of expense over the lease term. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. While we do not currently have any lease agreement with lease and non-lease components, we elected to account for lease and non-lease components as separate components. We have elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all applicable classes of underlying assets. Short-term disclosures include only those leases with a term greater than one month and 12 months or less, and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, that do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that we are reasonably certain to exercise, are not recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Grants and Licenses ALS Therapy Development Foundation, Inc. License Agreement In May 2015, Anelixis executed a License Agreement (the Agreement ), which is an exclusive patent rights agreement with ALS Therapy Development Foundation, Inc. ALS TDI for certain patents and know-how of ALS TDI. This Agreement continues until the licensee terminates the agreement with ninety days written notice. The Agreement requires license fees payable to ALS TDI, subject to the achievement of certain milestones and other conditions. The first and second milestones of the Agreement are the dosing of the first subjects in a first toxicity study in non-human primates and the dosing of the first patient in a Phase I Clinical Trial, respectively. Both of these milestones were achieved as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The fee due for the achievement of these milestones was million each. During 2018 and 2017, Anelixis issued million worth of its common stock in lieu of making a cash payment. There were milestones achieved during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. The Agreement was amended and restated in February 2020, and a first amendment to the restated license agreement was executed in September 2020. As amended in September 2020, the remaining milestone payments for a first licensed product total million. In the event that the Company develops a second licensed product, the Company is obligated to pay up to million in additional milestone payments. In addition to the milestone payments, the Company is required to pay ALS TDI an amended annual license maintenance fee of million beginning on the earlier of January 1, 2022, the Company s first sublicense, or change in control, as defined in the Agreement. The Company has made a million annual license maintenance fee each year since 2022. Furthermore, the Company is required to pay ALS TDI fees based on reaching certain levels of annual net sales of any product produced with the patent rights. A royalty in the low single digits will be due on aggregate net sales. Upon the first calendar year of reaching million in aggregate net sales, the Company will be required to pay ALS TDI a one-time milestone payment of million. Upon the first calendar year of reaching billion in aggregate net sales, the Company is obligated to pay ALS TDI a one-time milestone payment of million.

 ABOUT ELEDON PHARMACEUTICALS 
 Overview 
 Eledon is a clinical stage biotechnology company using our immunology expertise in targeting the CD40 Ligand CD40L pathway to develop therapies to protect transplanted organs and prevent rejection, and to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS ). Our lead compound in development is tegoprubart, an IgG1, anti-CD40L antibody with high affinity for the CD40 Ligand, a well-validated biological target that we believe has broad therapeutic potential. We believe the central role of CD40L signaling in both adaptive and innate immune cell activation and function positions it as an attractive target for non-lymphocyte depleting, immunomodulatory therapeutic intervention. 
 Tegoprubart is engineered to potentially both improve safety and provide pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and dosing advantages compared to other anti-CD40 approaches. The CD40L/CD40 pathway is recognized for its prominent role in immune regulation. CD40L is primarily expressed on activated CD4+ T cells, platelets and endothelial cells while the CD40 receptor is constitutively expressed on antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as B cells. By blocking CD40L and not the CD40 receptor, tegoprubart inhibits both the CD40 and CD11 costimulatory signaling pathways, providing the potential for improved efficacy compared to anti-CD40 receptor approaches. Blocking CD40L also increases polarization of CD4+ lymphocytes to Tregs, a specialized subpopulation of T cells that act to suppress an immune response, thus creating a more tolerogenic environment, which may play a therapeutic role in autoimmune diseases and in the prevention of allograft rejection after solid organ transplantation. 
 Tegoprubart is designed to negate the risk of thrombolytic events seen in the first generation of anti-CD40L antibodies by introducing structural modifications that have been shown in preclinical models to eliminate binding to the Fc receptors associated with platelet activation without altering the binding of tegoprubart to CD40L. In non-human primate studies, dosing of tegoprubart up to 200 mg/kg per week for 26 weeks, demonstrated no adverse events regarding coagulation, platelet activation or thromboembolism. 
 Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to optimize the clinical and commercial value of tegoprubart and become a global biopharmaceutical company with a focused immunology franchise. Our strategy is to develop tegoprubart for the prevention of rejection of allograft (i.e., transplanting an organ from one human to another) and xenograft (i.e., transplanting an organ from an animal to a human) organs and cells, and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as ALS. We selected our indications based on preclinical and clinical data that was generated with either tegoprubart or historical anti-CD40L molecules. In January 2023, we announced plans to prioritize and focus resources on our kidney transplantation programs, discontinue our IgAN program and the funding of our islet cell transplantation program. We remain committed to further progressing ALS clinical development and are working with key stakeholders on potential next steps to do so. However, we are unable to continue our clinical development of tegoprubart for people with ALS without additional financing. 
 
 Acquisition 
 In September 2020, we acquired Anelixis Therapeutics, Inc. Anelixis ), the company that owned and controlled the intellectual property related to tegoprubart. See Note 7 of the Notes to Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details of grants and licenses related to this acquisition. 
 29 

Prior to our acquisition of Anelixis, we focused on developing medicines for patients with disorders of the ear, nose, and throat ENT ). In June 2020, we announced that our lead program did not achieve statistical significance for the primary efficacy endpoints in the treatment of acute otitis media. As a result of this failure to achieve the primary study endpoint, we suspended the clinical development of our legacy ENT assets while we assessed potential development strategies. Following the June 2020 announcement, we significantly curtailed development expenses as we sought to identify strategic alternatives that would maximize stockholder value. As a result of these activities, we acquired Anelixis and raised additional capital in September 2020, as described above. After acquiring Anelixis, we terminated our ENT activities and returned our product rights to the original license holders in July 2021. 
 Clinical Development of Tegoprubart for the Prevention of Allograft Rejection in Kidney Transplantation 
 In January 2023, we announced plans to prioritize and focus resources on our kidney transplantation programs. We are first focusing on kidney transplantation as this is the most common type of solid organ transplantation in the U.S. with an estimated 255,000 Americans living with a transplanted kidney. There are an estimated 25,000 kidneys transplanted annually in the U.S. Over 97,000 people in the U.S. wait 3-5 years on average for a kidney transplant and about 5,000 people in need of a kidney transplant die each year while waiting for a suitable kidney. Approximately 11 of U.S. people on the waiting list are waiting for a repeat transplant. There remains a critical shortage of kidneys and other organs available for transplantation. 
 There has been little innovation in immunosuppression therapy for organ transplant patients over the past 30 years. The standard of care immunosuppressive drugs used post-transplant have been shown to reduce the risk of organ rejection, but they are also associated with potentially toxic side effects. Organ transplant recipients require immunosuppression on a lifelong basis, and any disruption in the immunosuppression therapy can trigger transplant rejection. Calcineurin inhibitors CNI s) are a critical component of most immunosuppressive regimens to prevent acute and long-term kidney transplant rejection. However, chronic exposure to CNIs (tacrolimus is the drug most commonly used) is associated with nephrotoxicity, hypertension, new onset diabetes due to pancreatic beta cell toxicity, as well as central nervous system CNS side effects, like tremor. Over time, these CNI side effects may significantly damage the transplanted kidneys or result in a requirement for reduced exposures to CNIs which can lead to an increased risk of rejection. Moreover, CNS side effects like tremors may result in patients decreasing their adherence to their medicines. Today, an implanted kidney is expected to fail within 10-15 years on average using currently available immunosuppression options. The fact that American transplant patients are on average in their 50s means that many of them will ultimately need a second or even third transplant procedure during their lifetime or a return to dialysis. 
 The central role of CD40L signaling in generating pro-inflammatory responses makes it a highly attractive candidate for therapeutic intervention in the protection of transplanted organs and prevention of transplant rejection. Results from prior studies demonstrate that targeting and blocking CD40L has the potential for better efficacy and improved safety, including reduced risk of nephrotoxicity, diabetes, hypertension, and other side effects associated with standard-of-care CNIs such as tacrolimus. 
 Tegoprubart seeks to address challenges associated with current immunosuppressive transplantation regimens using CNI-based therapies. The ability to prevent acute and chronic transplant rejection without the need for CNIs has the potential to transform the clinical management of preventing graft rejection by mitigating the adverse events associated with CNIs and improving long-term graft survival, thus potentially decreasing the need for repeat kidney transplants and increasing organ availability for other patients on the wait list. By identifying and advancing novel strategies in immunosuppression including targeting the CD40L pathway, we may be able to help organs remain functional for longer and potentially throughout the natural lifespan of each recipient. 
 We have received regulatory approvals in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, for a Phase 1b clinical trial of tegoprubart in up to 24 subjects, replacing tacrolimus as an immunosuppressive regimen component in patients undergoing de novo kidney transplantation. Each participant will receive rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) induction and a maintenance regimen consisting of tegoprubart, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint of the study is safety. Other endpoints include glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), characterizing the pharmacokinetic profile of tegoprubart, and the incidence of biopsy proven rejection. The first subject in the Phase 1b study was dosed in July 2022. 
 Better graft function as assessed by eGFR, has been associated with improved long-term patient and graft survival and is an early predictor of future graft failure. Historical studies have reported average eGFRs generally in the low 50 
 30 

mL/min/1.73m2 range during the first year after kidney transplant using current standard of care immunosuppression. An eGFR of 50 mL/min/1.73m2 or below indicates chronic kidney disease. 
 We reported interim safety and efficacy results from the Phase 1b clinical trial in March 2023, and provided updated data in November 2023 and June 2024. At the time of the June 2024 update, which reported data as of April 3, 2024, results from the 13 participants in the Phase 1b trial support tegoprubart s potential to protect organ function in patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Data from historical studies using standard of care, calcineurin inhibitor-based, immunosuppression therapy typically report aggregate mean estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) of approximately 50 mL/min/1.73m2 during the first year after kidney transplant. In the ongoing Phase 1b trial, as of April 3, 2024, mean eGFR was above 60 mL/min/1.73m at each reported time points after day 30, with an overall mean eGFR of 70.5 mL/min/1.73m for all the reported time points after day 30 post-transplant. Two participants completed 12 months on therapy post-transplant, and both demonstrated mean eGFRs above 90 mL/min/1.73m at one-year post-transplant. The interim results demonstrated that tegoprubart is generally safe and well tolerated in patients undergoing de novo kidney transplantation. As of April 3, 2024, three subjects have discontinued the study due to hair loss and fatigue, viral infection, and rejection, respectively. There have been no cases of hyperglycemia, new onset diabetes, or tremor, all of which are side effects often associated with standard of care immunosuppression therapy. There have been no cases of graft loss or death. 
 In July 2022, we received Investigational New Drug (IND) application clearance from the FDA for our controlled, Phase 2 BESTOW trial of tegoprubart for the prevention of transplant rejection in persons receiving a kidney transplant. The BESTOW study is a multi-center, two-arm, active comparator, head-to-head superiority clinical study, and will enroll approximately 120 participants undergoing kidney transplantation in the U.S. and other countries to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of tegoprubart compared to the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus. The study s primary objective is to assess graft function as measured by estimated eGFR at 12 months post-transplant in participants treated with tegoprubart compared to tacrolimus. Secondary objectives will include assessment of graft survival, biopsy-proven acute rejection, and the incidence of new onset diabetes mellitus after transplant. The BESTOW study is running in parallel to the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial of tegoprubart in kidney transplantation. The first subject in the BESTOW study was dosed in August 2023. On September 4, 2024, we announced the completion of enrollment in the BESTOW study. 
 In October 2023, we enrolled the first participant in a Phase 2 open-label extension (OLE) study which is designed to evaluate the long-term safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of tegoprubart in participants who have completed one year of treatment in either the ongoing Phase 1b study or the Phase 2 BESTOW study. 
 Clinical Development of Tegoprubart for the Prevention of Allograft Rejection in Xenotransplantation 
 While inhibition of CD40L has shown it may play an important role in immunosuppression in allograft kidney transplantation, this mechanism of action may also play a role in the prevention of xenotransplant rejection (i.e., transplanting an organ from an animal to a human). 
 In January 2023, we entered into a non-exclusive collaborative research agreement with eGenesis, Inc., ("eGenesis"), under which eGenesis gained access to tegoprubart for preclinical and clinical xenotransplantation studies in support of eGenesis kidney, heart and islet cell xenotransplantation programs. 
 Clinical Development of Tegoprubart for the Prevention of Allograft Rejection in Islet Cell Transplantation ("ICT") 
 Type 1 diabetes ("T1D") is a T cell mediated autoimmune disease with progressive loss of insulin producing pancreatic beta cells and affects approximately 2 million persons in the United States. Approximately 33 of people with T1D report impaired awareness of hypoglycemia regardless of continuous glucose monitoring or automated insulin usage. Approximately 12 of people with T1D experience recurrent severe hypoglycemic events annually, putting them at higher risk for adverse outcomes. Approximately 5 to 8 of adults with T1D experience diabetic ketoacidosis annually, often as a result of poor glycemic control. ICT is gaining attention as a thera peutic option for T1D because it can restore physiological insulin secretion, minimize the risk of hypoglycemic unawareness, and reduce the risk of death due to severe hypoglycemia. The advances made in this field over the past decade have improved patient outcomes, and the procedure has been evolving from an experimental treatment to a clinical treatment option. 
 A number of issues are believed to continue to hamper the overall success of ICT and to need to be addressed in order for there to be widespread clinical acceptance. These include the acute loss of transplanted islets with current immunosuppressive treatments, particularly those with CNI-based therapies, due to islet cell toxicity and alloreactive immunologic responses to transplanted islets. Over time, the progressive loss of islet cells and decline in islet cell function 
 31 

can lead to the need for multiple transplants in order for T1D patients to have optimal response to blood glucose levels and possibly achieve insulin independence. Tegoprubart seeks to address the challenges associated with current ICT immunosuppressive regimens using CNI-based therapies, by replacing the CNIs with tegoprubart to prevent rejection and protect the transplanted cells. We believe that tegoprubart may unlock the ICT market by potentially improving islet cell graft survival and reduce the side effects associated with standard of care regimens. 
 Historical studies in nonhuman primate models of ICT have demonstrated that treatment with anti-CD40L antibodies induces long term islet cell function and graft survival, even as a monotherapy. Tegoprubart has shown pre-clinical, proof-of-concept efficacy in a non-human primate model of T1D, where animals undergoing ICT maintained glucose control and sustained levels of C-peptide with chronic tegoprubart treatment for up to a year. Compared to combination immunosuppressive therapy including CNIs, tegoprubart monotherapy was more effective in preventing long term islet cell rejection, associated with better graft function, and showed an improved safety profile. 
 In 2022, the FDA granted orphan designation to tegoprubart for the prevention of allograft rejection in pancreatic islet cell transplantation. 
 In January 2024, we announced that tegoprubart would be utilized in an investigator-initiated trial, conducted at the University of Chicago Medicine's Transplantation Institute. This pilot study is assessing the safety of using a monoclonal antibody against CD40 ligand to achieve a calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppression regimen in patients with T1D mellitus undergoing islet cell transplantation. The Company is not funding this trial but is providing tegoprubart for use in the study. 
 On October 29, 2024, positive data were reported for the first three islet transplant recipients in the study, potentially demonstrating the first human cases of insulin independence achieved using an anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody therapy without the use of tacrolimus. The first two subjects achieved insulin independence and normal hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels, a measure of average blood glucose, post-transplant. The third subject, decreased insulin use by more than 60 three days following the procedure and continues on insulin independence trajectory typically observed one-to-two months post-transplant. Subjects in the study received islet transplants combined with induction therapy and for chronic maintenance therapy, mycophenolate mofetil plus tegoprubart given every third week by intravenous infusion. The first two subjects achieved insulin independence and presented stable islet graft function at approximately three months and six months post-transplant, respectively. Islet engraftment, measured by graft function standardized to the number of islets infused, was three to five times higher than three comparable subjects who received tacrolimus-based immunosuppression, suggesting treatment with tegoprubart is less toxic to transplanted islets resulting in improved graft survival and function. Treatment was generally well tolerated in all subjects with no unexpected adverse events or hypoglycemic episodes. After initial islet transplant, the first participant reduced insulin requirements by over 60 and normalized blood glucose control. The first patient then achieved insulin independence within approximately a week after the second islet transplantation procedure. 
 Clinical Development of Tegoprubart for ALS 
 ALS is a progressive, paralytic disorder characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. In the U.S., the incidence is estimated at approximately 5,000 cases per year with a prevalence of approximately 30,000 cases overall. Despite 3 approved drugs, in most cases, death from respiratory failure occurs between 3 to 5 years from diagnosis, with 50 of patients living at least 3 years from diagnosis and only 20 of patients living at least 5 years from diagnosis. 
 While the exact pathogenic mechanism of ALS is still not fully understood, there is strong evidence indicating that neuroinflammation plays an important role in the disease s pathogenesis. Neuroinflammation in ALS is characterized by the infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages into the central nervous system, and the activation of microglia and reactive astrocytes. Reactive astrocytes and microglia as well as infiltrating lymphocytes, dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages and immune complexes have been identified in cerebrospinal fluid and neural tissues in both animal models of ALS and at autopsy in ALS patients. 
 Tegoprubart is designed to block CD40L binding to CD40, thereby potentially inhibiting neuroinflammatory pathways leading to disease progression in ALS. In vitro proof-of-concept studies have shown that tegoprubart binds to CD40L in human cells and blocks CD40L binding on antigen presenting cells and activated T cells. The potential for therapeutic benefit of CD40L blockage in treating ALS has been demonstrated in a SOD1 mouse model of ALS, where a murine anti-CD40L antibody, MR1, prolonged survival and delayed the onset of neurological disease progression. These pathophysiological manifestations are believed to be due to reduced immune cell infiltration of macrophages into skeletal muscle and their destroying denervated nerves. The plasticity of the nervous system to repair itself in the absence of this 
 32 

immune cell attack is believed to result in improved neuromuscular junction occupancy and improved muscle function. Blocking CD40L signaling also prevents pro-inflammatory polarization of lymphocytes, reduced neuroinflammation and improved motor neuron survival in rodent ALS models. 
 In 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to tegoprubart for ALS. In 2019, we completed a single ascending dose Phase 1 study of tegoprubart in healthy volunteers and people with ALS. In this study, the doses of tegoprubart studied were well tolerated in healthy adult subjects and adults with ALS. Tegoprubart demonstrated low anti-drug antibody responses that were not dose related, linear dose proportionality across the dose ranges, and a half-life of up to 26 days. 
 In October 2020, we initiated a Phase 2a, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of tegoprubart in adult subjects with ALS. Fifty-four subjects with ALS were enrolled into the study in the United States and Canada at 13 ALS treatment sites. Ascending doses of tegoprubart were administered as IV infusions to four sequentially enrolling cohorts. The first two cohorts consisted of nine participants, and the last two cohorts of 18 participants each. All enrolled subjects received six infusions of tegoprubart over a 12 week period. Blood samples for target engagement, and exploratory biomarkers for inflammation and neurodegeneration were taken and analyzed. Participant-focused clinical outcomes were also assessed. In May 2022, we completed the Phase 2a study and released positive topline results. Tegoprubart successfully met the primary endpoints of safety and tolerability. Fifty of the fifty-four subjects completed all six study infusions, and adverse events were typical of an ALS patient population. Tegoprubart was well-tolerated, and no drug-related serious adverse events were observed. No new safety signals emerged. Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were present in less than 5 percent of samples. All ADAs were of low titer and did not impact tegoprubart drug levels. Tegoprubart target engagement was demonstrated in all dose cohorts with increasing target engagement in a dose-dependent manner, plateauing at the 4 and 8 mg / kg dosing levels using CD40L and CXCL13 biomarkers related to T cell and B cell function, respectively. Tegoprubart exposure decreased inflammatory biomarker levels, in a dose dependent manner, in 20 of 32 pro-inflammatory proteins. Pro-inflammatory biomarkers reduced included biomarkers also associated with IgA nephropathy and kidney transplant rejection, such as IgA, IgE, IgM, C3, CXCL9, and CXCL10. 
 We are seeking to further progress ALS clinical development and plan to work with key stakeholders on potential next steps to do so. However, we will be unable to continue our clinical development of tegoprubart for people with ALS without additional financing specific for our ALS program, and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all. 
 Clinical Development of Tegoprubart for IgA Nephropathy 
 In January 2023, the Company announced the deprioritization of its IgAN program and all IgAN clinical development activities were discontinued in 2023. IgAN is the leading cause of chronic glomerulonephritis, a state of inflammation producing damage to the filtering part of the kidney. Disease manifestation and clinical presentation involves renal dysfunction characterized by proteinuria with a slow relentless course. Approximately 30 -40 of persons living with IgAN ultimately reach end stage renal disease (ESRD). The standard of care for ESRD is dialysis or kidney transplant, which represents a significant economic burden as well as a major impact on a patient s quality of life. With an estimated prevalence of approximately 150,000 persons in the United States, IgAN is one of the most common autoimmune glomerulonephropathies. In the United States, oral budesonide Tarpeyo was approved for use in IgAN by the FDA in December 2021 and Kinpeygo received conditional approval by the European Medicines Agency EMA in July 2022. 
 In August 2022, we received IND clearance from the FDA to evaluate tegoprubart for the treatment of IgAN. The Phase 2 global study was a 96-week open-label, dose ranging trial, and included both a high dose and a low dose cohort. The primary endpoint was change in urinary protein:creatinine ratio at week twenty-four. Secondary endpoints included change in estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) at week 96 as well as safety and tolerability. The first subject was dosed in May 2022. 
 In January 2023, we announced the deprioritization of our IgAN program to focus resources on our kidney transplantation programs. We reported interim safety data from the Phase 2 high dose cohort in March 2023. All IgAN clinical development activities were discontinued in 2023.

 Market Trends and Uncertainties 
 The global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has recently experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, increases in inflation rates, elevated interest rates and uncertainty about economic stability. Likewise, the current conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have created extreme volatility in the global capital markets and global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain and energy markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn or continued volatility in the financial and credit markets could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. The severity and duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted. Any such failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies or cause us to delay our clinical development plans, research and development programs or commercialization efforts, out-license intellectual property rights to our product candidates or sell unsecured assets, or a combination of the above. Any of these actions could materially harm our business. 
 Any of the foregoing items could materially affect our business, possibly to a significant degree. The severity and duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional information. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and 
 35 

liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In Part II, Item 7 of our Amended Form 10-K, we disclosed our critical accounting estimates, which are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to those disclosed in the Amended Form 10-K.

 Sources of Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 78.2 million, working capital of 69.0 million and an accumulated deficit of 311.0 million. 
 We do not have any approved products for commercial sale and have never generated revenue from product sales and have incurred significant net losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur net operating losses for the foreseeable future. We do not expect to receive any revenue from any product candidates that we develop unless and until we obtain 
 37 

regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates or enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. To date, our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds from the sale of preferred and common stock, and the sale of warrants. Additionally, in view of our expectation to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future we will be required to raise additional capital resources in the future in order to fund our operations, although the availability of, and our access to, such resources is not assured. 
 2023 Securities Purchase Agreement 
 On July 8, 2024, the Second Closing occurred and we received gross proceeds of 2.1 million, or net proceeds of approximately 2.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, in exchange for 909,088 shares of common stock. 
 On September 30, 2024 and October 1, 2024, the Third Closing occurred and the Company received gross proceeds of 4.0 million, or net proceeds of approximately 3.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, in exchange for 1,727,400 shares of common stock. 
 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement 
 On May 6, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement and issued 13,110,484 shares of common stock at a price of 2.37 per share and pre-funded warrants which are exercisable to purchase 7,989,516 shares of common stock at a price of 2.369 per underlying share. We received net proceeds of 48.1 million from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. 
 2024 Underwriting Agreement 
 On October 29, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Underwriting Agreement and issued 18,356,173 shares of common stock at a price of 3.65 per share and pre-funded warrants which are exercisable to purchase 4,931,507 shares of common stock at a price of 3.649 per underlying share. We received net proceeds of 79.5 million from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. 
 Based on our liquidity estimates and our current resources, we have concluded that we have sufficient cash resources to meet our anticipated cash needs through at least the next 12 months from the date of this report and for the foreseeable future. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available resources sooner than we currently expect. To finance our operations beyond that point we will need to raise additional capital, which cannot be assured. Further, from time to time, our operating plans may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs for clinical studies sooner than planned or to fund additional clinical studies. For example, we do not currently have sufficient liquidity to fund the continued clinical development of tegoprubart for people with ALS without additional financing. We will continue to monitor our liquidity position in light of various financing alternatives and may pursue additional financing or other alternatives to allow us to continue our product development. However, there can be no assurance such financing or other alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, which could force us to significantly alter our business strategy, substantially curtail our current operations, or liquidate and cease operations altogether 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist of clinical research and development expenses, manufacturing expenses, legal and compliance expenses, compensation and related expenses, and general overhead costs. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay or prepay these expenses. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations, including commitments for capital expenditures, as disclosed under Liquidity and Capital Resources Material Cash Requirements in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Amended Form 10-K. 
 We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we expand our clinical program with tegoprubart, continue the research and development of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. 
 38 

We will continue to require additional financing in order to advance our drug product through clinical development, to manufacture, obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our product candidates, to develop, acquire or in-license other potential product candidates, and to fund operations for the foreseeable future. Therefore, we will seek to raise additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potentially collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. Our ability to raise substantial additional capital will depend on many factors, including: 
 the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of our ongoing and future clinical trials of tegoprubart, including as such activities may be adversely impacted by global events or macroeconomic conditions; 

the impact of global macroeconomic trends and uncertainties, which continue to experience extreme volatility and disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, increases in inflation rates, rising interest rates and uncertainty about economic stability; 

the number and scope of indications we decide to pursue for tegoprubart development; 

the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory review of any biologics license application, or BLA, we may submit for tegoprubart; 

the costs and timing of manufacturing for tegoprubart, if approved; 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the development of tegoprubart; 

the costs associated with being a public company; 

the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements; 

the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; and 

the cost associated with commercializing tegoprubart, if approved for commercial sale. 

Conditions in the financial and credit markets may also limit the availability of funding or increase the cost of funding. As a result of any of the foregoing factors, adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms on a timely basis, or at all. The severity and duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted. Any such failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies or cause us to delay our clinical development plans, research and development programs or commercialization efforts, out-license intellectual property rights to our product candidates or sell unsecured assets, or a combination of the above. Any of these actions could materially harm our business. The issuance of shares of common stock in the 2023 Private Placement, the 2024 Private Placement and the 2024 Underwriting Agreement diluted the ownership interests of our existing stockholders, and to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities in the future, our stockholders ownership interests may be further diluted, and the terms of these securities may also include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders rights. Debt financing, if available, would result in fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise funds through collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Please see the section of this Quarterly Report titled Risk Factors for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements and the challenges we may face in raising capital.

Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities used 28.3million in cash, primarily reflecting our net income of 8.4 million. Operating activities included adjustments for certain non-cash charges, including 51.8 million due to changes in warrant liabilities and fair value of financial instruments issued in excess of proceeds, and 1.9 million from accretion of investment discounts. These were partially offset by 6.5 million in stock-based compensation, and 0.3 million in operating lease amortization. Net operating assets and liabilities changed by 10.2 million, driven by an 8.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, a 1.7 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a 0.2 million increase in operating lease liabilities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating activities used 30.4 million in cash, primarily reflecting our net loss of 86.4 million. Operating activities include adjustments for certain non-cash charges including 55.7 million due to changes in warrant liabilities and fair value of financial instruments issued in excess of proceeds, 4.8 million in stock-based compensation, and 0.3 million in operating lease amortization, partially offset by 0.6 million in accretion of investment discounts. Net operating assets and liabilities changed by 4.2 million, driven by a 3.6 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, a 0.3 million increase in operating lease liabilities, and a 0.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.9 million. This consisted of 83.4 million used to purchase available-for-sale short-term investments, partially offset by 60.4 million in proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale short-term investments. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 55.4 million. This consisted of 60.4 million used to purchase available-for-sale short-term investments, partially offset by 5.0 million in proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale short-term investments. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted of the following: 48.1 million in net proceeds from the 2024 Private Placement, involving the sale of 13.1 million shares of common stock and 8.0 million pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock; 2.0 million in net proceeds from the Second Closing, involving the sale of 909,088 shares of common stock; and 3.3 million in net proceeds from the Third Closing, involving the sale of 1.5 million shares of common stock. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisted of the 2023 Private Placement, totaling 33.0 million in net proceeds from the sale of 8.7 million shares of common stock and 6.4 million pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Per 229.305 of Regulation S-K, the Company, designated a Smaller Reporting Company as defined in 229.10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, is not required to provide the disclosure required by this Item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of September 30, 2024 due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 In the course of preparing the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, our management concluded that the Common Warrants and Subsequent Closing Warrants do not meet the conditions to be classified as equity instruments under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own Equity, and must instead be recorded as liabilities on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at their fair value and remeasured at fair value for each subsequent reporting period. In light of this determination, on August 13, 2024, management and the audit committee of our Board of Directors together concluded that our previously issued (i) audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 28, 2023 and (ii) unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for (a) the three months ended March 31, 2024 included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 15, 2024, (b) the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 9, 2023 and (c) the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 10, 2023 (together, the Impacted Reports were each materially misstated. 
 As a result, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, determined that there existed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to our accounting for equity instruments for the periods covered by each of the Impacted Reports. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in the internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis. Specifically, our management determined that we did not maintain effective controls to timely identify and account for complex derivative type financial instruments. This material weakness resulted in the material misstatement of each of the Impacted Reports and, if not remediated, could result in further material misstatements to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Due to this material weakness, our management re-assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023. 
 Remediation of Material Weakness 
 Management has implemented remediation steps to address the material weakness described above and to improve our internal control over financial reporting. While we have processes to properly identify and evaluate the appropriate accounting technical pronouncements and other literature for all significant or unusual transactions, we are improving these processes to ensure that the nuances of such transactions are effectively evaluated in the context of the increasingly complex 
 41 

accounting standards. Specifically, we have increased our access to accounting literature and research materials, and have consulted with more third-party professionals regarding complex accounting matters than we have done previously. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Other than as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 42 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries is a party to, and none of their respective property is the subject of, any material legal proceeding, although we are from time-to-time party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors 
 An investment in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other public filings. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. You should consider all of the risk factors described in our public filings when evaluating our business. 
 Risks Related to Our Operations 
 Our short operating history and shifts in our business strategy may make it difficult to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability. 
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. Our ongoing operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing the Company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing technology, identifying potential product candidates and pursuing nonclinical and clinical trials. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully manufacture drug product in large enough quantities and with stability to support additional clinical trials, execute pivotal clinical trials, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. It can take many years to develop a new medicine from the time it is discovered to when it is available for treating patients. Consequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability based on our short operating history to date may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. In addition, as a result of the acquisition of Anelixis and our decision to discontinue our Company funding of the islet cell transplantation program and the IgAN program, our future business, prospects, financial position and operating results could be significantly different than those in historical periods or previously projected by our management. 
 In addition, as an early-stage business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. To successfully market any of our current or future product candidates, we will need to transition from a company with a clinical development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition. 
 We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and expect that we will continue to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability. 
 We have incurred significant annual net operating losses in every year since our inception. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other general and administrative expenses related to our ongoing operations. If tegoprubart or any future product candidates we develop are not successfully developed and approved, we may never generate any revenue from sales of products. The Company has experienced recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since its inception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 78.2 million, working capital of 69.0 million and an accumulated deficit of 311.0 million. We have not generated any revenues from product sales, have not completed the development of any product candidate and may never have a product candidate approved for commercialization. We expect it will be several years, if ever, before we have a product candidate ready for commercialization. We have financed our operations to date primarily through the sale of preferred and common stock, and the sale of warrants and have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical studies and our clinical trials. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and will depend, in part, on the rate at which we incur expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital. 
 43 

We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant expenses as we: 
 conduct nonclinical and clinical development of our product candidates or any future product candidate; 

seek to identify and acquire additional product candidates; 

acquire or in-license other products and technologies; 

enter into collaboration arrangements with regards to product discovery or development; 

develop manufacturing processes; 

seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval; 

maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

hire additional personnel; 

add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and 

operate as a public company. 

To become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize a product or products with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining marketing approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in these activities, including if we do not have available financial resources to allow us to pursue clinical trials and other clinical development activities, and, even if we are successful, we may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the Company, could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our nonclinical and clinical development efforts, and expand our business or continue our operations and may require us to raise additional capital that may dilute the ownership interest of common stockholders. A decline in the value of the Company could also cause stockholders to lose all or part of their investment. 
 We will require additional funding to be able to complete the development of our lead drug candidate. If we are unable to raise capital, we will be forced to significantly alter our business strategy, substantially curtail our current operations, or liquidate and cease operations altogether. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were 41,183,102 shares of our common stock outstanding. In connection with the closing of the 2024 Private Placement on May 9, 2024, we issued 13,110,484 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 7,989,516 shares of common stock to the investors therein. In connection with the completion of the Second Closing on July 8 2024, we issued 909,088 shares of our common stock and with the completion of the Third Closing on September 30, 2024 and October 1, 2024, we issued 1,727,400 shares of our common stock to the investors therein. In connection with the closing of the 2024 Underwriting Agreement on October 29, 2024, we issued 18,356,173 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 4,931,507 shares of our common stock to the investors therein. In view of our expectation to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, we will be required to raise additional capital resources in the future in order to fund our operations. We can also provide no assurance that other funding will be available to us, will be obtained on terms favorable to us or will provide us with sufficient funds to meet our objectives. If we are unable to raise such capital, or if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms, we will be forced to significantly alter our business strategy, substantially curtail our current operations, or liquidate and cease operations altogether. For example, we are currently unable to continue our clinical development of tegoprubart for people with ALS without additional financing, and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all. 
 Our funding needs may fluctuate significantly based on a number of factors, such as: 
 the scope, progress, results and costs of formulation development and manufacture of drug product to support nonclinical and clinical development of our product candidates; 

the extent to which we enter into additional collaboration arrangements regarding product discovery or development, or acquire or in-license products or technologies; 

44 

our ability to establish additional collaborations with favorable terms, if at all; 

the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 

the costs of future commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 

revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval; and 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims. 

Identifying potential product candidates and conducting formulation development, nonclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Even if we generate positive clinical data or are able to successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates, additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. 
 In addition to the dilution of our current stockholders ownership as a result of the 2023 Private Placement, the 2024 Private Placement and the 2024 Underwriting Agreement, we currently have a significant number of securities outstanding that are exercisable for our common stock, which could result in significant additional dilution and downward pressure on our stock price. Future issuances of our common stock, including common stock that may be issuable pursuant to outstanding warrants or other convertible securities, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were 41,183,102 shares of our common stock outstanding. In connection with the closing of the 2024 Private Placement on May 9, 2024, we issued 13,110,484 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 7,989,516 shares of common stock to the investors therein. In connection with the completion of the Second Closing on July 8 2024, we issued 909,088 shares of our common stock and the completion of the Third Closing on September 30, 2024 and October 1, 2024, we issued 1,727,400 shares of our common stock to the investors therein. In connection with the closing of the 2024 Underwriting Agreement on October 29, 2024, we issued 18,356,173 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 4,931,507 shares of our common stock to the investors therein. The issuance of shares of common stock in the 2023 Private Placement, the 2024 Private Placement and the 2024 Underwriting Agreement diluted the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. The issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of pre-funded warrants or common warrants issued in the initial closing of the 2023 Private Placement, the pre-funded warrants issued in the 2024 Private Placement and the pre-funded warrants issued in the 2024 Underwriting Agreement would result in significant additional dilution to our current stockholders, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the terms on which we could raise additional capital. If we sell additional shares of common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of our common stock. 
 Our product candidates are in the early stages of clinical development and may not be successfully developed. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize these or any other product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. 
 We currently do not have any products that have gained regulatory approval. We have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our lead drug candidate tegoprubart, including funding nonclinical studies, clinical trials, drug formulation and the manufacturing of clinical trial materials. Our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for several years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more drug candidates. As a result, our business is substantially depending on our ability to successfully complete the development of and obtain approval for one of our potential future additional product candidates. 
 45 

We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the pharmaceutical area. For example, to execute our business plan, we will need to successfully: 
 obtain additional financing in order to advance our drug product through clinical development, and to manufacture, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates; 

execute formulation, manufacturing, clinical, and nonclinical development activities; 

manufacture drug product at commercial scale; 

establish and confirm commercially acceptable stability (shelf-life) of our drug products; 

in-license or acquire other product candidates and advance them through clinical development; 

obtain required regulatory approvals for the development and commercialization of tegoprubart or other product candidates; 

maintain, leverage, and expand our intellectual property portfolio; 

build and maintain robust sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with strategic partners; 

gain market acceptance for any approved and marketed drug products; 

obtain and maintain adequate product pricing and reimbursement; 

develop and maintain any strategic relationships we elect to enter; and 

manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to product manufacturing, nonclinical development, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, post-marketing commitments, and commercialization. 

If we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our or other product candidates, and our business will suffer. 
 Public health crises, including pandemics or epidemics could adversely affect our business. 
 Our business and operations, including but not limited to ongoing or planned research and development activities may be impacted by public health crises. For example, our business was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also caused significant disruption in the operations of third parties upon whom we rely. Other future public health crises, including any future pandemics or epidemics could have a similar impact on our business. We have experienced, and may in the future experience disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or from another public health crisis, including any future pandemic or epidemic, that could severely impact our operations and development activities, including, but not limited to: 
 delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees; 

delays in manufacturing of our drug candidates due to increased competition for manufacturing capacity as a result of the pandemic; 

limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our development activities, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; 

refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies; 

delays in procuring drug substance and/or in manufacturing drug product due to limitations in employee resources or forced furloughs at our contract manufacturing organizations; 

delays in initiation of future clinical trials, including delays in receiving authorization from local regulatory authorities to initiate such clinical trials; and 

delays or disturbances in enrollment and trial execution, for example, because clinical trial sites may be unable to operate normally, or patients may elect to forego visits to medical facilities or undertake voluntary medical procedures. 

46 

Any of the foregoing factors, or other effects of any public health crisis, including any future pandemic or epidemic, could materially affect our business, possibly to a significant degree. The severity and duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted. 
 Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The global economy, including the financial and credit markets, continues to experience extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, increases in inflation rates, rising interest rates and uncertainty about economic stability. Likewise, the current conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have created extreme volatility in the global capital markets and global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain and energy markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn or continued volatility in the financial and credit markets could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. The severity and duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted. Any such failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies or cause us to delay our clinical development plans, research and development programs or commercialization efforts, out-license intellectual property rights to our product candidates or sell unsecured assets, or a combination of the above. Any of these actions could materially harm our business. For example, we do not currently have sufficient liquidity to fund the continued clinical development of tegoprubart for people with ALS without additional financing, notwithstanding the positive topline results of our Phase 2a study of tegoprubart for adult subjects with ALS. In addition, if we are unable to raise capital, we will be forced to significantly alter our business strategy, substantially curtail our current operations, or liquidate and cease operations altogether. 
 In addition, inflation has recently increased throughout the U.S. economy. As a result of inflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience cost increases, including costs of clinical trials and research and development of our product candidates, production costs, the price of labor, administration and other costs of doing business. Although we may continue to take measures to mitigate the impact of this inflation, if these measures are not effective, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Further, in an inflationary environment, cost increases may outpace our expectations, causing us to use our cash and other liquid assets faster than forecasted. If this happens, we may need to raise more capital to fund our operations than expected, and such capital may not be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms, if at all. 
 Adverse conditions in the financial markets, including bank failures, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance. 
 We currently maintain domestic cash deposits, for short term operating requirements, in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured banks, which exceed the FDIC insurance limits. Our additional cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of primarily of cash invested in money market funds and government bonds. Bank failures, events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, or concerns or rumors about such events, may lead to widespread demands for customer withdrawals and liquidity constraints that may result in market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank failed and was taken into receivership by the FDIC. At that time, we maintained deposits amounting to approximately 78 of our total cash at Silicon Valley Bank. On March 26, 2023, the assets, deposits and loans of Silicon Valley Bank were acquired by First-Citizens Bank Trust Company. In response to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, we diversified our cash deposits into money market funds, U.S. treasuries and U.S. government agency securities and, as of the date of this report, our total cash maintained in FDIC insured banking accounts is less than 3 of our total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact our liquidity and financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other comparable insurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. or any applicable foreign government in the future or that any bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a future failure or liquidity crisis. Additionally, our cash investments outside of FDIC insured bank accounts are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we are required to write down the value of the investment, which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition and could limit our access to liquidity.

Drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, including failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the formulation and commercialization of our product candidates. 
 Given the early stage of development for our product candidates, the risk of failure is high. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must conduct nonclinical trials, and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Formulation and device development, nonclinical and clinical testing are all expensive activities, difficult to design and implement, and can take years to complete. Failure can occur at any time during the development program, including during the clinical trial process. Further, the results of nonclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates, as well as earlier generation formulations may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in nonclinical and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. There is a risk that additional nonclinical and/or clinical safety studies will be required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States and/or that subsequent studies will not match results seen in prior studies. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective, safe and well-tolerated in humans or will receive regulatory approval. 
 We may experience delays in our clinical trials, and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin or enroll subjects on time, need to be redesigned or be completed on schedule, if at all. There can be no assurance that the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies will approve investigational new drug applications and allow us to start clinical trials for any of our product candidates in the future, including for islet cell transplant. Once a clinical trial has commenced, there is also no assurance that the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory body will not put any of our product candidates on clinical hold. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates. Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or prematurely terminated for a variety of reasons, such as: 
 delay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority on a trial design that we want to execute; 

delay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical trial; 

delays in reaching, or failure to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites; 

delays in completing formulation development and manufacturing as a prerequisite to commencing clinical work; 

inability, delay, or failure in identifying and maintaining a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical programs; 

delay or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable subjects to participate in a trial; 

delay or failure in having subjects complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up; 

clinical sites and investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial; 

lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical trials and increased expenses associated with the services of our contract research organizations CROs and other third parties; 

clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs; 

the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; 

we may experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients that our product candidates are designed to target; 

48 

our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all; 

we may have difficulty partnering with experienced CROs and study sites that can identify patients that our product candidates are designed to target and run our clinical trials effectively; 

regulators or IRBs may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; 

the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; 

the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; or 

there may be changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions. In addition, our development and commercialization activities could be harmed or delayed by a shutdown of the U.S. government, including the FDA. For example, a prolonged shutdown may significantly delay the FDA's ability to timely review and process any submissions we may file or cause other regulatory delays, which could materially and adversely affect our business. 

If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive, or if there are safety concerns, we may: 
 be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates; 

not obtain marketing approval at all; 

obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired; 

obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings that would reduce the potential market for our products or inhibit our ability to successfully commercialize our products; 

be subject to additional post-marketing restrictions and/or testing requirements; or 

have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval. 

Our product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our nonclinical studies or clinical trials will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant nonclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. 
 If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented and expenses for the development of our product candidates could increase. 
 We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy. We do not know whether the ongoing or planned clinical trials will enroll subjects in a timely fashion, require redesign of essential trial elements or be completed on its projected schedule. In addition, competitors may have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that treat related or the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors product candidates. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. 
 Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including: 
 the eligibility criteria for the study in question; 

the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study; 

the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials; 

49 

the inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same disease indication; 

the patient referral practices of physicians; 

the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; 

ambiguous or negative interim results of our clinical trials, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results; 

feedback from regulatory authorities, IRBs, ethics committees ECs ), or data safety monitoring boards, or results from earlier stage or concurrent nonclinical and clinical trials, that might require modifications to the protocol; 

decisions by regulatory authorities, IRBs, ECs, or the Company, or recommendations by data safety monitoring boards, to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason; and 

unacceptable risk-benefit profile or unforeseen safety issues or adverse effects. 

Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of the Company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. 
 Our ability to conduct clinical trials in some jurisdictions outside of the United States may be adversely affected. 
 We currently have clinical trial sites in regions outside the United States, including Asia, the European Union and the United Kingdom, and we will continue to conduct future clinical trials in these markets. Our ability to conduct clinical trials at sites located outside the United States is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in jurisdictions outside the United States, including: 
 difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with qualified CROs, physicians and clinical trial sites; 

different local standards for the conduct of clinical trials; 

difficulty in complying with various and complex import laws and regulations when shipping drugs to certain countries; 

the potential burden of complying with a variety of laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatments; 

lack of consistency in standard of care from country to country; 

diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries; 

instability in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession and actual or anticipated military conflicts, social upheaval or political uncertainty; 

foreign exchange fluctuations; 

cultural differences in medical practice and clinical research; and 

changes in country or regional regulatory requirements. 

The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the resulting imposition of economic and other sanctions by the United States, European Union and many other nations on Russia, individuals in Russia, Russian businesses and the Russian central bank, or any escalation of tensions in the region, could have a broader impact that expands into other countries. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East could have similar impacts. Although the length and impact of any military action and expansion of the conflict into other countries are highly unpredictable, if either conflict spreads or has effects on additional countries, we may experience disruptions or delays in our plans to conduct clinical trial activities in affected regions outside the United States. 
 If serious adverse events or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may need to abandon or limit our development of some of our product candidates . 
 If our product candidates are associated with undesirable effects in nonclinical or clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to interrupt, delay or abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more 
 50 

acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Any occurrences of clinically significant adverse events with our product candidates may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. 
 Tegoprubart is an early product candidate, and the side effect profile in humans has not been fully established. Currently unknown, drug-related side effects may be identified through ongoing and future clinical trials and, as such, these possible drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment, the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial, or result in potential product liability claims. 
 Our future success depends on our ability to retain executives and key employees and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel in the future. 
 We are highly dependent on the product development, clinical and business development expertise of the principal members of our management, scientific and clinical team. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executives and key employees, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain key person insurance for any of our executives or other employees. Our recent decision to discontinue the islet cell transplantation program and IgAN program and uncertainties regarding our financial condition may increase the likelihood that employees depart in the foreseeable future. 
 Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing, sales and marketing personnel is critical to our success. Due to the small size of the Company and the limited number of employees, each of our executives and key employees serves in a critical role. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of, and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating drug product, nonclinical development, clinical development, regulatory strategy, and commercial strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to provide services to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited. 
 
 Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Compliance Matters 
 If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, or the approvals may be for a narrow indication, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue may be materially impaired. 
 Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to a new drug application in the United States and by other regulatory authorities outside the United States prior to commercialization in the respective regions. The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and outside the United States, is expensive and takes several years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received approval to market any of our product candidates from regulatory authorities in any country. We have no experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals for our products and may engage third-party consultants to assist in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive nonclinical and clinical data, and other supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product formulation and manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional nonclinical, clinical or other data. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from nonclinical and clinical trials could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, 
 51 

or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may also cause delays in or prevent the approval of an application. 
 Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be for fewer or more limited indications than requested or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable or its market potential significantly impaired. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. 
 In order to market and sell our products in the EU and other international jurisdictions outside of the United States, we or our third-party collaborators must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and may require additional nonclinical, clinical or health outcome data. In addition, the time required to obtain approval may differ substantially amongst international jurisdictions. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition to regulatory approval, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. 
 If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired. 
 Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to extensive post-marketing regulatory requirements and could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved. 
 Our product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their testing, manufacture, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation that are specific to those defined by regulatory authorities in the countries where the product is approved. In the United States and other countries that follow the International Conference on Harmonization, these requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, including periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. 
 The FDA, or other regulatory authorities, may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers communications regarding use of their products and if we promote our products beyond their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label promotion. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws. 
 In addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including: 
 restrictions on such products, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes; 

restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product; 

restrictions on product distribution or use; 

requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials; 

warning or untitled letters; 

withdrawal of the products from the market; 

refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit; 

recall of products; 

52 

fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues; 

suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals; 

refusal to permit the import or export of our products; 

product seizure; or 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

Non-compliance with EU requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with the EU s requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. 
 Legislation regulating the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain. 
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes intended to contain healthcare costs and modify the regulation of drug and biologic products. These and other regulatory changes could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. 
 For example, on August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, includes policies that are designed to have a direct impact on drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government, which shall take effect in 2023. The Inflation Reduction Act requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates to Medicare if they increase prices faster than inflation for certain drugs used by Medicare beneficiaries. The mechanics of the rebate calculation would mimic those of the Medicaid rebate, but the expansion of inflation-based rebates may further complicate pricing strategies. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 or other similar legislation could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and reimbursement we receive for our products, thereby reducing our profitability. 
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures and regulations will be adopted in the future. Any of these measures and regulations could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures and affect our product development, testing, marketing approvals and post-market activities. 
 Laws, restrictions, and other regulatory measures are also imposed by healthcare laws and regulations in international jurisdictions and in those jurisdictions we face the same issues as in the United States regarding difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval and commercialization of our product candidates and which may affect the prices we may obtain. 
 In some countries, particularly the countries of the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed, possibly materially. 
 Our business operations and relationships with healthcare providers, physicians, third-party payers, and customers will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other broadly applicable healthcare laws, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, program exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings. 
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payers will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell and distribute the products for which we receive marketing approval. Even though we will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers, federal and state healthcare laws are and will be applicable to our business. Such laws include, but are not limited to federal false claims, false statements and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False 
 53 

Claims Act FCA ), the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA ), patient data privacy and security regulation, including, in the United States, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Clinical Health Act of 2009 HITECH ), the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and analogous state, local or foreign law. 
 Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of promotional and marketing activities, such as: providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program to reduce liability for Medicaid rebates. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, that person or entity may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. 
 Laws, restrictions, and other regulatory measures are also imposed by anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, and other healthcare laws and regulations in international jurisdictions, and in those jurisdictions we face the same issues as in the United State regarding exposure to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, program exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and future earnings. 
 We depend on our information systems and those of our third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants. Our information systems, or those of our third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer cybersecurity incidents, which could result in a material disruption of our development programs or loss of data or compromise the privacy, security, integrity or confidentiality of sensitive information related to our business and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. Our information systems and infrastructure, and those of our current or future third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from cybersecurity incidents, including computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, phishing and other social engineering attacks, unauthorized access or use resulting from malware, as well as disruptions due to natural disasters, terrorism, war, mistakes or technical errors, including due to software updates and telecommunication and electrical failures. We may also experience cybersecurity incidents stemming from persons inside our organizations (including employees or contractors), or other persons with access to information systems inside our organization. Attacks on information systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and they are being conducted by increasingly sophisticated and organized foreign governments, groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. In addition to extracting or accessing sensitive information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. The prevalent use of mobile devices that access sensitive information also increases the risk of data security incidents which could lead to the loss of confidential information or other intellectual property. Information system disruptions, even if inadvertent, may limit or disable our access or important third parties access to our systems. While to our knowledge we have not experienced any material information system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations or the operations of third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and significant reputational, financial, legal, regulatory, business or operational harm. The costs to us to mitigate, investigate and respond to potential security incidents, breaches, disruptions, network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information systems, our efforts to address 
 54 

these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. 
 For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any real or perceived security breach affects our information systems (or those of our third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants), or results in the loss of or accidental, unlawful or unauthorized access to, use of, release of, or other processing of personally identifiable information or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could be found to have violated applicable U.S. and international privacy, data protection and other laws, which could subject us to litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state and local regulatory entities in the U.S. and by international regulatory entities, resulting in exposure to material civil and/or criminal liability. and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. Such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various foreign, domestic (federal and state) privacy and security laws, if applicable, including HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing rules and regulations, as well as regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to cybersecurity incidents. 
 Any failure or perceived failure by us or any third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants to comply with our privacy, confidentiality, data security or similar obligations, or any data security incidents or other security breaches that result in the accidental, unlawful or unauthorized access to, use of, release of, processing of, or transfer of sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, may result in negative publicity, harm to our reputation, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation or public statements against us, could cause third parties to lose trust in us or could result in claims by third parties, including those that assert that we have breached our privacy, confidentiality, data security or similar obligations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. To the extent we maintain individually identifiable health information, we could be subject to fines and penalties (including civil and criminal) under HIPAA for any failure by us or our business associates to comply with HIPAA s requirements. Moreover, data security incidents and other security breaches can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm. While we have implemented data security measures intended to protect our information, data, information systems, applications and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent service interruptions or cybersecurity incidents. 
 European data collection is governed by restrictive regulations governing the collection, use, processing and cross-border transfer of personal information. 
 We may collect, process, use or transfer personal information from individuals located in the European Economic Area in connection with our business, including in connection with conducting clinical trials in the EEA. Additionally, if any of our product candidates are approved, we may seek to commercialize those products in the European Economic Area. The collection and use of personal health data in the European Economic Area is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (the GDPR ), along with other European Union and country-specific laws and regulations. The United Kingdom and Switzerland have also adopted data protection laws and regulations. These legislative acts (together with regulations and guidelines) impose requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal data relating to identifiable individuals and transferring such data outside of the European Economic Area, including to the United States, providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal data, keeping personal data secure, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal data, responding to individuals requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal data, reporting security breaches involving personal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals, appointing data protection officers or corporate representatives, conducting data protection impact assessments and record-keeping. The GDPR imposes additional responsibilities and liabilities in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and related national data protection laws of the member states of the European Economic Area and other states in the European Economic Area may result in substantial fines, other administrative penalties and civil claims being brought against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and may impose additional requirements, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA or United Kingdom. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.

If we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business. 
 We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our nonclinical or clinical development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. 
 Risks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates 
 Even if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, we may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success. 
 If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, we may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers and others in the medical community. In addition, physicians, patients and third-party payers may prefer other novel products to ours. If our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including: 
 the efficacy and safety and potential advantages and disadvantages compared to alternative treatments; 

the ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices; 

the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments; 

the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; 

the strength of our marketing and distribution support; 

the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement, including patient cost-sharing programs such as copays and deductibles; 

the ability to develop or partner with third-party collaborators to develop companion diagnostics; 

the prevalence and severity of any side effects; and 

any restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications. 

If our current product candidates, or a future product candidate receives marketing approval and we, or others, later discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, our ability to market the product could be compromised. 
 Clinical trials are conducted in carefully defined subsets of patients who have agreed to enter into clinical trials. Consequently, it is possible that our clinical trials may indicate an apparent beneficial effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect in a broader patient population or alternatively fail to identify undesirable side effects. If, following approval of a product candidate, we, or others, discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, any of the following events could occur: 
 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or seize the product; 

the product may be required to be recalled or changes may be required to the way the product is administered; 

additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the product; 

regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a black box warning or a contraindication; 

the creation of a Medication Guide outlining the risks of the previously unidentified side effects for distribution to patients; 

additional restrictions may be imposed on the distribution or use of the product via a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy; 

we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; 

the product may become less competitive; and 

56 

our reputation may suffer. 

Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and business. The commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired. 
 We currently have no marketing or sales force. If we are unable to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to effectively market and sell our product candidates, if approved, or generate product revenues. 
 We currently do not have a marketing or sales team for the marketing, sales and distribution of any of our product candidates that are able to obtain regulatory approval. In order to commercialize any product candidates, we must build on a territory-by-territory basis marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. If our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we intend to establish an internal sales and marketing team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our product candidates, which will be expensive and time-consuming, will require significant attention of our executive officers to manage and may nonetheless fail to effectively market and sell our product candidates. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of any of our products that we obtain approval to market. With respect to the commercialization of all or certain of our product candidates, we may choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements when needed on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval, or any such commercialization may experience delays or limitations. If we are not successful in commercializing our product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer, and we may incur significant additional losses. 
 We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do. 
 The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we are developing our product candidates. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. 
 Specifically, there are a number of companies developing competing anti-CD40 and anti-CD40L therapeutics in clinical trials for transplant, autoimmune or central nervous system indications, including: Novartis, Sanofi, UCB, Amgen (post-acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics), Bristol Myers Squibb, and Kiniksa. All of these companies are larger than Eledon and have significantly greater resources to develop their drug candidates. 
 If approved, we expect that tegoprubart will face competition from numerous FDA-approved therapeutics for the prevention of transplant rejection, including PROGRAF , ASTAGRAF XL , ENVARSUS XR , NULOJIX , CELLCEPT , MYFORTIC , and numerous other branded and generic immunosuppressive agents. Multiple companies are working on islet cell and kidney transplant solutions that may ultimately potentially negate the need for immunosuppressive agents in these indications altogether. 
 We expect that tegoprubart will face competition from FDA-approved therapeutics for the treatment of ALS including RADICAVA , RELYVRIO , RILUZOLE, and numerous other branded and generic immunosuppressive agents. Multiple pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including but not limited to Biogen, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Orion Pharma, Orphazyme, AZTherapies, Voyager Therapeutics, Apic Bio, Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics, and Cytokinetics, are also working on competing ALS pharmaceutical, gene therapy and cell therapy approaches. 
 57 

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. 
 Generic products are currently available, with additional generic products expected to become available over the coming years, potentially creating pricing pressure. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, conducting nonclinical studies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 The insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly-approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue. 
 The availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payers is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. Sales of our product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and internationally, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payers. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. 
 There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly-approved products. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payers tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products. Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more conservative than CMS. Outside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits. 
 Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payers, in the United States and internationally, to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. Increased expense is incurred to cover costs of health outcome focused research used to generate data necessary to justify the value of our products in order to secure reimbursement. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products into the healthcare market. 
 58 

In addition, many private payers contract with commercial vendors who sell software that provide guidelines that attempt to limit utilization of, and therefore reimbursement for, certain products deemed to provide limited benefit to existing alternatives. Such organizations may set guidelines that limit reimbursement or utilization of our products. 
 Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop. 
 We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop; injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention; withdrawal of clinical trial participants; significant costs to defend the related litigation; substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; loss of revenue; reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop. 
 We currently hold 10.0 million in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of 10.0 million, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials or if we commence commercialization of our product candidates. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. 
 Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties 
 We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for nonclinical and clinical trials and expect to continue to do so for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products at an acceptable cost and quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts. 
 We have utilized, and intend to continue utilizing, third parties to formulate, manufacture, package, and distribute clinical supplies of our drug candidates. We have no experience in manufacturing and do not have any manufacturing facilities. Currently, we rely on third parties for the manufacturing of drug substance and drug product for nonclinical and clinical activities. Our manufacturing vendors utilize proprietary cell culture media, cell lines, buffers, manufacturing equipment, manufacturing supplies, and storage buffers for the manufacturing of tegoprubart and other product candidates. These materials are custom-made and available from only a limited number of sources. Although we believe that our third-party suppliers maintain a significant supply of these materials and equipment on hand, any sustained disruption in this supply, could adversely affect our operations. We do not have any long-term agreements in place with our current suppliers. If we are required to change manufacturers, we may experience delays associated with finding an alternate manufacturer that is properly qualified to produce supplies of our products and product candidates in accordance with regulatory requirements and our specifications. Any delays or difficulties in obtaining or in manufacturing, packaging or distributing approved product candidates could negatively impact our clinical trials. 
 We expect to rely on third-party manufacturers or third-party collaborators for the manufacture of commercial supply of any other product candidates for which our collaborators or we obtain marketing approval. Despite drug substance and product risk management, this reliance on third parties presents a risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts. For example, these third parties experienced disruptions in their operations in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic. Any delay or performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers of drug substance or drug products could delay clinical development or marketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. If suppliers cannot supply us with our requirements, we may be required to identify alternative manufacturers, which would lead us to incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement. 
 Formulations and devices used in early studies are not final formulations and devices for commercialization. Additional changes may be required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities on specifications and storage conditions. These may require additional studies and may result in a delay in our clinical trials and commercialization activities. 
 59 

We also expect to rely on other third parties to label, store, and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue. 
 We may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including: 
 reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance; 

the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party; 

the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and 

the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. 

The third parties we rely on for manufacturing and packaging are also subject to regulatory review, and any regulatory compliance problems with these third parties could significantly delay or disrupt our clinical or commercialization activities. Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products. Additionally, macro-economic conditions may adversely affect these third parties, causing them to suffer liquidity or operational problems. If a key third-party vendor becomes insolvent or is forced to lay off workers assisting with our projects, our results and development timing could suffer. 
 Our product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. 
 Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or products may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis. 
 We depend on CROs and other contracted third parties to perform nonclinical and clinical testing and certain other research and development activities. As a result, the outcomes of the activities performed by these organizations will be, to a certain extent, beyond our control. 
 The nature of outsourcing a substantial portion of our business will require that we rely on CROs and other contractors to assist us with research and development, clinical testing activities, patient enrollment, data collection, and regulatory submissions to the FDA or other regulatory bodies. As a result, our success will depend partially on the success of these third parties in performing their responsibilities. Although we intend to pre-qualify our CROs and other contractors and we believe that the contractors selected will be fully capable of performing their contractual obligations, we cannot directly control the adequacy and timeliness of the resources and expertise that they apply to these activities. Additionally, macro-economic conditions may affect our development partners and vendors, which could adversely affect their ability to timely perform their tasks. If our contractors do not perform their obligations in an adequate and timely manner, the pace of clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our drug candidates could be significantly delayed, and our prospects could be adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 
 If we are unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our technology and products or if the scope of the intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired. 
 Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in relevant countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications 
 60 

in the United States and internationally that are related to our novel technologies and product candidates. This patent portfolio includes issued patents and pending patent applications covering pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use. 
 The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions, and under the laws of certain jurisdictions, patents or other intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in scope. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our discovery and nonclinical development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. 
 The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, India and China do not allow patents for methods of treating the human body. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the EU, the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. 
 The risks described pertaining to our patents and other intellectual property rights also apply to the intellectual property rights that we license, and any failure to obtain, maintain and enforce these rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. In some cases, we may not have control over the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of the patents that we license, and our licensors may fail to take the steps that we believe are necessary or desirable in order to obtain, maintain and enforce the licensed patents. Any inability on our part to protect adequately our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position. 
 The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In certain situations, non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 In addition, we have acquired rights to tegoprubart and other product candidates through a license agreement with The ALS Therapy Development Institute, and may in the future enter into other license agreements with third parties for other intellectual property rights or assets. These license agreements may impose various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, we may be required to make certain payments to the licensor, we may lose the exclusivity of our license, or the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to develop or market products covered by the license. Additionally, the milestone and other payments associated with these licenses will make it less profitable for us to develop our drug candidates than if we had developed the licensed technology internally. 
 In some cases, patent prosecution of our licensed technology may be controlled solely by the licensor. If our licensors fail to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for the proprietary intellectual property we license from them, we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, and our competitors could market competing products using the intellectual property. In certain cases, we may control the prosecution of patents resulting from licensed technology. In the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution, we may incur significant liability to our licensing partners. If disputes over intellectual property and other rights that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates. 
 61 

We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful. 
 Our commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. 
 If we are found to infringe a third party s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. 
 Because competition in our industry is intense, competitors may infringe or otherwise violate our issued patents, patents of our licensors or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent s claims narrowly, or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. We may also elect to enter into license agreements in order to settle patent infringement claims or to resolve disputes prior to litigation, and any such license agreements may require us to pay royalties and other fees that could be significant. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. 
 We may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. 
 A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, that are important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. If we were not able to obtain a license or are not able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, possibly materially. 
 If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. 
 In addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. Any NDAs or similar agreements entered into by the Company may not be with all relevant parties, or adequately protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets. Moreover, to the extent we enter into such agreements, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate them, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed. 
 62 

We may be subject to claims of misappropriation of trade secrets from former employers of Company personnel. 
 Many of our employees and certain of our directors were previously employed at or affiliated with research foundations or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Although we try to ensure that our employees and directors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees or directors have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee s or director s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 We expect our stock price to be volatile, and the market price of our common stock may drop unexpectedly. 
 The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include: 
 uncertainties regarding our financial condition and our ability to raise sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations; 

our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates or other product candidates, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals; 

failure of any of our product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success; 

issues in manufacturing our approved products, if any, or product candidates; 

the results of our current and any future clinical trials of our product candidates; 

the entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key commercial partner agreements; 

the initiation of, material developments in, or conclusion of litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual property rights or defend against the intellectual property rights of others; 

announcements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress, or the lack thereof, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments; 

the introduction of technological innovations or new therapies that compete with our potential products; 

the loss of key employees; 

changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock; 

general and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our research and development expenditures; 

changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems; 

period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results; and 

future issuances of shares of common stock. 

Moreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. 
 In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation. 
 63 

If we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and our ability to operate our business could be harmed. 
 Ensuring that we will have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. 
 As described in Part 1, Item 4 of this report, we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses or otherwise successfully maintain internal controls over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting, and our stock price, may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the applicable stock exchange listing requirements. Additionally, as we become a larger company, we will become subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires our independent auditors to document and test our internal controls. These additional requirements are costly, and our auditors may identify control deficiencies. 
 Implementing any changes to our internal controls may distract the officers and employees of the Company, entail substantial costs to modify its existing processes and take significant time to complete. These changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of the internal controls of the Company, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase operating costs and harm the business. In addition, investors perceptions that the internal controls of the Company are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm the stock price of the Company. 
 Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of the Company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. 
 Provisions in our corporate charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of the Company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our Board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by stockholders to replace or remove the current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board. Among other things, these provisions: 
 establish a classified Board such that not all members of the Board are elected at one time; 

allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our Board; 

limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from our Board; 

establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our Board; 

require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent; 

limit who may call stockholder meetings; 

authorize our Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a poison pill that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board; and 

require the approval of the holders of at least 75 of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of the Company s charter or bylaws. 

We do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 
 We expect to retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain, if any, for any stockholders for the foreseeable future.
