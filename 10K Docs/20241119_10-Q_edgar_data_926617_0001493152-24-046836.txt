 (Unaudited) 

and working capital deficit of approximately as of September 30, 2024. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of and used cash in operations of . The Company
had a balance in cash and cash equivalents of as of September 30, 2024. The Company also expects to continue to incur a net
loss and negative cash flows from operations for the remainder of 2024. In order to fund operations, meet its capital requirements or
satisfy the anticipated obligations as they become due, the Company expects to take further action to protect its liquidity position,
which include, but are not limited to: 

Raising
 capital through equity or debt offerings either in the public markets or via private placement
 offering; to the extent that the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities,
 the Company s stockholders may experience significant dilution. However, no assurance
 can be given that capital will be available on acceptable terms, or at all; 

Securing
 debt, however, no assurance can be given that debt will be available on acceptable terms
 or at all; 

Reducing
 executive bonuses or replacing cash compensation with equity grants; 

Reducing
 professional services and consulting fees and eliminating non-critical projects; 

Reducing
 travel and entertainment expenses; and 

Reducing
 eliminating or deferring discretionary marketing programs. 

The
Company also has outstanding warrants to purchase shares of its common stock (the Common Stock that may be exercised although
there can be no assurance that the warrants will be exercised. 

There
can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flow from operations. Management expects
cash from product sales and licensing to be the Company s only material, recurring source of cash in 2024. Given the above conditions,
there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these consolidated
interim financial statements are filed. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties. 

On
July 1, 2024, the Company received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC Nasdaq notifying the
Company that, for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the deficiency letter, the Company s Market Value of
Listed Securities was below the minimum of 
million market cap requirement for continued inclusion on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) (the
 MVLS Requirement ). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), Nasdaq has provided the Company with 180
calendar days, or until December 30, 2024, to regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement. In the event the Company does not regain compliance prior to the December 30, 2024, the Company will receive written
notification that its securities are subject to delisting, at which point the Company may appeal the delisting determination. The Company
is evaluating potential actions to regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement and is actively monitoring the market value of its listed
securities. The Company may also, if appropriate, consider other options to regain compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing standard.
 There is no assurance that the Company
will be able to regain compliance by the December 30, 2024 deadline, and there is no assurance that the Company will otherwise
maintain compliance with this or any of the other Nasdaq continued listing requirements. 

On
October 17, 2024, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq indicating that the bid price for the Company s
common stock, for the last 30 consecutive business days, had closed below the minimum per share and, as a result, the Company is
not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for the continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has a period of 180 calendar days,
or until April 15, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of
the Common Stock must meet or exceed per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this 180-day period. If the
Company is not in compliance by April 15, 2025, the Company may qualify for a second 180 calendar day compliance period. If the Company
does not qualify for, or fails to regain compliance during the second compliance period, or if it appears to Nasdaq that the Company
will not be able to cure the deficiency, then Nasdaq will notify the Company of its determination to delist its Common Stock, at which
point the Company would have an option to appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. 

and , respectively, of adjustments to estimates of variable consideration to derecognize revenue for services
provided in a prior period. There were impairment losses on accounts receivable recorded during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024. 

The
Company has discontinued providing Aspira GenetiX, including genetics carrier screening, on the Aspira Synergy platform, effective September
30, 2022. 

Accounts
Receivable: Virtually all accounts receivable are derived from sales made to customers located in North America. The Company grants
credit to customers in the normal course of business and the resulting trade receivables are stated at their net realizable value. The
Company maintains an allowance for credit losses based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable, including the historical
collection cycle. Amounts are written off against the allowances for credit losses when the Company determines that a customer account
is not collectable. The Company believes its exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diversity of its payer base. 

. The of this standard did have a material impact
on its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 

In
June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject
to Contractual Sale Restrictions ASU 2022-03 to clarify guidance in Topic 820 on the fair value measurement of an
equity security that is subject to a contractual sale restriction and also requires specific disclosures related to an equity security.
ASU 2022-03 is scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early is permitted. The Company does expect a material impact as a result of this standard on its results of operations,
financial position, or cash flows. 

In
October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, D isclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC s Disclosure
Update and Simplification Initiative ASU 2023-06 ). The amendments in this ASU are expected to clarify or improve disclosure
and presentation requirements of a variety of ASC topics by aligning them with the SEC s regulations. ASU 2023-06 will become effective
for each amendment on the effective date of the SEC s corresponding disclosure rule changes. The Company does not expect ASU 2023-06
will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 to update reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant
segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance. This ASU requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that
are regularly provided to the Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM and included within the reported measure
of a segment s profit or loss, requires interim disclosures about a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets that are
currently required annually, requires disclosure of the position and title of the CODM, clarifies circumstances in which an entity can
disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, and contains other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-07 is scheduled to be effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The adoption of this standard
is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 

In
November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income Expense Disaggregation
Disclosures ASU 2024-03 to improve the disclosures around expenses. The update requires more detailed information
about purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and depletion) in commonly presented expense line items.
ASU 2024-03 is scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026. The Company is evaluating whether the adoption
of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

shares (the Modified Warrants ).
The terms of the remaining of the 2022 Warrants were unchanged (the Unmodified Warrants ). 

The
fair values of the Modified Warrants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were approximately 
and ,
respectively, after 
of the Modified Warrants with a fair value of

Risk-free interest rate 

Expected lives (years) 

Weighted average fair value 

The
2022 Warrants were deemed to be derivative instruments due to certain contingent put features. The fair value of the 2022 Warrants was
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, deemed to be an appropriate model due to the terms of the 2022 Warrants issued,
including a fixed term and exercise price. 

The
fair value of the 2022 Warrants was affected by changes in inputs to the Black-Scholes option pricing model including the Company s
stock price, expected stock price volatility, the contractual term, and the risk-free interest rate. This model uses Level 2 inputs,
including stock price volatility, in the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. The 2022 Warrants are classified
as a long-term liability on the Company s balance sheet. 

The
carrying value of the Company s insurance promissory note approximates fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
due to the short-term nature of the insurance note and is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 

The
DECD loan is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of
the DECD loan. The fair value of the DECD loan is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the prevailing market interest rates.

in the Company s personal and intellectual property. The DECD s security interest in the Company s intellectual property
may be subordinated to a qualified institutional lender. 

The
loan may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. An initial disbursement of Loan 1 was made to
the Company on April 15, 2016 under the DECD Loan Agreement. On December 3, 2020, the Company received a disbursement of the remaining
 Loan 2 under the DECD Loan Agreement, as the Company had achieved the target employment milestone necessary
to receive an additional under the DECD Loan Agreement and the DECD determined to fund the remaining under the
DECD Loan Agreement after concluding that the required revenue target would likely have been achieved in the first quarter of 2020 in
the absence of the impacts of COVID-19. 

Under
the terms of the DECD Loan Agreement, the Company was eligible for forgiveness of up to of the principal amount of the loan
if it was able to achieve certain job creation and retention milestones by December 31, 2022. On June 26, 2023, the Company was notified
by the DECD that the Company satisfied all job creation and retention requirements under the loan agreement to receive forgiveness of

If the Company fails to maintain its Connecticut operations through March 22, 2026, the DECD may require early repayment of a portion

180-day period. 

If
the Company is not in compliance by April 15, 2025, the Company may qualify for a second 180 calendar day compliance period. If the Company
does not qualify for, or fails to regain compliance during the second compliance period, or if it appears to Nasdaq that the Company
will not be able to cure the deficiency, then Nasdaq will notify the Company of its determination to delist its Common Stock, at which
point the Company would have an option to appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. There can be no assurance that
the Company will be successful in maintaining its listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.

Company
Overview 

Corporate
Vision 

We
are dedicated to the discovery, development, and commercialization of non-invasive, AI-powered tests to aid in the diagnosis of gynecologic
diseases, starting with ovarian cancer. 

We
plan to broaden our focus to the differential diagnosis of other gynecologic diseases that typically cannot be assessed through traditional
non-invasive clinical procedures. We expect to continue commercializing our existing and new technology and to distribute our tests through
our decentralized technology transfer service platform, Aspira Synergy. We also intend to continue to raise public awareness regarding
the higher sensitivity and negative predictive value for ovarian malignancy of Ova 1 as compared to cancer antigen 125 CA-125 on its own for women with adnexal masses planned for
surgery, as well as the performance of our machine learning algorithms in detecting ovarian cancer risk in different racial
and ethnic populations. We plan to continue to expand access to our tests among Medicaid patients as part of our corporate mission to
make the best care available to all women, and we plan to advocate for legislation and the adoption of our technology in professional
society guidelines to provide broad access to our products and services. 

We
continue to focus on three key initiatives: growth, innovation, and operational excellence. 

Growth .
As a revenue-generating diagnostics company focused exclusively on gynecologic disease, our commercial capabilities are one of our most
important differentiators. We expect our extensive experience with gynecologists and healthcare providers, along with the historical
adoption of our OvaSuite tests, to drive growth as we introduce new products. 

During
2023, we conducted a comprehensive review of our commercial programs to identify people, processes, and technology enhancements and to
refine our product messaging for greater impact and reach. As a result of the findings of that review, we implemented a revised commercial
strategy (the Commercial Refresh in the second half of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, we completed the successful
implementation of the Commercial Refresh and expect to leverage these enhancements as we continue to focus on growth through the improved
profitability, efficiency, and effectiveness of the sales and marketing teams. 

The
average number of field sales representatives during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17, compared with 20 representatives
in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average OvaSuite volume per field sales representative increased from 917 tests per
representative in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,109 tests per representative in the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
nearly a 21 increase. 

Innovation .
We believe our ability to successfully develop novel AI-powered assays is superior to others based on our knowledge and extensive experience
in designing and successfully launching FDA-cleared and laboratory developed blood tests to aid in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. We
own and operate Aspira Labs, Inc., a research and commercial CLIA laboratory in Texas, and have accumulated more than 110,000 patient
samples in our research biobank. Moreover, our history of successfully collaborating with world-class research and academic institutions
allows us to innovate and provide outstanding patient care. 

Our
product pipeline is focused on two areas: ovarian cancer and endometriosis. 

In
ovarian cancer, we have developed clinical data to support the repeated use of our OvaWatch test for the monitoring of an adnexal
mass. In the second quarter of 2024, we expanded the features of our commercially available OvaWatch test for monitoring of adnexal
masses through periodic testing at physician prescribed intervals, marking the successful completion of the vision for OvaSuite. The
successful expansion of the OvaWatch mass monitoring feature in the second quarter of 2024 resulted in a tenfold increase in the
market for our tests when compared to the addressable market for Ova1Plus of approximately 200,000 to 400,000 based on patients
identified for surgery. As a result, we believe the addressable market for our tests to have increased to between 2 and 4 million
tests per year. 

Our
OVAinform development program continues to progress. OVAinform is a multi-marker test that combines serum proteins, clinical data (metadata),
and miRNA for assessing the risk of ovarian cancer in women with an adnexal mass. 

In
endometriosis, we are developing and intend to introduce a new non-invasive test to aid in the diagnosis of this debilitating disease
that impacts millions of women worldwide. We completed the design of a protein-based non-invasive blood test to aid the detection
of endometrioma, one of the most common forms of endometriosis. The algorithm was confirmed with three independent cohorts and is an
important input for our ENDOinform program focused on developing a multi-marker test that combines serum proteins, clinical data (metadata)
and miRNA for the identification of endometriosis. 

22 

Our
endometriosis portfolio addresses an even larger addressable market. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, endometriosis
affects more than 6.5 million women in the United States. We believe the proliferation of commercially available and in-development therapeutics
for the treatment of endometriosis will create a significant demand for a non-invasive diagnostic. 

Operational
Excellence . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we decreased our operating expenses by 1.9 million, when compared with
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We have continued our history of opportunistically raising capital. We raised gross proceeds
of 5.6 million in January 2024 in a follow-on offering. We also raised gross proceeds of approximately 1.9 million in a private placement
and gross proceeds of approximately 2.1 million in a warrant inducement transaction in July 2024. Subsequent to the quarter end, we
began selling shares in connection with an At-the-Market agreement, resulting in gross proceeds of 350,000 through November 18, 2024. 

In
the second quarter of 2024, we completed a comprehensive analysis of our biobank and identified up to 70,000 serum, plasma, and whole
blood samples that are available for secondary research. In July, two material transfer agreements were executed with third parties for
an average selling price of approximately 500 per sample. We believe these purchases, while small, were an important step towards our
goal to identify opportunities for non-dilutive cash through sample dispositions, and to establish a baseline market value for the purchased
material. 

Our
Business and Products 

We
currently commercialize the following blood test products and related services: 

(1)
the Ova1Plus workflow, which uses Ova1 as the primary test and Overa as a reflex for Ova1 intermediate range results. Ova1 is a qualitative
serum test intended as an aid to further assess the likelihood of malignancy in women with an ovarian adnexal mass for which surgery
is planned when the physician s independent clinical and radiological evaluation does not indicate malignancy. Overa is a second-generation
biomarker test intended to maintain Ova1 s high sensitivity while improving specificity. The Ova1Plus workflow leverages the strengths
of Ova1 s MIA sensitivity and Overa s (MIA2G) specificity to increase performance; and 

(2)
OvaWatch, which is intended to assist in the initial and periodic clinical assessment of malignancy risk in all women thought to have
an indeterminate or benign adnexal mass. 

Our
products are distributed through our own national sales force, including field sales, inside sales and a contracted sales team, through
our proprietary decentralized testing platform and cloud service, marketed as Aspira Synergy, and through marketing and distribution
agreements with BioReference Health, LLC BioReference and ARUP Laboratories. In November of 2024, we expanded our distribution
agreement with BioReference to include OvaWatch. This timing aligns with our approval from New York State and increases our ability to market
the test in New York. This important addition will allow providers who currently order Ova1 through BioReference to also order Aspira s
products for any woman with a mass within their existing BioReference workflows. 

Our
Ova1 test received FDA de novo classification in September 2009. Ova1 comprises instruments, assays, reagents, and the OvaCalc
software, which includes a proprietary algorithm that produces a risk score. Our Overa test, which includes an updated version of OvaCalc,
received FDA 510(k) clearance in March 2016. Ova1, Overa and OvaWatch each use the Roche Cobas 4000, 6000 and 8000 platforms for analysis
of proteins. Revenue from these sources is included in the results of operations in total revenue for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024. 

In
2021, we began entering into decentralized arrangements with large healthcare networks and physician practices for our Aspira Synergy
platform, our decentralized testing platform and cloud service for decentralized global access of protein biomarker testing. Ova1, Overa,
and the Ova1Plus workflow continue to be available through the Aspira Synergy platform. As of September 30, 2024, we had one active Aspira
Synergy contract. 

OvaWatch
has been developed and is validated for use in Aspira s CLIA-certified lab as a non-invasive blood-based risk assessment test for
use in conjunction with clinical assessment and imaging to determine ovarian cancer risk for patients with an adnexal mass whose adnexal
mass has been determined by an initial clinical assessment as indeterminate or benign. OvaWatch is the only commercially available blood
test available for assessment of the risk of ovarian cancer in women diagnosed with an adnexal mass considered indeterminate or benign
by a physician s preliminary clinical assessment. 

We
collected clinical data to support the utility of OvaWatch to aid in surgical referral and as a longitudinal monitoring test, resulting
in two manuscripts that were published in peer review journals in May 2024. In addition, an abstract highlighting data evaluating the
use of OvaWatch to assess ovarian cancer risk in pre- and post-menopausal women was accepted for a poster presentation at the upcoming
Annual Meeting of The Menopause Society in September 2024. 

23 

Outside
of the United States, we sponsored studies in the Philippines aimed at validating Overa and Ova1 in specific populations. In
February 2024, we signed an exclusive license agreement with Hi-Precision Laboratories to offer OvaSuite tests in the Philippines.
In November 2024, Hi-Precision Laboratories communicated the completion of all laboratory and regulatory processes required for it
to offer Ova1Plus commercially to patients in the Philippines under the terms of our licensing agreement. Accordingly, it began
marketing the test to physicians through its existing sales and marketing channels at that time. We intend to assist
Hi-Precision in the design and execution of its commercialization and physician adoption strategy. Building on the successful launch
of Ova1Plus in the Philippines, we have created a process roadmap for future global expansion efforts. 

We
own and operate Aspira Labs, based in Austin, Texas, a Clinical Chemistry and Endocrinology Laboratory accredited by the College of American
Pathologists, which specializes in applying biomarker-based technologies to address critical needs in the management of gynecologic cancers
and disease. Aspira Labs provides expert diagnostic services using a state-of-the-art biomarker-based risk assessment to aid in clinical
decision making and to advance personalized treatment plans. The lab currently performs our Ova1Plus workflow and OvaWatch testing, and
we plan to expand the testing to other gynecologic conditions with high unmet need. Aspira s Labs holds a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation
and a state laboratory license in California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The Centers for Medicare Medicaid
Services CMS issued a supplier number to Aspira Labs in 2015. Aspira Labs also holds a current ISO 13485 certification
which is the most accepted standard worldwide for medical devices. 

In
the United States, revenue for diagnostic tests comes from several sources, including third-party payers such as insurance companies,
government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, client bill accounts and patients. Novitas Solutions, a Medicare Administrative
Carrier, covers and reimburses for Ova1 tests performed in certain states, including Texas. Due to our billed Ova1 tests being performed
exclusively at Aspira Labs in Texas, the Local Coverage Determination LCD from Novitas Solutions essentially provides
national coverage for patients enrolled in Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage health plans. We have applied for an LCD for OvaWatch,
which is currently under review. 

In
November 2016, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG issued Practice Bulletin Number 174 which
included Ova1, defined as the Multivariate Index Assay, outlining ACOG s clinical management guidelines for adnexal
mass management. Practice Bulletin Number 174 recommends that obstetricians and gynecologists evaluating women with adnexal masses who
do not meet Level A criteria of a low-risk transvaginal ultrasound should proceed with Level B clinical guidelines. Level B guidelines
state that the physician may use risk-assessment tools such as existing CA-125 technology or Ova1 Multivariate Index Assay as listed in the bulletin. Based on this, Ova1 achieved parity with CA-125 as a Level B clinical recommendation for the management of
adnexal masses. 

Practice
Bulletins summarize current information on techniques and clinical management issues for the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Practice
Bulletins are evidence-based documents, and recommendations are based on the evidence. This is also the only clinical management tool
used for adnexal masses. Although there are Practice Bulletins, guidelines do not exist for adnexal masses. ACOG guidelines do exist,
however, for ovarian cancer management. 

Product
Pipeline 

We
aim to introduce new gynecologic diagnostic products and to expand our product offerings to additional women s gynecologic health
diseases by adding additional gynecologic bio-analytic solutions involving biomarkers, clinical risk factors and patient data to aid
diagnosis and risk stratification. Future product expansions will be accelerated by the development of lab developed testing in a CLIA
environment, relationships with strategic research and development partners, and access to specimens in our biobank. 

OVAinform
 is a multi-marker test that combines serum proteins, clinical data (metadata), and miRNA for
 assessing the risk of ovarian cancer in women with an adnexal mass. The test is being developed
 in collaboration with Harvard s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (providing clinical and
 trial design expertise), Brigham Women s Hospital (providing miRNA technical
 expertise), and Medical University of Lodz (providing miRNA biomarker and bioinformatics
 analytic support). 

The
miRNAs used in the OVAinform test were the subject of a 2017 paper, Diagnostic potential for a serum miRNA neural network for
detection of ovarian cancer published in the peer-reviewed journal Cancer Biology. In October 2023, a poster entitled Improving
the diagnostic accuracy of an ovarian cancer triage test using a joint miRNA-protein model , was presented at the AACR Special
Conference in Cancer Research: Ovarian Cancer by senior author, Dr. Kevin Elias M.D., Director, Gynecologic Oncology Laboratory at Brigham
and Women s Hospital and Assistant Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology at Harvard Medical School. The
poster highlighted data from a study that combined serum protein and patient clinical information (metadata) from Aspira s ovarian
cancer registry studies with miRNA determined by the Elias laboratory. The data showed using miRNA in combination with serum proteins,
provided superior performance over existing ovarian cancer risk assessment blood tests. 

We
have tested our entire set of selected miRNA biomarkers and, based on their performance, we are refining the features on our droplet
digital PCR commercial platform. As a next step, we intend to increase our patient sample testing to refine the algorithm. 

24 

EndoCheck
 is the first protein biomarker test designed to identify ovarian endometriomas, one of
 the most common forms of endometriosis. We have confirmed the algorithm with three independent
 cohorts, achieving preliminary performance that supports its use to aid the detection and
 treatment of endometrioma. Endocheck research is an important input for our ENDOinform program
 focused on developing a multi-marker test that combines serum proteins, clinical data (metadata)
 and miRNA for the identification of endometriosis. Endocheck will not be launched as an independent
 test, and our future efforts will be focused on the development of ENDOinform. 

ENDOinform
 (formerly EndoMDx) is a multi-marker test program that combines serum proteins, clinical
 data (metadata), and miRNA for the identification of endometriosis. The test is being developed
 in collaboration with a consortium of academic and clinical partners led by Dana Farber Cancer
 Institute. We are currently in the process of analyzing the first 100 patient samples to
 verify protein and miRNA biomarkers for their analytical properties on our droplet digital
 PCR commercial platform. This is a critical step in evaluating the strength of algorithms
 that incorporate miRNAs. 

Recent
Developments 

Business
Updates 

On
May 7, 2024, we announced the publication of two peer-reviewed manuscripts. The first manuscript, entitled Ovarian Cancer Surgical
Consideration is Markedly Improved by the Neural Network Powered-MIA3G Multivariate Index Assay was published in the peer-reviewed
journal Frontiers of Medicine on May 2, 2024. The findings of this study demonstrate that use of OvaWatch to stratify risk in patients
with an adnexal mass might help to reduce surgical backlogs and unnecessary surgical referrals. The second manuscript, entitled Neural
Network-derived Multivariate Index Assay Demonstrates Effective Clinical Performance in Longitudinal Monitoring of Ovarian Cancer Risk 
was published in the journal Gynecologic Oncology on May 3, 2024. The findings of this study demonstrate that OvaWatch could be an effective
tool for the monitoring of ovarian cancer risk over time in women with indeterminate or low risk adnexal masses. Based on common practice
for adnexal mass management and consistent with the study, OvaWatch can be drawn by the provider every three to six months for active
surveillance of an adnexal mass. 

A
publication entitled Serum miRNA improves the accuracy of a multivariate index assay for triage of an adnexal mass was published
in the journal Gynecologic Oncology, August of 2024 from the laboratory of our collaborator Dr. Kevin Elias at the Brigham and
Women s Hospital. The paper describes the novel combination of microRNAs (miRNAs) and serum proteins to achieve increased
performance in the assessment of malignancy risk in patients with an adnexal mass. The miRNAs, discovered by Dr Elias team,
in combination with serum proteins from Aspira Women s Health s proprietary multivariate index assays Ova1 and Overa showed
increased sensitivity for detection of malignancy and broader detection of diverse ovarian cancer subtypes. This publication establishes
the feasibility of improved tests using multi-omic information. Webber JW, Wollborn L, Mishra S, Vitonis AF, Cramer DW, Phan
RT, Pappas TC, Stawiski K, Fendler W, Chowdhury D, Elias KM. Serum miRNA improves the accuracy of a multivariate index assay for triage
of an adnexal mass. Gynecol Oncol. 2024 Aug 23;190:124-130 .) 

An
abstract entitled Application of a Deep Neural Network-Based Algorithm to Provide Additional Information in the Assessment
of Adnexal Masses Classified as Indeterminate by Imaging was presented as a poster at the Annual Meeting of The Menopause
Society in September 2024. This presentation highlighted data evaluating the use of OvaWatch to assess ovarian cancer risk in pre- and
post-menopausal women. The data demonstrated that in women with an adnexal mass and an indeterminate ultrasound imaging result, the OvaWatch
result indicated low malignant potential of the mass in more than 70 of patients. The use of OvaWatch could provide additional information
to reduce surgical referrals. 

An
EndoCheck-related abstract entitled Association of the Endometriosis Health Profile-5 (EHP-5) with Non-Invasive Biomarkers
in Patients with Suspected Endometriosis was presented as a poster at the 27 th Annual National Association of Nurse
Practitioner s in Women s Health (NPWH) Women s Healthcare Conference in September 2024. This poster examined the association
of biomarkers for ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma) with quality-of-life survey responses before and after surgical intervention.
There was no association between endometrioma biomarkers and self-reported patient quality of life either prior to or after surgery,
and this was consistent with other research. 

An
EndoCheck-related virtual poster entitled A Proprietary Protein-Based Algorithm May Increase Sensitivity of Endometrioma Detection
When Combined with Imaging will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists
in November 2024. This poster summarizes a preliminary study on the performance of imaging combined with a protein biomarker-based algorithm.
The combination of these diagnostic tools resulted in increased sensitivity of detection of endometrioma and could be effective in risk
assessment and surgical planning for this condition. 

On
July 1, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market notifying us that, for the 30 consecutive business days
prior to the date of the deficiency letter, our Market Value of Listed Securities was below the minimum of 35 million market cap
requirement for continued inclusion on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) (the MVLS
Requirement ). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), Nasdaq has provided us with 180 calendar days, or until
December 30, 2024, to regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement. In the event we do not regain compliance prior to December 30, 2024, we
will receive written notification that our securities are subject to delisting, at which point we may appeal the delisting determination. 

On
October 15, 2024, the Company announced that it had received approval from the New York State Department of Health s Clinical Laboratory
Evaluation Program for OvaWatch. This approval is required for all lab developed tests to ensure compliance with New York State s
clinical laboratory regulatory standards. The comprehensive review process includes an assessment of procedures for maintaining quality,
traceability, and risk management. 

25 

On
October 17, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that, the bid price for our common stock (the
 Common Stock for the 30 consecutive business days, had closed below the minimum 1.00 per share and, as a result, we are
not in compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement for the continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), Nasdaq has provided us with 180 calendar days,
or until April 15, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of
the Common Stock must meet or exceed 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this 180-day period. If we
are not in compliance by April 15, 2025, we may qualify for a second 180 calendar day compliance period. If we do not qualify for, fail
to regain compliance during the second compliance period, or if we appear to Nasdaq to be unable to cure the deficiency, then Nasdaq
will notify us of its determination to delist our Common Stock, at which point we would have an option to appeal the delisting determination
to a Nasdaq hearings panel. 

On
October 23, 2024, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden announced that we had been selected by the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health ARPA-H as an awardee of the Sprint for Women s Health, an initiative to address critical unmet challenges in women s health, champion
transformative innovations, and tackle health conditions that uniquely or disproportionately affect women. Under this initiative, we
will receive up to 10 million in milestone-based funding over two years to develop our multi-marker blood test to aid in the detection
of endometriosis. Our test will rely on a powerful, AI-powered algorithm that combines protein and microRNA biomarkers and patient data,
and leverage technology that we pioneered for our ovarian cancer risk assessment blood tests. 

We
expect to meet the first milestone for payment in the fourth quarter of 2024. Upon successful acceptance of the required information
related to the first milestone, we will receive a payment of 2 million. The award also provides for access to a team of world-class
subject matter experts and advisors to support the successful completion and commercial launch of the test before the end of the two-year
contract term. We will work with an ARPA-H Program Manager and the ARPA-H Investor Catalyst Hub in the design, development, and commercial
launch of this first-of-its kind endometriosis diagnostic test. 

On
October 29, 2024, we held a virtual Investor Day presentation to discuss our successful presentation to ARPA-H and provide more details
about the project. 

Market
Access and Reimbursement 

We
continue to gain momentum in our activities to increase coverage and reimbursement of OvaSuite products by contracting with payers and
gaining OvaWatch reimbursement. The volume of Northeast Anthem claims, contracted in August 2024, is increasing and expected to improve
the reimbursement per test in upcoming quarters. We further expect additional Anthem regions to complete contracting in the Anthem Central
and Virginia geographic regions in the fourth quarter, adding an additional 16 million lives. 

In
the third quarter we completed a comprehensive analysis of select national, regional and Integrated Delivery Network (IDN) payers
with the assistance of an experienced third-party consultant. The project provided additional insights regarding evidence
requirements for broad support and reimbursement of OvaWatch. The findings of the analysis are being incorporated into a clinical
utility study which is currently under development, the timing of which will depend on working capital available for its
completion. While this project was focused on OvaWatch, we believe the output will help us advocate for expanded coverage for Ova1 and inform future
market access strategies for future product launches. 

Additionally, we met with numerous Medical Directors from Laboratory Benefit
Management organizations and regional payers and have a further understanding of their requirements for OvaSuite medical
necessity. 

We
also initiated an audit of our commercial payer contracts to ensure appropriate reimbursement. With this we have engaged in discussions
that could improve the average unit price for OvaSuite tests. Additionally, we continue to monitor the state biomarker laws, which are
increasingly mandating insurance coverage for biomarker testing in oncology . This trend is driven by the growing recognition of
the importance of precision medicine and the need to ensure that patients have access to the most appropriate treatments. While these
laws are a significant step forward, challenges remain, including inconsistencies across states, difficulties in defining medically
necessary, and the requirement to demonstrate clinical utility utilizing real world evidence as a benchmark. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

There
have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on
April 1, 2024. 

Our
product revenue is generated by performing diagnostic services using our OvaSuite tests, and the service is completed upon the delivery
of the test result to the prescribing physician. The entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation contained
in a contract with a patient. Under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , all revenue is recognized upon completion
of the OvaSuite test and delivery of test results to the physician based on estimates of amounts that will ultimately be realized. In
determining the amount of revenue to be recognized for a delivered test result, we consider factors such as payment history and amount,
payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, and any developments or changes that could impact
reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management. For OvaSuite tests, we also review our patient account population
and determine an appropriate distribution of patient accounts by payer i.e. , Medicare, patient pay, other third-party payer,
 etc .) into portfolios with similar collection experience. When evaluated for collectability, this results in a materially consistent
revenue amount for such portfolios as if each patient account were evaluated on an individual contract basis.

Product
Revenue . Product revenue was 2,257,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,217,000 for the same period
in 2023. Revenue for Aspira Labs is recognized when the test result is successfully delivered based on estimates of what we expect to
ultimately realize. The 2 product revenue increase is due to an increase in OvaSuite test volume. The OvaWatch AUP increased as reimbursement
continues to conform with that of Ova1 as a result of additional contracts and higher collections. 

The
number of OvaSuite tests performed increased 4 to 6,001 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5,783 product
tests for the same period in 2023. This increase is a result of our revised commercial strategy. We expect test volume to increase in
the fourth quarter of 2024 as a result of our investment in key sales and marketing personnel and the launch of OvaWatch longitudinal
testing. 

The
volume and AUP for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows.

Cost
of Revenue Product. Cost of product revenue was 902,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 910,000
for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of 8,000, or 1 , due primarily to increased shipping costs, offset by decreased
lab supplies and personnel costs. 

Gross
Profit Margin. Gross profit margin for product revenue increased to 60.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 59.0 for the same period in 2023. The change was due to the increase in product revenue and the decrease in cost of product revenue. 

Research
and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology and carry out
clinical studies, and include personnel-related expenses, regulatory costs, reagents and supplies used in research and development laboratory
work, infrastructure expenses, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 decreased by 90,000, or 9 , compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in
personnel costs of 164,000, partially offset by an increase in consulting costs of 56,000. We expect research and development expenses
to increase over the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of our focus on the product pipeline for ARPA-H. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, education and promotional
expenses. These expenses include the costs of educating physicians and other healthcare professionals regarding our products. Sales and
marketing expenses also include the costs of sponsoring continuing medical education, medical meeting participation, and dissemination
of scientific and health economic publications. Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased
by 441,000, or 26 , compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs of 340,000 and
costs related to our contracted sales team of 123,000 and travel expenses of 121,000, offset by a decrease in other marketing costs
of 82,000. We expect sales and marketing expenses to modestly increase over the fourth quarter of 2024 as we continue to focus on the
commercialization of OvaWatch. 

General
and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, professional
fees and other costs, including legal, finance and accounting expenses and other infrastructure expenses. General and administrative
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 675,000, or 25 , compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease
was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs of 407,000 and legal expenses of 232,000. We expect general and administrative expenses
to remain flat for the fourth quarter of 2024. 

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was a net decrease in fair value
of warrant liabilities of 174,000. The decrease consisted of the change in warrant value of 137,000 due to the decrease in our
stock price during the year and 37,000 due to the modification of certain warrants that were originally issued in 2022. For the three months ended September 30,
2023 there was a net increase in fair value of 1,201,000. The change in fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2023
was primarily due to an increase in the Company s stock price during the quarter.

Product
Revenue . Product revenue was 6,833,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7,023,000 for the same period
in 2023. The 3 product revenue decrease is due to a decrease in the AUP per test, as well as the OvaSuite test volume compared to the
prior year. The AUP for Ova1 tests decreased primarily as a result of our quarterly adjustments to estimates of variable consideration
in 2023. 

The
number of OvaSuite tests performed decreased to 18,301 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18,331 product tests
for the same period in 2023.

Cost
of Revenue Product. Cost of product revenue was 2,843,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,981,000
for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of 138,000, or 5 , due primarily to decreased consulting costs. 

Gross
Profit Margin. Gross profit margin for product revenue increased to 58.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 57.5 for the same period in 2023. The change was due to the decrease in cost of product revenue, offset by the decrease in product
revenue. 

Research
and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 180,000,
or 6 , compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs of 666,000, offset by increased
consulting costs of 204,000 and lab supplies of 94,000, as well as a one-time credit in 2023 of 200,000. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 100,000, or 2 ,
compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with our contracted sales team
of 684,000 and personnel costs of 559,000, offset by decreased consulting costs (including stock compensation) of 780,000, subscription
costs of 187,000 and other marketing costs of 171,000. 

General
and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1,831,000,
or 19 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs of 755,000, consulting
costs (including stock compensation) of 649,000 and public company expenses of 137,000. 

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a net decrease in fair value of
warrant liabilities of 1,314,000. The decrease consisted of the change in warrant value due to the decrease in our stock price during
the year of 1,768,000, offset by an increase 454,000 due to two modifications of certain warrants that were originally issued in 2022.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 there was a net decrease in fair value of 233,000 related to the decrease in our stock
price. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
plan to continue to expend resources selling and marketing OvaSuite and developing additional diagnostic tests and service capabilities. 

We
have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, and as a result have an accumulated deficit
of approximately 530,009,000 as of September 30, 2024. We also expect to incur a net loss and negative cash flows from operations for
the remainder of 2024. Working capital levels may not be sufficient to fund operations as currently planned through the next twelve months,
absent a significant increase in revenue over historic revenue or additional financing. Given the above conditions, there is substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these consolidated interim financial statements
are filed. 

We
expect to raise capital through sources that may include public or private equity offerings, debt financings, the exercise of common
stock warrants, collaborations, licensing arrangements, grants and government funding and strategic alliances, as well as our existing
at-the-market and equity line of credit facilities. However, additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable
to us. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may not be able to continue sales and marketing, research and development, or
other operations on the scope or scale of current activity, and that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. 

In
March 2016, we entered into a loan agreement (as amended on March 7, 2018, and April 3, 2020, the DECD Loan Agreement with
the State of Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development (the DECD ), pursuant to which we may borrow up
to 4,000,000 from the DECD. 

30 

The
loan may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. An initial disbursement of 2,000,000 was made to us on April 15, 2016, under
the DECD Loan Agreement. On December 3, 2020, we received a disbursement of the remaining 2,000,000 under the DECD Loan Agreement, as
we had achieved the target employment milestone necessary to receive an additional 1,000,000 under the DECD Loan Agreement and the DECD
determined to fund the remaining 1,000,000 under the DECD Loan Agreement after concluding that the required revenue target would likely
have been achieved in the first quarter of 2020 in the absence of the impacts of COVID-19. 

Under
the terms of the DECD Loan Agreement, we would be eligible for forgiveness of up to 1,500,000 of the principal amount of the loan if
we had achieved certain job creation and retention milestones by December 31, 2022. On June 26, 2023, we were notified by the DECD that
we had satisfied all job creation and retention requirements under the loan agreement to receive forgiveness of 1,000,000. If we fail
to maintain our Connecticut operations through March 22, 2026, the DECD may require early repayment of a portion or all of the loan plus
a penalty of 5 of the total funded loan. For additional information, see Note 4 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In
connection with a private placement offering of common stock and warrants we completed in May 2013, we entered into a stockholders agreement
which, among other things, granted two of the primary investors in that offering the right to participate in any future equity offerings
by the Company on the same price and terms as other investors. In addition, the stockholders agreement prohibits us from taking certain
material actions without the consent of at least one of the two primary investors in that offering. These material actions include: 

Making
 any acquisition with a value greater than 2 million; 

Offering,
 selling or issuing any securities senior to Aspira s common stock or any securities
 that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for securities ranking senior to
 Aspira s common stock; 

Taking
 any action that would result in a change in control of the Company or an insolvency event;
 and 

Paying
 or declaring dividends on any securities of the Company or distributing any assets of the
 Company other than in the ordinary course of business or repurchasing any outstanding securities
 of the Company. 

The
foregoing rights terminate for a primary investor when that investor ceases to beneficially own less than 50 of the shares and warrants
(taking into account shares issued upon exercise of the warrants), in the aggregate, that were purchased at the closing of the 2013 private
placement. We believe that the rights of one of the primary investors have so terminated. 

On
February 10, 2023, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the 2023 At-the-Market Offering Agreement with Cantor, as agent, pursuant to which we may
offer and sell, from time to time, through Cantor, shares of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share, having an aggregate
offering price of up to 12.5 million. The 2023 At-the-Market Offering Agreement was terminated in August 2024. 

On
March 28, 2023, we entered into an agreement with Lincoln Park (the 2023 Equity Line of Credit Agreement ), pursuant to which we have
the right to sell to Lincoln Park shares of our common stock (the Purchase Shares ), having an aggregate value of up to
 10 million, subject to certain limitations and conditions, at our sole discretion during a 36-month period ending March 27, 2026. 

The
issuance of the Purchase Shares had been previously registered pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File
No. 333-252267) (the Old Registration Statement ), and the related base prospectus included in the Registration Statement,
as supplemented by a prospectus supplement filed on March 28, 2023, that has expired. On April 22, 2024, we filed a registration statement
on Form S-3 (File No. 333-278867) (the Registration Statement ), and the related base prospectus included in the Registration
Statement, that has been declared effective by the SEC on April 25, 2024. 

We
sold 472,312 shares of Common Stock under the 2023 Equity Line of Credit Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately 1,578,000 under the Old Registration
Statement. In addition, 47,733 shares of Common Stock were issued to Lincoln Park as consideration for entering into the 2023 Equity Line of Credit
Agreement. 

On
April 26, 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement to the Registration Statement related to the sale of up to 3,200,000 shares of Common
Stock pursuant to the 2023 Equity Line of Credit Agreement. 

On
July 24, 2023, we completed a direct offering (the Direct Offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately 4,157,000,
after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of 597,000. 

31 

Under
the terms of the July 24, 2023 follow-on equity offering, we agreed not to sell shares under the 2023 Equity Line of Credit Agreement for 90 days.
On October 30, 2023, we resumed selling shares under the 2023 Equity Line of Credit Agreement. As of August 9, 2024, the Company has sold 362,219 shares
for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 400,000 subsequent to June 30, 2024. 

On
January 24, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the 2024 Direct Offering Agreement ), with several investors
relating to the issuance and sale of 1,371,000 shares of its common stock, par value 0.001 per share, and pre-funded warrants to purchase
200,000 shares of Common Stock (the Pre-Funded Warrants ), in a registered direct offering, together with accompanying warrants
to purchase 1,571,000 shares of Common Stock (the Purchase Warrants , and together with the Pre-Funded Warrants, the Warrants in a concurrent private placement (the Concurrent Private Offering and together with the registered direct offering, the
 2024 Direct Offering ). Our gross proceeds from the 2024 Direct Offering were approximately 5.6 million, before deducting
placement agent fees and other estimated expenses of 733,000 payable by us. 

The
Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised on February 6, 2024 for 20. 

The
Purchase Warrants have an exercise price of 4.13 per share and will be exercisable beginning six months after issuance and will expire
5 years from the initial exercise date. 

Effective
upon the closing of the 2024 Direct Offering, we also amended certain existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 366,664
shares at an exercise price of 13.20 per share and a termination date of August 25, 2027, so that the amended warrants have a reduced
exercise price of 4.13 per share and a new termination date of January 26, 2029. The other terms of the amended warrants remain unchanged. 

On
July 1, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors in a private placement offering. Pursuant to the
agreement, we issued an aggregate of 1,248,529 shares of its common stock and accompanying warrants (the July 2024
Warrants to purchase an equal number of shares of common stock at a price of 1.53 per share and accompanying warrant. The
July 2024 Warrants have an exercise price of 2.25 per share and are exercisable immediately. They will expire on July 9, 2027. The
transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately 1,900,000, before deducting estimated costs of 73,000. 

On
July 31, 2024, we entered into a warrant inducement transaction with a certain investor, which resulted in gross proceeds of
approximately 2,139,000, before deducting estimated costs of 277,000, excluding 1,323,000 of incremental value on the modification of the warrants. Under the terms of the Warrant Inducement Agreement, we
agreed not to sell shares under the 2023 Equity Line of Credit Agreement from for six months from the effective date of the
agreement. 

On
August 2, 2024, we entered into an agreement with H.C. Wainwright in connection with an At the Market offering agreement (the 2024 At-the-Market Offering to sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate sales price of up to 4,450,000, from time to time, through
an at the market offering program under which H.C. Wainwright will act as sales agent. We will pay Wainwright a commission
rate equal to 3.0 of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of shares under the 2024 At-the-Market Offering. Under the terms of the Warrant Inducement Agreement,
we were prohibited from selling shares under the 2024 At-the-Market Offering for 60 days from the closing date. On October 23, 2024, we began drawing
down on the 2024 At-the-Market Offering. As of November 18, 2024, we sold 348,185 shares of Common Stock under the 2024 At-the-Market Offering for gross proceeds
of approximately 350,000. 

On
October 23, 2024, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden announced that we had been selected by ARPA-H as an awardee for the Sprint for Women s
Health launchpad track for later-stage health solutions, an initiative to address critical unmet challenges in women s health,
champion transformative innovations, and tackle health conditions that uniquely or disproportionately affect women. Under this initiative,
we will receive up to 10 million in milestone-based funding over two years to develop our multi-marker blood test to aid in the detection
of endometriosis. Our test will rely on a powerful, AI-enabled algorithm that combines protein and microRNA biomarkers and patient data,
and leverage technology that we pioneered for our ovarian cancer risk assessment blood tests. 

We
expect to meet the first milestone for payment in the fourth quarter of 2024. Upon successful acceptance of the required information
related to the first milestone, we will receive a payment of 2 million. The award also provides for access to a team of world-class
subject matter experts and advisors to support the successful completion and commercial launch of the test before the end of the two-year
contract term. We will work with an ARPA-H Program Manager and the ARPA-H Investor Catalyst Hub in the design, development, and commercial
launch of this first-of-its kind endometriosis diagnostic test. 

As
mentioned, we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, and we expect to continue
to incur a net loss and negative cash flows from operations in 2024. At September 30, 2024 we had an accumulated deficit of 530,009,000
and stockholders deficit of 2,520,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had 2,133,000 of cash and cash equivalents, 4,113,000 of
current assets and 5,466,000 of current liabilities. While we expect to grow revenue through Aspira Labs, there is no assurance of our
ability to generate substantial revenues and cash flows from Aspira Labs operations. We expect revenue from our products to be
our only material, recurring source of cash in 2024. 

32 

Our
future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including, among others: 

resources
 devoted to sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; 

the
 rate of OvaSuite product adoption by physicians and patients; 

the
 rate of product adoption by healthcare systems and large physician practices of the decentralized
 distribution agreements for OvaSuite; 

the
 insurance payer community s acceptance of and reimbursement for our products; 

our
 plans to acquire or invest in other products, technologies and businesses; and 

the
 potential need to add study sites to access additional patients to maintain clinical timelines. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 11,092,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting primarily from the net
loss reported of 11,706,000, which includes non-cash expenses in the amount of 1,290,000 related to changes in accounts payable,
stock compensation expense of 864,000, and 560,000 related to changes in prepaid expense, offset by 1,314,000 relating to a
change in the fair value of warrants, changes in other liabilities of 668,000 and changes in accrued liabilities of
 369,000. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 12,444,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting primarily from the net loss
reported of 13,601,000, which includes 1,302,000 related to stock compensation expense, non-cash expenses in the amount of 1,011,000
related to changes in prepaid expense, 258,000 related to commitment shares for the equity line and 162,000 related to depreciation
and amortization, offset by the DECD loan forgiveness of 1,000,000, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities of 233,000, changes
in accounts receivable of 345,000 and changes in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities of 474,000. 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 37,000 and 12,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, which
consisted of property and equipment purchases. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 10,407,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, stemming primarily from a registered
direct offering resulting in net proceeds of 4,830,000, after deducting placement agent costs and other expenses of 733,000, a warrant
inducement offering resulting in net proceeds of 1,862,000, after deducting issuance costs of 1,600,000, proceeds from an equity line
of credit offering of 1,901,000 and proceeds from a private equity offering resulting in proceeds of 1,838,000. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 4,255,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, stemming primarily from a registered
direct offering resulting in net proceeds of 4,157,000, after deducting placement agent costs and other expenses of 559,000, an equity
line of credit offering of 178,000 and an at the market offering resulting in net proceeds of 68,000, after deducting transaction-related
offering costs of 134,000, in addition to principal payments on the DECD loan. 

Based
on the available objective evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable.
Accordingly, we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Therefore, there was no deferred income
tax expense or benefit for the period. 

Our
pre-2018 federal NOLs will expire in varying amounts from 2023 through 2037, if not utilized, and can offset 100 of future taxable income
for regular tax purposes. Any federal NOLs arising after January 1, 2018, can generally be carried forward indefinitely but such federal
NOL carryforwards are permitted to be used in any taxable year to offset up to 80 of taxable income in such year. Portions of our state
NOLs will expire in varying amounts from 2023 through 2037 if not utilized. Our ability to use our NOLs during this period will be dependent
on our ability to generate taxable income, and the portions of our NOLs could expire before we generate sufficient taxable income. 

Our
ability to use our net operating loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income is restricted due to ownership change
limitations that have occurred in the past, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Section
382 ), as well as similar state provisions. Net operating losses which are limited from offsetting any future taxable income under
Section 382 are not included in the gross deferred tax assets. Due to the existence of a valuation allowance, it is not expected that
such limitations, if any, will have an impact on our results of operations or financial position. 

Our
unrecognized tax benefits attributable to research and development credits will increase during the period for tax positions taken during
the year and will decrease for expiration of a portion of the carryforwards during the period.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Per
Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, the information called for by this Item 3 is not required. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures 

Our
senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024,
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. This was due to two material weaknesses in the internal control over financial
reporting that were identified as of December 31, 2023, and disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report Form 10-K related to multiple deficiencies
and a lack of timely operation of certain internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure that continue to exist as of September
30, 2024. 

Material
Weaknesses 

As
previously reported, we identified material weaknesses related to: 

the
 operation of internal controls related to information technology general controls ITGCs that are used to process and record certain revenue and expense transactions and support
 our financial reporting processes. The internal control around ITGCs resulted in the lack
 of certain internal controls over these IT systems and over data and reports accumulated
 in such IT systems; and 

the
 design and implementation of our control activities over our revenue process. We did not
 adequately design controls to validate the delivery of the lab results to ordering physicians
 to ensure that revenue is being appropriately recognized. 

Remediation
Activities 

In
order to address the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described above, management is performing, with
direction from the audit committee, the following remediation activities: 

Retained
 an internal controls specialist to complement the skills of the existing accounting and financial
 reporting staff, as well as implement key controls to improve business processes, including
 revenue and the IT environment. 

Completed
 a preliminary process to identify all information technology applications that support the
 Company s financial reporting processes and assess the risk of misstatement associated
 with each. 

Completed
 a comprehensive review of the design and performance of internal controls related to information
 technology applications, including user access and program change controls. 

Enhanced
 controls that require the assessment of service organization controls prior to implementation
 and on an annual basis. 

Retained
 additional accounting and financial reporting resources during the year-end close to improve
 our ability to perform our disclosure controls and procedures on a timely basis, particularly
 for certain significant, non-routine or complex transactions. 

Providing
 additional training and continuing education to accounting staff regarding SEC requirements
 and required disclosures under GAAP. 

Enhanced
 the design of and implementation of controls around the rigor of the review process, and
 retention of sufficient appropriate evidence over the revenue process. 

34 

Management
will continue to review and make necessary changes to the overall design of our internal control environment, as well as policies and
procedures to improve the overall effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses will not be considered
remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing,
that these controls are operating effectively. 

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting 

As
steps to remediate the material weaknesses discussed above, management has reviewed the design and performance of internal controls
related to information technology applications and enhanced the design of and implementation of controls around the rigor of its review
and documentation process. Apart from these steps, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the period ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

In
the ordinary course of business, we may periodically become subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with ongoing
business activities. The results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable resolutions are possible
and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. In addition, regardless of the
outcome, litigation could have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
While the outcome of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, there are no matters, as of September 30, 2024,
that, in the opinion of management, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

There
have been no material changes to our risk factors from those disclosed under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (the 2023 Annual Report and in Part II Item 1 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 13, 2024 .
The risks and uncertainties described in our 2023 Annual Report are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not
presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings
with the SEC. 

If
we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price
of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. 

Our
Common Stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and the continued listing of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market
is contingent on our continued compliance with a number of listing requirements. If we are unable to comply with the continued listing
requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common Stock would be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which would limit investors 
ability to effect transactions in our Common Stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions. In order to maintain our listing,
we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of stockholders 
equity and a minimum number of public stockholders, as well as satisfying other listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition
to these objective standards, Nasdaq Capital Market may delist the securities of any issuer for other reasons involving the judgment
of Nasdaq Capital Market. 

On July 1, 2024, we received
a deficiency letter (the Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC Nasdaq stating that for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the Notice, our Market Value of
Listed Securities was below the minimum of 35 million required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) (the MVLS Requirement ). Nasdaq has provided us with 180 calendar days, or
until December 30, 2024 (the MVLS Compliance Date ), to regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement. 

To regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement, the market value of our common stock must meet or exceed 35.0 million
for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180-day grace period ending on the MVLS Compliance Date, unless the Staff exercises
its discretion to extend this ten consecutive business day period. In the event we do not regain compliance prior to the MVLS Compliance
Date, we will receive written notification that our securities are subject to delisting, at which point then we may appeal the delisting
determination. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital
Market. 

On
October 17, 2024, we received written notice from Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the
minimum bid price of our common stock had been below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810, we have a period of 180 calendar days, or until April 15, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum
bid price requirement and market value of common stock requirement. To regain compliance with the Nasdaq bid price requirement, the
closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed 1.00 per share for at least 10 consecutive business days during this 180-
calendar day period. In the event we do not regain compliance by April 15, 2025, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar
day grace period; however, there can be no assurance that we will regain compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing
requirements. 

There
is no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing standards and/or continue
our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market in the future. 

If
the Nasdaq Capital Market delists our Common Stock from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another
national securities exchange, we expect the Common Stock would qualify to be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur,
we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

a
 limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced
 liquidity for our securities; 

substantially
 impair our ability to raise additional funds; 

the
 loss of institutional investor interest and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in
 the future; 

a
 determination that our Common Stock is a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in our Common Stock to adhere
 to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 

a
 limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 

potential
 breaches of representations or covenants of our agreements pursuant to which we made representations or covenants relating to our
 compliance with applicable listing requirements, which, regardless of merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities
 and diversion of our management s time and attention and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business
 and results of operations.
