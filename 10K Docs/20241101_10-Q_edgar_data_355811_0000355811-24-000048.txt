 In addition to annual impairment testing, which is performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter, the Company continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets thus resulting in the need for interim impairment testing, including long-term revenue growth projections, profitability, discount rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company's market capitalization, and general industry, market and macroeconomic conditions. No such events or circumstances that might negatively impact the key assumptions were observed in the third quarter of 2024 and, as such, nothing indicated the need for interim impairment testing. 
 
 The Company also acquired In-Process Research Development ("In-Process R D") as part of the acquisitions of: Vaporsens; Air-Craftglass; Argil; and Guardian, each of which has been previously disclosed.

FINANCIAL CONDITION: 
 The Company's cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 were 179.6 million, a decrease of 46.8 million, compared to 226.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to share repurchases, capital expenditures, investment purchases, and dividend payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was partially offset by cash flows from operations. 
 Short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 were 20.5 million, up from 14.4 million as of December 31, 2023, and long-term investments were 325.6 million as of September 30, 2024, up from 299.1 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 increased approximately 34.5 million compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to the increase in sales and timing thereof during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Inventories as of September 30, 2024 were 449.3 million, compared to 402.5 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases in raw materials and finished goods. 
 
 Accounts payable as of September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 1.8 million to 182.6 million, when compared to December 31, 2023, primarily driven by timing of payments within the quarter. 
 Accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2024 increased approximately 13.3 million compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases in accrued salaries and wages. 
 Cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 23.9 million to 343.8 million, compared with 367.7 million during the same nine month period last year, primarily due to changes in working capital. 
 Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 103.0 million, compared with approximately 121.4 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to timing of payments and a decrease in expenditures related to building and facility construction projects previously disclosed as certain manufacturing facility construction was completed, as further described below. 
 The Company believes its existing and planned facilities are currently suitable, adequate, and have the capacity required for current and near-term planned business. Nevertheless, the Company continues to evaluate longer term facility needs. In 2023, the Company completed construction on a 345,000 square-foot manufacturing facility located at a 140 acre site in Zeeland, Michigan. The total cost of the building project was approximately 85 million, which was funded with cash and cash equivalents on hand. The Company began construction on two building expansions during 2022. The Company is expanding its current distribution center for an additional 300,000 square feet, with a total cost still expected to be approximately 40 - 45 million. The Company is also expanding one of its manufacturing facilities for an additional 60,000 feet, with a total cost still expected to be 20 - 30 million. Both expansion projects will be funded with cash and cash equivalents on hand. The Company also entered into a multi-year lease for 32,000 square feet of manufacturing space at a location approximately 20 miles from its main campus that began operations during the second quarter of 2023. 
 During 2023, the Company began the design and initial build phase of the previously announced Gentex Discovery Preschool, an on-site daycare and preschool designed to provide Company employees with convenient, cost-effective access to quality childcare. Construction began in the third quarter of 2024 as previously announced, with an expected completion date in 2025. The total cost of the building project is expected to be 15 - 20 million, which will also be funded with cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
 The Company estimates that it currently has building capacity to manufacture approximately 42 - 45 million interior mirror units annually and approximately 19 - 22 million exterior mirror units annually, based on current product mix. The Company also evaluates equipment capacity on an ongoing basis and adds equipment as needed. 
 Management considers the current working capital and long-term investments, in addition to internally generated cash flow, its Credit Agreement, and credit worthiness, to be sufficient to cover anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future considering its contractual obligations and commitments.

The following is a summary of working capital and long-term investments: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Working Capital 762,519,565 726,129,177 Fixed Income Long-Term Investments 140,578,453 155,863,252 Total 903,098,018 881,992,429 
 
 The Company has a previously announced share repurchase plan under which the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company's common stock, which remains a part of the broader publicly disclosed capital allocation strategy. Future share repurchases may vary from time to time and will take into account macroeconomic events, market trends, and other factors the Company deems appropriate (including, but not limited to, the market price of the stock, anti-dilutive effect of repurchases, and available cash). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 3,194,815 and 5,798,385 shares respectively. The Company has 10,052,794 shares remaining under the plan as of September 30, 2024, as is further detailed in Part II, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q. 

BUSINESS UPDATE 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024, the Company reported net sales of 608.5 million, compared to net sales of 575.8 million in the third quarter of 2023, a 6 increase quarter over quarter. For the third quarter of 2024, global light vehicle production in North America, Europe, and Japan/Korea decreased approximately 6 , when compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Company had 25 net new launches of interior and exterior auto-dimming mirrors and electronic features. 
 
 PRODUCT UPDATE 
 
 Mirror Systems 
 
 In 2023, The People's Republic of China newly issued GB15084 and the related procedures, which allow for the Company's frameless inside mirrors to be used on vehicles in the China domestic market. 
 
 Camera Systems 
 
 Full Display Mirror began production in 2015. Current automotive design trends are yielding vehicles with small rear windows that are often further obstructed by headrests, passengers, and roof support pillars which can significantly hinder the mirror s rearward view. The Company's Full Display Mirror is an intelligent rear vision system that uses a custom, internally or externally mounted video camera and mirror-integrated video display to optimize a vehicle driver s rearward view. This rear vision system consists of a hybrid Full Display Mirror that offers bi-modal functionality. In mirror mode, the product functions as an auto-dimming rearview mirror which means that during nighttime driving, digital light sensors talk to one another via a microprocessor to automatically darken the mirror when glare is detected. With the flip of a switch, the mirror enters display mode, and a clear, bright display appears through the mirror s reflective surface, providing a wide, unobstructed rearward view. The bi-modality of the Full Display Mirror is essential, because in the event of any failure of the camera or display, the product is able to function as a mirror, which meets long-standing safety requirements in the automotive industry. In addition, the driver has the ability to switch between modes to accommodate usage preferences for various weather conditions, lighting conditions, and driving tasks. 
 
 As of the third quarter of 2024, the Company is shipping production Full Display Mirrors to nineteen different automaker customers and 124 vehicle nameplates. For more information regarding the full display mirror please go to https://www.fulldisplaymirror.com/. The Company remains confident that ongoing discussions with other customers may cause such customers to consider more fully adding the Full Display Mirror into their product road-map for future vehicles. 
 
 To enhance capability and usability of the Company's Full Display Mirror , the Company previously introduced its three-camera rear vision system that streams rear video in multiple composite views to its Full 
 28 

Display Mirror . The Company believes it is the industry s first practical and comprehensive rear vision solution designed to meet automaker, driver, safety, and regulatory requirements. The Company's rear vision system, known generally as a camera monitoring system ("CMS"), uses three cameras to provide a comprehensive view of the sides and rear of the vehicle. The side-view cameras are discretely housed in downsized, automatic-dimming exterior mirrors. Their video feeds are combined with that of a roof-mounted or rear window based camera and stitched together into multiple composite views, which are streamed to the driver using the Full Display Mirror . The system s modular nature lets the automaker customize functionality while offering it as an affordable, optional feature thereby enhancing safety by allowing the system to fail safe. During any failures due to weather conditions or otherwise that disrupt the digital view, drivers can still safely use the interior and exterior mirrors. The system also supports user preference by permitting drivers to use standard mirror views, camera views, or both. The system can also be tuned to meet the various regulatory field-of-view requirements around the world by using different types of flat and curved glass, combined with simple alterations to the video viewing modes. Downsized exterior mirrors provide automakers with significant weight savings and fuel efficiency improvements. To further enhance safety, the Company's CMS solution can also work in conjunction with a vehicle s side blind zone warning system. When a trailing vehicle enters a side blind zone, a warning indicator illuminates in both the interior and exterior mirrors, while the corresponding side-view video feed appears in the display until the vehicle passes. 
 In July 2016, a revision to UN-ECE Regulation 46 was published with an effective date of June 18, 2016, which allows for camera monitoring systems to replace mirrors in Japan and European countries. Since January 2017, camera monitoring systems are also permitted as an alternative to replace mirrors in the Korea market. As noted, China released an updated version of its GB15084, effective in 2023, which allows for camera monitoring systems, frameless mirrors and aspheric (free-form) glass surfaces. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company continues to believe rearview mirrors provide a robust, simple and cost effective means to view the surrounding areas of a vehicle and remain a primary safety function for rear vision today. Cameras when used as the primary rear vision delivery mechanism have some inherent limitations, such as: electrical failure; cameras being blocked or obstructed; depth perception challenges; and viewing angles of the camera. Nonetheless, the Company continues designing and manufacturing not only rearview mirrors, but CMOS imagers and video displays as well. The Company believes that combining video displays with mirrors may well provide a more robust product by addressing all driving conditions in a single solution that can be controlled by the driver. As noted, the Company has been in production with the Company's Full Display Mirror since 2015 and has, in the ordinary course of business, been awarded programs with nineteen OEM customers. The Company is currently shipping production Full Display Mirrors to all nineteen of these automaker customers on over 124 nameplates globally. The Company's CMS solution uses three cameras to provide a comprehensive view of the sides and rear of the vehicle while still providing the traditional safety of interior and exterior mirrors, which mirrors continue to function when cameras are obstructed or are not functioning. The Company has also previously announced that it continues development in the areas of imager performance, camera dynamic range, lens design, image processing from the camera to the display, and camera lens cleaning. The Company acknowledges that as such technology evolves over time, such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving, there is increased competition. 
 The Company began shipping Full Display Mirror with Digital Video Recording ("DVR") capability in 2020. This mirror and system launched in the Japan market and combine the superior functionality of the Full Display Mirror , with the added capability to record video from the rearward facing and forward-facing cameras simultaneously. The data is stored to an SD storage card as requested by the customer. This integrated solution provides consumers with the features they want, while allowing the OEM to control the integration and execution in the vehicle. 
 The Company's HomeLink products are the auto industry's most widely used and trusted car-to-home communication system, with an estimated 50 million units on the road. The system consists of two or three in-vehicle buttons that can be programmed to operate garage doors, security gates, home lighting, and other radio-frequency-controlled devices. In 2017, the Company demonstrated the next generation of HomeLink , commonly referred to as HomeLink Connect , which uses both RF and wireless cloud-based connectivity to deliver complete vehicle-to-home automation. With HomeLink Connect , a HomeLink button press communicates with the HomeLink Connect app on the user s smartphone. The app contains predefined, user-programmed actions, from single device operations to entire home automation scenes. The app, in turn, communicates to the home s smart hub over the cloud activating the appropriate devices, 
 29 

including security systems, door locks, thermostats, lighting, and other home automation devices, providing comprehensive vehicle-to-home automation. The ability to prepare the home for arrival or departure can occur with one button press. For automakers, this functionality allows them to offer a customizable, yet proven solution without the engineering effort or security concerns associated with integrating third party software into the vehicle s computer network. The Company also continues work on providing HomeLink applications for alternative automobile and vehicle types which include, but are not limited to, motorcycles, mopeds, snowmobiles, tractors, combines, lawn mowers, loaders, bulldozers, road-graders, backhoes, and golf carts. In 2021, the Company announced the Volkswagen as the first automaker to offer Bluetooth enabled mirror for home automation that works in conjunction with HomeLink Connect . The Company further continues to work with compatibility partners for HomeLink applications in other markets, like China. The unique attributes of the China market allow for potential different use cases of these products and offer the potential for additional growth opportunities for the HomeLink brand and products. In 2017, the Company began its first volume production shipments of HomeLink units on vehicles for the China market. 
 
 In 2016, the Company announced a partnership with TransCore to provide automobile manufacturers with a vehicle-integrated tolling solution that enables motorists to drive on nearly all U.S. toll roads without a traditional toll tag on the windshield. Currently more than 75 percent of new car registrations are in states with toll roads with over 50 million drivers accessing these roads each year. The interior mirror is the optimal location for a vehicle-integrated toll transponder and it eliminates the need to affix multiple toll tags to the windshield and helps automakers seamlessly integrate toll collection into the car. Since the Integrated Toll Module or ITM enables travel across almost all United States toll roads, and others in North America, motorists would no longer need multiple toll tags for different regions of the country or to manage multiple toll accounts. The Company's vehicle-integrated solution simplifies and expedites local, regional, and national travel. ITM provides transportation agencies with an interoperability solution without costly infrastructure changes to the thousands of miles of toll lanes throughout North America. The Company believes that this product still potentially represents another growth opportunity over the next several years. 
 
 The Company previously announced its first OEM award of ITM with Audi. Currently, the Company is shipping ITM on 11 Audi platforms, which are: the A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, Q5, Q5 Sportback, Q7, Q8, e-tron, and the e-tron Sportback. The Company expects further ITM nameplate launches with Audi throughout the remainder of 2024. The Company is also shipping ITM to a second OEM customer, Mercedes, on the EQS model. In 2020, the Company was honored with an Automotive News PACE Award for its ITM product, which recognizes automotive suppliers for superior innovation, technological advancement, and business performance. 
 
 Further, the Company has previously announced an embedded biometric solution for vehicles that leverages iris scanning technology to create a secure environment in the vehicle. There are many use cases for authentication, which range from vehicle security to start functionality to personalization of mirrors, music, seat location and temperature, to the ability to control transactions not only for the ITM system, but also the ride sharing car of the future. The Company believes iris recognition is among the most secure forms of biometric identification, with a false acceptance rate as low as one in 10 million, far superior to facial, voice, and other current biometric systems. The Company's future plans include integrating biometric authentication with HomeLink and HomeLink Connect . The biometric system will allow HomeLink to provide added security and convenience for multiple drivers by activating the unique home automation presets of different authorized users. The Company announced in 2018 that it completed an exclusive licensing agreement, in the ordinary course of business, with Fingerprint Cards AB to deploy its ActiveIRIS iris-scanning biometric technology in automotive applications. 
 
 In 2020, the Company announced a partnership, in the ordinary course of business, with PayByCar , to pursue compatibility between the Company's Integrated Toll Module and PayByCar's innovative payment solution that allows drivers to use their smartphones and toll transponder to fuel up at certain gas stations without using cash or a credit card. Compatibility between these two technologies can help to grow each company's respective consumer base, while introducing new users to the benefits of the transactional vehicle. 
 
 In 2021, the Company announced a partnership, in the ordinary course of business, with Simplenight to provide drivers and vehicle occupants with access to enhanced mobile capability for booking personalized entertainment and lifestyle experiences in addition to everyday purchases. Simplenight delivers a 
 30 

customizable and robust platform that enables brands to globally offer real-time book-ability across multiple categories such as dining, accommodations, attractions, events, gas, parking, shopping and more. The platform is unique in that it is designed to seamlessly integrate into automaker infotainment and navigation systems, as well as mobile applications and voice assistants. Simplenight can be integrated into the Company's current and future connected vehicle technologies, including HomeLink , which, again, is the automotive industry s leading car-to-home automation system. HomeLink consists of vehicle-integrated buttons that can be programmed to operate a myriad of home automation devices. Integration of Simplenight into the Company's HomeLink Connect app is underway and will allow users to program their HomeLink buttons and control cloud-based devices from their vehicles. 
 
 Dimmable Devices 
 
 The Company previously announced that it is providing variably dimmable windows for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner series of aircraft. The Company continues to work with other aircraft manufacturers that have an interest in this technology regarding potential additional programs. In 2019, the Company announced that its latest generation of dimmable aircraft windows will be offered as optional content on the new Boeing 777X. In 2019, the first production shipments of variably dimmable windows were made to Boeing for the 777X program. As also previously announced, Airbus is now offering, as optional content, the Company's dimmable aircraft windows on its aircraft, with production having begun in 2021. 
 
 Medical 
 
 In 2020, the Company unveiled an innovative lighting technology for medical applications that was co-developed with Mayo Clinic. This new lighting concept represents the collaboration of a global, high-technology electronics company with a world leader in health care. The Company's new intelligent lighting system combines ambient room lighting with camera-controlled, adaptive task lighting to optimize illumination for surgical and patient-care environments. The system was developed over an 18 month period of collaboration between Company engineers and Mayo Clinic surgeons, scientists, and operating room staff. The teams researched, designed, and rapidly iterated multiple prototypes in order to develop unique features intended to address major gaps in current surgical lighting solutions. In 2024, the Company continues to further develop and work on the intelligent medical lighting system in order to assess system performance and work toward obtaining any necessary approvals. 
 
 On November 2, 2023, in the ordinary course of business, the Company acquired certain technology assets from eSight Corporation for approximately 18.9 million in cash, the assumption of a 9.4 million promissory note given in exchange for the 20 equity the Company previously held, as well as an earn out provision over a ten year period. The technology acquired from eSight provides the most advanced and versatile low-vision smart glasses available for those with visual impairments and is compatible with more than 20 eye conditions including Macular Degeneration, Diabetic Retinopathy, and Stargardt disease. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded its first official sales of medical devices of 0.8 million from shipments of the previously acquired e-Sight Go product. 
 
 OTHER 
 
 Automotive revenues represent approximately 97 - 99 of the Company's total revenue, consisting of interior and exterior electrochromic automatic-dimming rearview mirrors and automotive electronics. 
 
 The Company continues to experience pricing pressure from automotive customers and competitors, in addition to raw material cost increases, labor cost increases, and logistics cost increases, which will continue to cause downward pressure on its sales and profit margins. The Company works continuously to offset these supply chain issues and inflationary pressures with engineering and purchasing cost reductions, productivity improvements, increases in unit sales volume, and negotiations with customers to reduce the impact of the inflationary pressures, but there is no assurance the Company will be able to do so in the future. 
 
 Because the Company sells its products throughout the world, and automotive manufacturing is highly dependent on economic conditions, the Company can be affected by uncertain economic conditions that 
 31 

can reduce demand for its products, including the current inflationary environment. The Company has been likewise affected by industry-wide parts shortages and global supply constraints and labor shortages. 
 
 The Company believes that its patents and trade secrets provide it with a competitive advantage in dimmable devices, electronics, and other features that it offers for the automotive, aerospace, and medical industry. Claims of patent infringement can be costly and time-consuming to address. To that end, the Company obtains intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of business to strengthen its intellectual property portfolio and to minimize the risk of infringement. 
 
 The Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments that have not been recorded in its consolidated financial statements.

OUTLOOK 
 
 The Company s current forecasts for light vehicle production for the fourth quarter of 2024, and full years 2024 and 2025, are based on the mid-October 2024 S P Global Mobility forecast for light vehicle production in North America, Europe, Japan/Korea, and China. Fourth quarter of 2024, and calendar years 2024 and 2025, forecasted light vehicle production volumes are shown below: 
 
 Light Vehicle Production (per S P Global Mobility mid-October light vehicle production forecast) (in Millions) Region Q4 2024 Q4 2023 Change Calendar Year 2025 Calendar Year 2024 Calendar Year 2023 2025 vs 2024 Change 2024 vs 2023 Change North America 3.64 3.76 (3) 15.29 15.47 15.68 (1) (1) Europe 4.24 4.66 (9) 17.00 17.07 17.97 (5) Japan and Korea 3.20 3.38 (5) 12.02 12.00 12.80 (6) China 8.69 8.81 (1) 30.02 29.34 29.04 2 1 Total Light Vehicle Production 19.77 20.61 (4) 74.33 73.88 75.49 1 (2) 
 Based on the aforementioned light vehicle production forecast and the actual results for the first nine months of 2024, the Company previously updated certain guidance for calendar year 2024 as shown below. 
 Revenue is expected to be between 2.35 and 2.40 billion 
 Gross Margin is expected to be between 33.5 and 34.0 
 Operating Expenses are expected to be approximately 295 to 305 million 
 Estimated Annual Tax Rate, which assumes no changes to the statutory rate, is expected to be between 15 and 15.5 
 Capital Expenditures are expected to be between 150 and 175 million 
 Depreciation and Amortization is expected to be between 90 and 95 million 
 
 Due to ongoing volatility in customer orders and vehicle production volumes, the Ukraine-Russia war, Israel-Hamas war, labor shortages, and overall economic uncertainty, the Company believes that revenue remains difficult to forecast for the remainder of the year and beyond. Ongoing uncertainties remain, including: light vehicle production levels; impacts of already in place and potential additional future tariffs; impacts of regulation changes; automotive plant shutdowns; vehicle sales rates in Europe, Asia and North America; OEM strategies and cost pressures; customer inventory management and the impact of potential automotive customer (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and supplier bankruptcies; etc., all of which are disrupting and could further disrupt shipments to these customers and make forecasting difficult. 
 
 In accordance with the previously announced share repurchase plan, the Company will consider the appropriateness of continuing to repurchase additional shares of common stock in the future in support of the capital allocation strategy, but share repurchases will vary from time to time and will take into account macroeconomic events, market trends, and other factors the Company deems appropriate (including the market price of the stock, anti-dilutive effect of repurchases, and available cash). As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 10.1 million shares remaining available for repurchase under the previously announced share repurchase plan. 
 Additionally, based on the Company s current forecasts for light vehicle production for calendar year 2025, the Company expects calendar year 2025 revenue of approximately 2.45 to 2.55 billion. As noted above, continuing uncertainties make forecasting difficult.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES: 
 The preparation of the Company s consolidated condensed financial statements contained in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates. Estimates are based on historical experience and/or on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Historically, actual results have not been materially different from the Company s estimates. However, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 The Company has identified critical accounting policies used in determining estimates and assumptions in the amounts reported in its Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 The Company is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities, including foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. Fluctuating interest rates could negatively impact the Company's financial performance due to realized losses on the sale of fixed income investments and/or recognized losses due to an impairment adjustment on investment securities, as well as the impact on demand for light vehicles. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, any material changes in risk factors that were disclosed in the Company's report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 are set forth herein. 
 The Company has some assets, liabilities, and operations outside the United States, including euro-denominated and Chinese Yuan Renminbi accounts, which currently are not significant overall to the Company as a whole. Because the Company sells its automotive mirrors throughout the world, and automotive manufacturing is highly dependent on general economic conditions and the global supply chain, the Company has been and will continue to be affected by uncertain economic conditions in North American and foreign markets, including inflation, that have reduced, and could continue to reduce, demand for its products. 
 
 Item 4. Controls And Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . 
 
 Under the supervision of, and with the participation of management, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024, and have concluded that as of that date, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
