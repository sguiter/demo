 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company believes that its present balance of cash resources and securities coupled with cash inflows from product sales will enable the Company to fund its operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the financial statements. Actual cash requirements could differ from management's projections for many reasons, including changes the Company may make to its business strategy, commercial challenges, regulatory developments, changes to research and development programs, supply chain issues, staffing challenges and other items affecting the Company's projected uses of cash. 
 
 During February 2024, the Company announced that it would undertake a review of its strategic options to maximize shareholder value. These options include changes in marketing strategies, the acquisition of new assets, potential sale of Company assets, and a merger or other strategic transaction. This review process remains ongoing. A timetable for completion of this process has not been established, and even if certain strategic alternatives may be available, the Company cannot provide any assurance that the strategic alternatives review process will result in the successful realization of any particular alternative, transaction or value. Accordingly, the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For a description of factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, please refer to the below section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to we , us , the Company , or NeuroMetrix in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to NeuroMetrix, Inc. 

Business Overview 
 
 NeuroMetrix is a commercial stage neurotechnology company based in Woburn, Massachusetts. The Company s mission is to improve individual and population health through innovative medical devices and technology solutions for pain syndromes and neurological disorders. Our core expertise in biomedical engineering has been refined over two decades of designing, building and marketing medical devices that stimulate nerves and analyze nerve response for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. We are fully integrated with in-house capabilities spanning research and development, manufacturing, regulatory affairs and compliance, sales and marketing, product fulfillment and customer support. We hold extensive, proprietary intellectual property. 
 
 NeuroMetrix created the market for point-of-care nerve testing and introduced sophisticated wearable technology for chronic pain syndromes. Nearly five million patients have been served with our products. Revenue is derived from the sale of medical devices, after-market consumable products and accessories in the United States and select overseas markets. Products 
 12 

are authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and regulators in foreign jurisdictions where appropriate. We have two principal product categories: 
 
 Therapeutic technology wearable neuromodulation for chronic pain syndromes 
 Diagnostic technology - point-of-care peripheral neuropathy assessment 
 
 Chronic pain is a significant public health problem. It is defined by the National Institutes of Health (the "NIH") as pain lasting more than 12 weeks. This contrasts with acute pain which is a normal bodily response to injury or trauma. Chronic pain conditions include low back pain, arthritis, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, and cancer pain, among many others. Chronic pain 
 may be triggered by an injury or there may be an ongoing cause such as disease or illness. There may also be no clear cause. Chronic pain can also lead to other health problems including fatigue, sleep disturbance and mood changes, which cause difficulty in carrying out important activities and contribute to disability and despair. In general, chronic pain cannot be cured. Treatment of chronic pain is focused on reducing pain and improving function. The goal is effective pain management. 
 
 Chronic pain affects nearly 100 million adults in the United States and more than 1.5 billion people worldwide. The estimated incremental impact of chronic pain on health care costs in the United States is over 250 billion per year, and lost productivity is estimated to exceed 300 billion per year. The most common approach to chronic pain management is pain medication. This includes over-the-counter internal and external analgesics as well as prescription pain medications, both non-opioid and opioids. The approach to treatment is individualized, drug combinations may be employed, and the results are often inadequate. Side effects, including the potential for addiction, are substantial. Reflecting the complexity of chronic pain and the difficulty in treating it, we believe that inadequate relief leads 25 to 50 of pain sufferers to seek alternatives to prescription pain medications. These alternatives include nutraceuticals, acupuncture, chiropractic care, non-prescription analgesics, electrical stimulators, braces, sleeves, pads and other items. In total, these pain relief products and services account for approximately 20 billion in annual out-of-pocket spending in the United States. 
 
 Nerve stimulation is a long-established category of treatment for chronic pain. This treatment approach is available through implantable devices which have both surgical and ongoing risks, such as migration of the implanted nerve stimulation leads. Non-invasive approaches involving transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ("TENS") have achieved limited efficacy in practice due to power limitations, inadequate dosing and low patient adherence. We believe that our Quell wearable technology for chronic pain is designed to address many of the limitations of traditional TENS. 
 
 Peripheral neuropathies, or polyneuropathies, are diseases of the peripheral nerves. They affect about 10 of adults in the United States, with the prevalence rising to over 30 among individuals 65 years and older. Peripheral neuropathies are associated with loss of sensation, pain, increased risk of falling, weakness, and other complications. People with peripheral neuropathies have a diminished quality of life, poor overall health and higher mortality. The most common specific cause of peripheral neuropathies, accounting for about one-third of cases, is diabetes. Diabetes is a worldwide epidemic with an estimated affected population of over 400 million people. Within the United States there are over 30 million people with diabetes and another 80 million with pre-diabetes. The annual direct cost of treating diabetes in the United States exceeds 100 billion. Although there are dangerous acute manifestations of diabetes, the primary burden of the disease is in its long-term complications, which include cardiovascular disease, nerve disease and resulting conditions such as foot ulcers which may require amputation, eye disease leading to blindness, and kidney failure. The most common long-term complication of diabetes, affecting over 50 of the diabetic population, is peripheral neuropathy. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy ("DPN") is the primary trigger for diabetic foot ulcers which may progress to the point of requiring amputation. People with diabetes have a 15 to 25 lifetime risk of foot ulcers and approximately 15 of foot ulcers lead to amputation. Foot ulcers are the most expensive complication of diabetes with a typical cost of 5,000 to 50,000 per episode. In addition, between 16 and 26 of people with diabetes suffer from chronic pain in their feet and lower legs. 
 
 Early detection of peripheral neuropathies, such as DPN, is important because there are no treatment options once the nerves have degenerated. Currently available diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathies range from a simple monofilament test for lack of sensory perception in the feet to a nerve conduction study performed by a specialist. Our DPNCheck nerve conduction technology provides a rapid, low cost, quantitative test for peripheral neuropathies, including DPN. It addresses an important medical need and is particularly effective in screening large populations. DPNCheck has been validated in multiple clinical studies. 
 
 Business Strategy 
 
 Our leading commercial products, and the focus of our strategic attention, are Quell and DPNCheck. 
 13 

Quell is our wearable neuromodulation technology for chronic pain. It has been refined over the past seven years with feedback from over 200,000 chronic pain patients and is protected by over 20 U.S. utility patents. Patients control and personalize the technology with a mobile phone app, and their utilization of the devices and certain clinical metrics may be tracked in the Quell Health Cloud. The degree of technological sophistication, combined with our extensive consumer experience and the compelling results of clinical studies, gives us the opportunity to leverage this technology base into a portfolio of Quell-based prescription ("Rx") wearable neurotherapeutics. 
 
 Quell received Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA for a fibromyalgia indication in 2021 leading to the FDA granting a De Novo marketing authorization for the use of Quell as an aid for reducing the symptoms of fibromyalgia in adults with high pain sensitivity. This Rx product was introduced to the domestic market in late 2022 under a controlled, strategic commercial launch with the objectives to develop an effective Rx fulfillment process, identify the higher-potential market sectors and an efficient marketing approach, and implement a cost-effective sales model. This led to the engagement of Health Warehouse as our on-line pharmacy, the introduction of a telemedicine option to facilitate patient prescriptions, higher electrode refill pricing, a focus on Veterans Administration patients and a shift to variable cost contractor sales versus an employee sales force. Many of these commercial efforts are being implemented. The Company is considering the reactivation of its promotion of Quell OTC for lower extremity chronic pain during the fourth quarter of 2024 or early 2025. 
 
 Quell also received FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in early 2022 for the treatment of chronic Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy ("CIPN"). A CIPN double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical study employing Quell, funded by the National Cancer Institute and the NIH, was completed in 2023. A 510(k) marketing application was submitted to FDA in late 2023; however, after evaluating the unique characteristics of the oncology market, the Company decided to follow the De Novo model that was used for Quell-fibromyalgia. A De Novo application for marketing Quell-CIPN to patients with moderate to severe neuropathic pain and cramps is planned for filing in late 2024 or early 2025. This would be the second product in our emerging portfolio of Quell-based Rx wearable therapeutics. We anticipate a similar approach to other disease indications involving chronic pain. These potentially include Fibromyalgia-like Long COVID, Chronic Low Back Pain, and Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions. 
 
 DPNCheck is our well-established testing technology for peripheral neuropathies. This technology has been evaluated in multiple clinical studies and promoted both in the domestic Medicare Advantage ("MA") market and also in the Asian markets of Japan and China. MA has historically contributed the majority of DPNCheck revenue and been the driver of product-line growth. 
 
 During 2023, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid ("CMS") implemented significant changes to its MA Hierarchical Condition Categories ("HCC") risk adjustment payments and to its MA Risk Adjustment Data Validation ("RADV") audit practices. The changes to HCC risk factor coding significantly reduced CMS payments for population screening for various conditions, including for neuropathy, and resulted in a significant reduction in our DPNCheck sales. As a result, we have reduced our commercial sales team while continuing to support our customer base and attract new accounts. It is unlikely that there will be a near-term recovery from the decline in revenue of the DPNCheck MA business. DPNCheck sales in Asian markets are not affected by the reimbursement changes in MA. 
 
 Production and marketing of ADVANCE, a legacy, point-of-care neurodiagnostic technology primarily used for the diagnosis and screening for carpal tunnel syndrome, was discontinued in 2012. Our support to an eroding customer base of ADVANCE was terminated on July 31, 2024. 
 
 Strategy Review 
 
 The Company has initiated a review of its strategic options to promote growth of Quell and DPNCheck and to maximize shareholder value. The review covers a wide range of options including potential changes in marketing strategies, the acquisition of new assets, potential sale of Company assets, and a merger or other strategic transaction. A timetable for completion of this process has not been set and the Company will continue to promote its commercial operations while the review is being conducted. The Company has utilized outside professional services in conducting its review, expanded its Board of Directors, curtailed its equity offerings, and implemented a reduction-in-force to reduce its operating costs. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no other material strategic transactions or decisions that would warrant disclosure.

 Revenues 
 
 Revenues for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 616 thousand or 51.2 from the third quarter of 2023. DPNCheck sales accounted for the majority of revenues in both quarters and were the primary contributor to the revenue decline in the third quarter of 2024. The DPNCheck sales decline was primarily attributable to adverse CMS reimbursement changes in the Medicare Advantage market initiated in 2023 and scheduled to be phased in over a three year period which have reduced patient screening by healthcare providers for various conditions, including neuropathy. International sales of DPNCheck also declined from the prior year quarter due to excess inventory at the Japan distributor. The Company believes this situation is transient, and these biosensor orders should resume in the first quarter of 2025. Quell sales made a small contribution to offsetting the DPNCheck sales reduction in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 470 thousand or 60.1 from the third quarter of 2023. Gross profit reflected a 53.1 gross margin rate in comparison with 65.0 in the prior year quarter. The decline in revenue, particularly DPNCheck revenue, was the largest contributor to the reduction in gross profit. The gross profit rate contraction reflected reduced weighting by DPNCheck, the Company s highest margin product line. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses declined in the third quarter of 2024 by 689 thousand or 25.1 from the third quarter of 2023. The primary contributors were cost benefits from the reduction in employee headcount in the first quarter of 2024 partially offset by increased professional service fees related to the business strategy review. Research and development spending in the third quarter of 2024 of 300 thousand decreased by 293 thousand from 2023 due primarily to a reduction in personnel costs of 275 thousand. Sales and marketing spending of 441 thousand decreased by 503 thousand from 2023 due primarily to a reduction of personnel costs of 374 thousand from 2023. General and administrative costs of 1.3 million increased by 107 thousand from 2023 reflecting higher professional fees of 122 thousand largely attributable to the business strategy review (legal and banking fees). 
 
 Net loss 
 
 The net loss in the third quarter of 2024 of 1.5 million decreased by 261 thousand from the third quarter of 2023. Net loss per common share was 0.75) versus 1.66) per common share in the third quarter of 2024. Per share amounts reflect 2.0 million shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2024 versus 1.1 million shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2023.

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Nine months ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Amount Percent Revenues 2,450,018 4,583,679 (2,133,661) (46.5) Gross profit 1,320,893 3,099,439 (1,778,546) (57.4) of revenues

 Revenues 
 
 Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 2.1 million or 46.5 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. DPNCheck sales, primarily focused on MA, accounted for the majority of revenues in both quarters and the decline in DPNCheck sales was the primary contributor to the revenue decrease. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.8 million or 57.4 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in revenue, particularly DPNCheck revenue, was the largest contributor to the reduction in gross profit. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 248 thousand or 3.0 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Increased general and administrative spending of 854 thousand was offset by reduced research and development spending of 535 thousand and reduced sales and marketing spending of 567 thousand. Higher general and administrative spending was largely attributable to costs associated with the strategic review process. 
 
 Net loss 
 
 The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.1 million compared to 2023. Net loss per common share was 3.10) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 4.86) per common share in 2023. The increase in the number of common shares outstanding in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (2.0 million) versus common shares outstanding in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (1.0 million) offset the effect of a greater net loss in the current year period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 2023 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 14,834,600 17,637,675 17,997,151 Working capital 15,585,819 19,445,277 19,613,803 Current ratio 13.9 16.4 16.8 Net debt position (13,624,729) (16,254,439) (16,664,027) Days sales outstanding 32.9 50.9 35.6 Inventory turnover 0.8 1.0 1.2 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, securities, revenues from the sales of our products, and net proceeds from equity sales. Our expected cash outlays relate to funding operations. We believe that our resources are sufficient to fund our cash requirements over at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the financial statements. As indicated above, we have initiated a review of our strategic options to maximize shareholder value. These options include changes in marketing strategies, the acquisition of new assets, potential sale of Company assets, and a merger or other strategic transaction, which could affect our future liquidity. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 15.6 million, including 14.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and a current ratio of 13.9. We had no term debt or borrowings. Net debt, defined as short and long-term debts, less cash, cash equivalents and securities, continues to be negative. 
 
 Days sales outstanding ("DSO") reflect our customer payment terms which vary from payment on order to 60 days from shipment date. The decrease in DSO in 2024 in comparison with the prior year reflects a greater weighting during 2024 of cash sales as compared to credit sales. Inventory turnover rate declined during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 due to the lower DPNCheck sales. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 
 (5,238,316) (4,634,367) (603,949) Investing activities

 1,473,700 701,546 772,154 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (810,426) (2,874,467) 
 
 Operating activities 
 
 Cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 604 thousand from the comparable period in 2023. This primarily reflects the increased net loss in the period. 

Investing activities 
 
 Investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect 29.0 million in purchases of AFS securities offset by proceeds from maturity of AFS securities of 32.0 million. During the comparable period in 2023, investing activities reflected 22.9 million in purchases of AFS securities offset by proceeds from maturity of AFS and HTM securities of 24.1 
 17 

million. The differences in investing activities between the two periods are due to variations in duration and maturity of individual securities in the Company s securities portfolio as well as shifts in portfolio assets to fund operating activities. 
 
 Financing activities 
 
 Equity sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 contributed 1.5 million and 701 thousand, respectively. Shares of our common stock were sold to investors pursuant to the Company's at-the-market facility which was terminated during the second quarter of 2024.

The words believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, expect, plan and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. The forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described in the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts. Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents and available for sale debt securities. We consider investments that, when purchased, have a remaining maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The primary objectives of our investment strategy are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs, and maximize yields. To minimize our exposure to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest mainly in cash equivalents and investments with a maturity of twelve months or less and we maintain an average maturity of twelve months or less. We do not believe that a notional or hypothetical 10 change in interest rate percentages would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or our interest income.
