common shares for eligible employees, non-employee directors, consultants, and advisors to the Company to be granted in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units RSUs ), stock appreciation rights, performance-based stock units PSUs ), and performance-based cash awards (collectively, awards ). As of September 30, 2024, common shares are available for issuance under the 2020 Plan. 
 
 The Company has issued restricted stock and RSUs, which are treated as equity awards and recorded at their fair value using the closing stock price on the grant date. Compensation expense is generally recognized over a service period specified within each award with a corresponding credit to shareholders equity using the straight-line method until the vesting date specified within each award or until the employee becomes eligible for retirement, if earlier than the vesting date. Compensation expense for subsequent equity awards to an employee who is retirement eligible is recognized immediately upon the grant date. 
 
 The Company also has PSUs issued and outstanding which contain Company performance-based and market performance-based conditions. PSUs subject to Company performance-based conditions are initially recognized as equity at their fair value which is measured using the closing stock price on the grant date multiplied by the number of units expected to vest based on an assessment of the probability of achievement of the Company performance-based conditions as of the grant date. The grant date fair value is recognized as expense using the straight-line method until the earlier of the vesting date specified within each award or the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement. Adjustments are made, if necessary, based on any change in probability of achievement which is re-assessed as of each reporting date and on at least a quarterly basis. PSUs subject to market performance-based conditions are recognized as equity at their grant date fair value determined through a Monte-Carlo simulation of the Company s common stock total shareholder return TSR relative to the common stock TSR of the group of peer companies specified in the award agreement. Awards subject to market performance-based conditions are not assessed for probability of achievement and are not remeasured subsequent to issuance. The grant date fair value is recognized as expense using the straight-line method until the earlier of the vesting date specified within each award or the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement, even if the market performance-based conditions are not achieved. 
 
 The Company does not estimate forfeitures for any of its share-based compensation awards but adjusts for actual forfeitures in the periods in which they occur. Because RSUs and PSUs have forfeitable dividend equivalent rights, which are paid in cash only upon settlement, any accrued dividend equivalent rights DERs on forfeited units are reversed with a corresponding credit to Compensation and benefits expense.

 The unrealized losses on the Company s MBS designated as AFS were the result of rising interest rates and declines in market prices and were not credit related; therefore, the Company did have any allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Although the unrealized losses are not credit related, the Company assesses its ability and intent to hold any MBS with an unrealized loss until the recovery in its value. This assessment is based on the amount of the unrealized loss and significance of the related investment as well as the Company s leverage and liquidity position. In addition, for its non-Agency MBS, the Company reviews the credit

The Company had borrowings outstanding under different repurchase agreements as of September 30, 2024, and its equity at risk did not exceed 10 with any counterparty as of that date. The Company received noncash collateral with a fair value of million pledged by its counterparties to compensate the Company for the increase in fair value of collateral previously pledged in excess of required margin related to its repurchase agreement borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 860, the fair value of this noncash collateral is not recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet unless the Company re-pledges the collateral or sells the collateral in the event of default by the counterparty.

In addition, some of the agreements contain cross default features, whereby default under an agreement with one lender simultaneously causes default under agreements with other lenders.

As of September 30, 2024, the fair value measurements for the Company s TBA securities and its MBS are considered Level 2 because there are substantially similar securities actively trading or for which there has been recent trading activity in their respective markets and are based on prices received from a pricing service. In valuing a security, the pricing service primarily uses a market approach, which uses observable prices and other relevant information that is generated by market transactions of identical or similar securities, but may use an income approach, which uses valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow modeling. The Company reviews the prices it receives from the pricing service as well as the assumptions and inputs, if any, utilized by the pricing service for reasonableness. Examples of the observable inputs and assumptions include market interest rates, credit spreads, and projected prepayment speeds, among other things. In addition, the prices received from the pricing service are assessed for reasonableness using broker quotes as well as other third-party pricing services. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's mortgage loans held for investment are single-family mortgage loans, which were originated or purchased by the Company prior to 2000, and for which the Company has elected the fair value option. The fair value measurements for these mortgage loans are considered Level 3 because there has been no recent trading activity of similar instruments upon which their fair value can be measured. The fair value for these Level 3 assets is measured by discounting the estimated future cash flows derived from cash flow models using certain inputs such as the security s credit rating, coupon rate, estimated prepayment speeds, expected weighted average life, collateral composition, and expected credit losses as well as certain other relevant information. The Company used a constant prepayment rate assumption of , default rate of , loss severity of , and a discount rate of in measuring the fair value of its Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2024.

 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 
 The headline for the third quarter of 2024 was the 50 basis point cut to the U.S. Federal Funds rate at the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting; the first rate cut since the Federal Reserve started raising rates in 2022. The rate cut was long awaited and was in reaction to weakening labor market conditions. The Federal Reserve is signaling its desire make proactive adjustments while labor markets are still generally strong and to deliver on its goal of price stability. The anticipated and actual cuts drove the 10-year U.S. Treasury down from 4.40 at the end of the second quarter of 2024 to 3.78 at the end of the third quarter. MBS spreads were broadly tighter during the third quarter of 2024, but had an upswing from mid-September through the end of the quarter.

Summary of Results 
 
 The Company increased book value by 0.50 per common share this quarter driven by the outperformance of MBS and TBAs over losses on the hedge book. Rates trended down for most of the quarter, and MBS spreads were broadly tighter during the third quarter, with significant performance divergence between coupons. In addition, we added 56.8 million of new capital to deploy into MBS opportunities. We added 1.5 billion of swaps during the quarter on which we received net periodic interest benefit of 4.2 million to offset financing costs.

 Current Outlook 
 Global economic conditions, geopolitical risk and the U.S. election continue to be a focus for the Company. U.S. economic growth remains modest, inflation has declined closer to the Federal Reserve s target, and monetary policy appears likely to be less restrictive. The broader investment environment remains favorable with mortgage spreads near historic wides. With a steeper yield curve, the opportunities to earn carry and experience appreciation on our bonds are growing. The yield curve shows forward financing costs declining well into 2025. We also expect the environment will be favorable for our hedging portfolio and to continue to lock in more compelling yields on our hedges as SOFR swap rates offer increasing returns. In the intermediate term, we believe equilibrium Agency RMBS spreads will be significantly tighter than market levels available today.

 (1) Implied cost basis of TBAs represents the forward price to be paid for the underlying Agency MBS. 
 (2) Fair value of TBAs is the implied market value of the underlying Agency security as of the end of the period. 
 (3) TBAs are included on the consolidated balance sheet within derivative assets/liabilities at their net carrying value which is the difference between their implied market value and implied cost basis. Please refer to Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 (4) TBAs are excluded from this calculation as they do not have a defined weighted-average loan balance or age until mortgages have been assigned to the pool. 
 (5) Constant prepayment rate CPR represents the 3-month CPR of Agency RMBS held as of date indicated. 
 (6) Duration measures the sensitivity of a security's price to the change in interest rates and represents the percent change in price of a security for a 100-basis point increase in interest rates. We calculate duration using third-party financial models and empirical data. Different models and methodologies can produce different estimates of duration for the same securities. 
 (7) Represents the weighted average market yield projected using cash flows generated off the forward curve based on market prices as of the date indicated and assuming zero volatility. 
 
 Less than 3 of our MBS portfolio as of September 30, 2024 is comprised of Agency CMBS, Agency CMBS IO, and non-Agency CMBS IO. Our Agency CMBS and Agency CMBS IO are backed by loans collateralized by multifamily properties, which have performed well for the last decade versus other sectors of the commercial real estate market. Our Agency CMBS IO are Class X1 from Freddie Mac Series K deals from which interest continues to be advanced even in the event of an underlying default up until liquidation. According to Freddie Mac, 99.8 of the loans in K-deals are current as of August 2024. Our non-Agency CMBS IO were all originated prior to 2018 with a weighted average remaining life of less than 2 years. The underlying loans for the non-Agency CMBS IO securities are collateralized by a number of different property types including: 27 retail, 26 office, 17 multifamily, 11 hotel and 19 all other real estate categories. In the current macroeconomic environment, we are not actively purchasing CMBS or CMBS IO as current risk versus reward remains unattractive relative to Agency RMBS.

 Net Interest Income 
 Interest income and effective yield for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 due primarily to the addition of higher coupon Agency RMBS. We expect this trend to continue as our higher yielding Agency RMBS comprise a larger portion of our interest income and as our lower yielding Agency RMBS continue to pay down. Our interest expense increased compared to the prior quarter due to the increase in our average balance of repurchase agreement borrowings, although our financing cost as a percentage of our average borrowing declined for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter.

(2) Average balance for liabilities is calculated as a simple average of the daily borrowings outstanding during the period. 
 (3) Effective yield is calculated by dividing interest income by the average balance of asset type outstanding during the reporting period. Unscheduled adjustments to premium/discount amortization/accretion, such as for prepayment compensation, are not annualized in this calculation. 
 (4) Financing cost is calculated by dividing annualized interest expense by the total average balance of borrowings outstanding during the period with an assumption of 360 days in a year.

 In addition to lower financing costs for our repurchase agreement borrowings, we recognized a net periodic interest benefit of 4.2 million from short positions in interest rate swaps during the third quarter of 2024, which we expect will continue to partially offset our repurchase agreement financing costs in the coming months. 
 
 Gains (Losses) on Investments and Derivative Instruments 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of our investment portfolio increased as a result of spread tightening and the decline in the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate as investors gained confidence that the Federal Reserve is on a path of lowering the Federal Funds rate. The resulting gains on our investment portfolio outpaced the losses on our interest rate hedges created by the decline in rates. 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate increased 20 basis points. The impact of this rate increase on our investments was mitigated by the resulting gains on our interest rate hedges of 64.1 million. The net loss of (2.6) million on our investments, net of our interest rate hedges, was primarily driven by spread widening on Agency RMBS versus U.S. Treasuries.

 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.5 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in the Company s performance based bonus accrual for employees based on projected results for the year.

 Net Interest Expense 
 Net interest expense and net interest spread improved for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Though our interest expense increased due to a higher average balance of repurchase agreement borrowings at a higher financing rate, additions of higher yielding Agency RMBS to our investment portfolio over the past year increased our interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by approximately 76 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Gains (Losses) on Investments and Derivative Instruments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gains on our investment portfolio exceeded losses on our interest rate hedging portfolio by 115.2 million primarily because we purchased higher coupon investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when spreads were wider versus spreads as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the fair value of our investment portfolio declined (313.3) million primarily as a result of higher interest rates and significant spread widening across most asset classes. These losses were mitigated by net gains from our interest rate hedges of 276.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 2) Realized gain (loss) for interest rate swaps includes net periodic interest benefit earned as well as amounts recognized or incurred upon maturity or termination, if applicable, during the period indicated. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.2 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to accelerated recognition of share-based compensation expense for certain stock incentive awards granted in March 2024 to a retirement eligible employee. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In evaluating the Company s financial and operating performance, management considers book value per common share, total economic return (loss) to common shareholders, and other operating results presented in accordance with GAAP as well as earnings available for distribution EAD to common shareholders (including per common share), a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because management uses it as a measure of the investment portfolio s return based on the effective yield of its investments, net of financing costs and other normal recurring operating income/expenses. Drop income generated by TBA dollar roll positions, which is included in "gain (loss) on derivatives instruments, net" on the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income, is included in EAD because management views drop income as the economic equivalent of net interest income (interest income less implied financing cost) on the underlying Agency security from trade date to settlement date. Management also includes periodic interest benefit/cost from its interest rate swaps, which are included in "gain (loss) on derivatives instruments, net", in EAD because interest rate swaps are used by the Company to economically hedge the impact of changing interest rates on its borrowing costs from repurchase agreements, and including periodic interest benefit/cost from interest rate swaps is a helpful indicator of the Company s total financing cost in addition to GAAP interest expense. However, non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP earnings and may not be comparable to similarly titled 
 measures of other REITs because they may not be calculated in the same manner. Furthermore, though EAD is one of several factors our management considers in determining the appropriate level of distributions to common shareholders, it should not be utilized in isolation, and it is not an accurate indication of the Company s REIT taxable income or its distribution requirements in accordance with the Tax Code. 
 Reconciliations of EAD to common shareholders to certain GAAP financial measures are provided below.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include borrowings under repurchase arrangements and monthly principal and interest payments we receive on our investments. Additional sources may also include proceeds from the sale of investments, equity offerings, and net payments received from counterparties for derivative instruments. We use our liquidity to purchase investments, to pay amounts due on our repurchase agreement borrowings, and to pay our operating expenses and dividends on our common and preferred stock. We also use our liquidity to meet margin requirements for our repurchase agreements and derivative transactions, including TBA contracts, under the terms of the related agreements. We may also periodically use liquidity to repurchase shares of the Company s stock. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 10,500,000 shares of common stock through a public offering, resulting in proceeds of 124.5 million, net of issuance costs. We also issued 11,559,359 shares of common stock through our ATM program, resulting in proceeds of 143.2 million, net of broker commissions and fees. We partially deployed these proceeds into purchases of specified pools of higher coupon Agency RMBS. We are reserving a portion of the proceeds in order to navigate through potential volatility and to deploy into additional investments as spreads widen during the remainder of 2024. 
 Our liquidity fluctuates based on our investment activities, our leverage, capital raising activities, and changes in the fair value of our investments and derivative instruments. Our measurement of liquidity includes unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered Agency MBS, which are recognized as assets on our 
 consolidated balance sheet. We also include in our measure of liquidity the fair value of noncash collateral pledged to us by our counterparties, which we typically receive when the fair value of our pledged collateral exceeds our current margin requirement. Though the fair value of this noncash collateral is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, we include this amount in our liquidity measure because we have the right to repledge the noncash collateral pledged to us by our counterparties. Our liquidity as of September 30, 2024 was 708.7 million, which consisted of unrestricted cash of 268.3 million, unencumbered Agency MBS with a fair value of 392.9 million, margin receivable on derivatives of 26.0 million, and noncash collateral received from our counterparties, which consisted of U.S. Treasuries and Agency RMBS, with a fair value of 21.4 million. Our liquidity as of December 31, 2023 was 453.6 million. 
 We continuously monitor our liquidity, especially with potential risk events on the horizon, such as uncertainty regarding Federal Reserve policy decisions, the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet, quantitative tightening or easing measures, frequent potential for a government shutdown, and the impact on global markets stemming from global central bank policies. We are also monitoring the wars between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas, and the broadening of conflict across the Middle East. We continuously assess the adequacy of our liquidity under various scenarios based on changes in the fair value of our investments and derivative instruments due to market factors such as changes in the absolute level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, credit spreads, lender haircuts, and prepayment speeds, which in turn have an impact on derivative margin requirements. In performing these analyses, we will also consider the current state of the fixed income markets and the repurchase agreement markets in order to determine if market forces such as supply-demand imbalances or structural changes to these markets could change the liquidity of MBS or the availability of financing. We also communicate frequently with our counterparties. We have not experienced any material changes in the terms of our repurchase agreements with our counterparties, and they have not indicated to us any concerns regarding access to liquidity. 
 Our perception of the liquidity of our investments and market conditions significantly influences our targeted leverage. In general, our leverage will increase if we view the risk-reward opportunity of higher leverage on our capital outweighs the risk to our liquidity and book value. Our leverage, which we calculate using total liabilities plus the cost basis of TBA long positions, was 7.6 times shareholders equity as of September 30, 2024. We include the cost basis of our TBA securities in evaluating our leverage because it is possible under certain market conditions that it may be uneconomical for us to roll a TBA long position into future months, which may result in us having to take physical delivery of the underlying securities and use cash or other financing sources to fund our total purchase commitment. Leverage based on repurchase agreement amounts outstanding was 5.6 times shareholders equity as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our repurchase agreement borrowings are uncommitted with terms renewable at the discretion of our lenders and generally have original terms to maturity of overnight to six months, though in some instances we may enter into longer-dated maturities depending on market conditions. We seek to maintain unused capacity under our existing repurchase agreement credit lines with multiple counterparties, which helps protect us in the event of a counterparty's failure to renew existing repurchase agreements. As part of our continuous evaluation of counterparty risk, we maintain our highest counterparty exposures with broker dealer subsidiaries of regulated financial institutions or primary dealers. 
 The amount outstanding for our repurchase agreement borrowings will typically fluctuate in any given period as it is dependent upon a number of factors, but particularly the extent to which we are active in buying and selling securities, including the volume of activity in TBA dollar roll transactions versus buying specified pools. The following table presents information regarding the balances of our repurchase agreement borrowings as of and for the periods indicated: 
 Repurchase Agreements s in thousands) Balance Outstanding As of Quarter End Average Balance Outstanding For the Quarter Ended Maximum Balance Outstanding During the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 6,423,890 5,943,805 6,461,475 June 30, 2024 5,494,428 5,410,282 5,529,856 March 31, 2024 5,284,708 5,365,575 5,469,434 December 31, 2023 5,381,104 5,168,821 5,381,354 September 30, 2023 5,002,230 4,773,435 5,037,440 June 30, 2023 4,201,901 3,447,406 4,203,788 March 31, 2023 2,937,124 2,713,481 2,959,263 December 31, 2022 2,644,405 2,727,274 3,072,483 September 30, 2022 2,991,876 2,398,268 3,082,138 
 
 For our repurchase agreement borrowings, we are required to post and maintain margin to the lender (i.e., collateral in excess of the repurchase agreement borrowing) in order to support the amount of the financing. This excess collateral is often referred to as a haircut and is intended to provide the lender protection against fluctuations in fair value of the collateral and/or the failure by us to repay the borrowing at maturity. Lenders have the right to change haircut requirements at maturity of the repurchase agreement and may change their haircuts based on market conditions and the perceived riskiness of the collateral pledged. If the fair value of the collateral falls below the amount required by the lender, the lender has the right to demand additional margin, or collateral. These demands are referred to as margin calls, and if we fail to meet any margin call, our lenders have the right to terminate the repurchase agreement and sell any collateral pledged. The weighted average haircut for our borrowings as of September 30, 2024 was consistent with prior periods, which has typically averaged less than 5 for borrowings collateralized with Agency RMBS and CMBS and between 10-14 for borrowings collateralized with CMBS IO. 
 The collateral we post in excess of our repurchase agreement borrowing with any counterparty is also typically referred to by us as equity at risk, which represents the potential loss to the Company if the counterparty is unable or unwilling to return collateral securing the repurchase agreement borrowing at its maturity. The counterparties with whom we have the greatest amounts of equity at risk may vary significantly during any given period due to the short-term and generally uncommitted nature of the repurchase agreement borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, we had amounts outstanding under 28 different repurchase agreements and did not have more than 10 of equity at risk with any counterparty or group of related counterparties. 
 We have various financial and operating covenants in certain of our repurchase agreements, which we monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis for compliance as well as for impacts these customary covenants may have on our operating and financing flexibility. Currently, we do not believe we are subject to any covenants that materially restrict our financing flexibility. We were in full compliance with our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024, and we are not aware of circumstances which could potentially result in our non-compliance in the foreseeable future. 
 
 Derivative Instruments 
 Derivative instruments we enter into may require us to post initial margin at inception and daily variation margin based on subsequent changes in their fair value. Daily variation margin requirements also entitle us to receive collateral from our counterparties if the value of amounts owed to us under the derivative agreement exceeds 
 the minimum margin requirement. The collateral posted as margin by us is typically in the form of cash. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash collateral posted to our counterparties of 137.3 million under these agreements. 
 Collateral requirements for interest rate derivative instruments are typically governed by the central clearing exchange and the associated futures commission merchant, which may establish margin requirements in excess of the clearing exchange. Collateral requirements for our TBA contracts are governed by the Mortgage-Backed Securities Division ("MBSD") of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and, if applicable, by our third-party brokerage agreements, which may establish margin levels in excess of the MBSD. Our TBA contracts, which are subject to master securities forward transaction agreements published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association as well as supplemental terms and conditions with each counterparty, generally provide that valuations for our TBA contracts and any pledged collateral are to be obtained from a generally recognized source agreed to by both parties. However, in certain circumstances, our counterparties have the sole discretion to determine the value of the TBA contract and any pledged collateral. In such instances, our counterparties are required to act in good faith in making determinations of value. In the event of a margin call, we must generally provide additional collateral on the same business day. 
 Dividends 
 As a REIT, we are required to distribute to our shareholders amounts equal to at least 90 of our REIT taxable income for each taxable year after certain deductions. When declaring dividends, our Board of Directors considers the Company s taxable income, the REIT distribution requirements of the Tax Code, financial performance measures, and maintaining compliance with dividend requirements of the Series C Preferred Stock, along with other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. 
 We designate the majority of our derivative instruments as interest rate hedges for tax purposes. Realized gains (losses) resulting from the difference in fair value and the amount of cash received or paid upon termination or maturity of derivative instruments are included in GAAP earnings in the same reporting period in which the derivative instrument matures or is terminated by the Company but are generally not recognized in REIT taxable income until future periods. The following table provides the projected amortization of our net deferred tax hedge gains as of September 30, 2024 that will be recognized as taxable income over the periods indicated, though recognition of deferred tax hedge gains and losses may be accelerated if the underlying instrument originally hedged is terminated or paid off: 
 Period of Recognition for Remaining Hedge Gains, Net September 30, 2024 in thousands) Fourth quarter 2024 
 21,981 Fiscal year 2025 
 88,583 Fiscal year 2026 and thereafter 
 514,845 625,409 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we also had 583.6 million in capital loss carryforwards, the majority of which expire before 2028, and NOL carryforwards of 8.1 million, of which 4.6 million will expire on December 31, 2024 and the remainder in 2025. Due to these amounts and other temporary and permanent differences between GAAP net income and REIT taxable income coupled with the degree of uncertainty about the trajectory of interest rates, we cannot reasonably estimate how much the deferred tax hedge gains to be recognized will impact our dividend declarations during 2024 or in any given year. 
 We generally fund dividend distributions through portfolio cash flows. If we make dividend distributions in excess of our portfolio cash flows during the period, whether for purposes of meeting our REIT distribution requirements or other reasons, those distributions are generally funded either through our existing cash balances or through the return of principal from our investments (either through repayment or sale). Please refer to "Operating and Regulatory Structure" within Part I, Item 1, "Business" as well as Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K for additional important information regarding dividends declared on our taxable income. 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 Please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained within Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based in large part upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded. 
 
 Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, and which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Our critical accounting estimates are discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K under Critical Accounting Estimates. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk is the exposure to losses resulting from changes in market factors. Our business strategy exposes us to a variety of market risks, including interest rate, spread, prepayment, credit, liquidity, and reinvestment risks. These risks can and do cause fluctuations in our liquidity, comprehensive income and book value as discussed below. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Investing in interest-rate sensitive investments such as MBS and TBA securities subjects us to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk results from investing in securities that have a fixed coupon or a floating coupon that may not immediately adjust for changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk also results from the mismatch between the duration of our assets versus the duration of our liabilities and hedges. The amount of the impact will depend on the composition of our portfolio, our hedging strategy, the effectiveness of our hedging instruments as well as the magnitude and the duration of the change in interest rates. 
 We manage interest rate risk within tolerances set by our Board of Directors. We use interest rate hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates on the market value of our assets and on our interest expense from repurchase agreements used to finance our investments. Our hedging methods are based on many factors, including, but not limited to, our estimates with regard to future interest rates and expected levels of prepayments of our assets. If prepayments are slower or faster than assumed, the maturity of our investments will also differ from our expectations, which could reduce the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and may cause losses that adversely affect our cash flow. Estimates of prepayment speeds can vary significantly by investor for the same security, and therefore estimates of security and portfolio duration can vary significantly between market participants. 
 We continuously monitor market conditions, economic conditions, interest rates and other market activity and frequently adjust the composition of our investments and hedges throughout any given period. As such, the projections for changes in market value provided below are limited in usefulness because the modeling assumes no changes to the composition of our investment portfolio or hedging instruments as of the dates indicated. Changes in types of our investments, the returns earned on these investments, future interest rates, credit spreads, the shape of the yield curve, the availability of financing, and/or the mix of our investments and financings including derivative instruments may cause actual results to differ significantly from the modeled results shown in the tables below. There can be no assurance that assumed events used to model the results shown below will occur, or that other events will not occur, that will affect the outcomes; therefore, the modeled results shown in the tables below and all related disclosures constitute forward-looking statements. 
 Management considers changes in the shape of the interest rate curves in assessing and managing portfolio interest rate risk on the market value of its investments and common equity. Because interest rates do not typically move in a parallel fashion from period to period (as can be seen by the graph for U.S. Treasury rates in Item 2, Executive Overview ), the tables below show the projected sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments and the percentage change in shareholders equity assuming instantaneous parallel shifts and non-parallel shifts in market interest rates.

In bearish-rate shifts where interest rates are increasing, models project the market value of our investments, net of hedges and our common equity as of September 30, 2024, will decline versus that as December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of having a larger portfolio as of September 30, 2024 with higher coupon assets which carry more extension risk in higher interest rate scenarios. 
 
 In bullish-rate shifts where the yield curve flattens due to declining interest rates, models projected the market value of our investments, net of hedges and our common equity as of September 30, 2024 will decline less versus that as of December 31, 2023, because of the additional duration of the aggregate portfolio resulting from the assets extending. In bullish-rate shifts where the yield curve steepens due to declining interest rates, models project higher increases in market value of our investments, net of hedges and common equity due to having a larger portfolio as of September 30, 2024 versus December 31, 2023. 
 
 Spread Risk 
 Spread risk is the risk of loss from an increase in the market spread between the yield on an investment versus its benchmark index. Changes in market spreads represent the market's valuation of the perceived riskiness of an asset relative to risk-free rates. Widening spreads reduce the market value of our investments as market participants require additional yield to hold riskier assets. Market spreads could change based on macroeconomic or systemic factors as well as the factors specific to a particular security such as prepayment performance or credit performance. Other factors that could impact credit spreads include technical issues such as supply and demand for a particular type of security or Federal Reserve monetary policy. We do not hedge spread risk given the complexity of hedging credit spreads and in our opinion, the lack of liquid instruments available to use as hedges. 
 Fluctuations in spreads typically vary based on the type of investment. Sensitivity to changes in market spreads is derived from models that are dependent on various assumptions, and actual changes in market value in response to changes in market spreads could differ materially from the projected sensitivity if actual conditions differ from these assumptions. 
 The table below shows the projected sensitivity of the market value of our investments given the indicated change in market spreads as of the dates indicated:

 and non-Agency CMBS IO.

Prepayment Risk 
 Prepayment risk is the risk of an early, unscheduled return of principal on an investment. We are subject to prepayment risk from premiums paid on investments, which are amortized as a reduction in interest income using the effective interest method under GAAP. Our comprehensive income and book value per common share may also be negatively impacted by prepayments if the fair value of the investment materially exceeds the par balance of the underlying security. Principal prepayments on our investments are influenced by changes in market interest rates and a variety of economic, geographic, government policy and other factors beyond our control, including GSE policy with respect to loan forbearance and delinquent loan buy-outs. 
 We seek to manage our prepayment risk on our MBS by diversifying our investments and investing in securities which either contain loans for which the underlying borrowers have disincentive to refinance or have some provision of prepayment prohibition or yield maintenance as is the case with CMBS and CMBS IO. Loans underlying our CMBS and CMBS IO securities typically have some form of prepayment protection provisions (such as prepayment lock-outs) or prepayment compensation provisions (such as yield maintenance or prepayment penalties). Because CMBS IO consist of rights to interest on the underlying commercial mortgage loan pools and do not have rights to principal payments on the underlying loans, prepayment risk on these securities is particularly acute without these prepayment protection provisions. There are no prepayment protections if the loan defaults and is partially or wholly repaid earlier as a result of loss mitigation actions taken by the underlying loan servicer. 
 Our prepayment risk as of September 30, 2024 has declined relative to prior periods as the majority of our MBS portfolio consists of securities owned near or below par and prepayment speeds have declined in the current higher interest rate environment. However, if higher yielding investments prepay at a faster rate than anticipated, we may be unable to reinvest the repayments at comparable yields. Our net interest income may be negatively impacted if the proceeds from prepayments are reinvested into assets with lower yields. In an increasing interest rate environment, lower yielding assets with a fixed rate may extend or prepay slower than anticipated. Because we finance our investments with short-term repurchase agreement financing, we may be required to finance our investments at a higher interest rate without the ability to reinvest principal into higher yielding securities. As a result of rising financing costs, our net interest income could fall or could be negative for extended periods of time. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the risk that we will not receive all contractual amounts due on investments that we own due to default by the borrower or due to a deficiency in proceeds from the liquidation of the collateral securing the obligation. Credit losses on loans could result in lower or negative yields on our investments. 
 Agency RMBS and Agency CMBS have credit risk to the extent that Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac fails to remit payments on the MBS for which they have issued a guaranty of payment. Given the improved financial performance and conservatorship of these entities and the continued support of the U.S. government, we believe this risk is low. 
 Agency and non-Agency CMBS IO represent the right to excess interest (and not principal) on the underlying loans. These securities are exposed to the loss of investment basis in the event a loan collateralizing the security liquidates without paying yield maintenance or prepayment penalty. This will typically occur when the underlying loan is in default and proceeds from the disposition of the loan collateral are insufficient to pay the prepayment consideration. To mitigate credit risk of investing in CMBS IO, we invest in primarily AAA-rated securities that are stripped off senior tranches, which means we receive the highest payment priority and are the last to absorb losses in the event of a shortfall in cash flows. Our Agency CMBS IO are Class X1 from Freddie Mac Series K deals from which interest continues to be advanced even in the event of an underlying default up until liquidation, which is the triggering event that disrupts the Agency CMBS IO cash flow. For non-Agency CMBS IO, the servicer and master servicer will determine if interest will continue to be advanced upon default of a loan based on their estimate of liquidation proceeds. Senior non-Agency CMBS IO may benefit from changes in contractual cash flows, including modifications or loan extensions as the senior classes can remain outstanding beyond the original maturity date. 
 40 

In addition, bilateral agreements expose us to increased credit risk related to our counterparties, and we may be at risk of loss of any collateral held by a repurchase or derivative counterparty if the counterparty becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 We have liquidity risk principally from the use of recourse repurchase agreements to finance our ownership of securities. Our repurchase agreements are renewable at the discretion of our lenders and do not contain guaranteed roll-over terms. If we fail to repay the lender at maturity, the lender has the right to immediately sell the collateral and pursue us for any shortfall if the sales proceeds are inadequate to cover the repurchase agreement financing. In addition, declines in the market value of our investments pledged as collateral for repurchase agreement borrowings and for our derivative instruments may result in counterparties initiating margin calls for additional collateral. 
 Our use of TBA long positions as a means of investing in and financing Agency RMBS also exposes us to liquidity risk in the event that we are unable to roll or terminate our TBA contracts prior to their settlement date. If we are unable to roll or terminate our TBA long positions, we could be required to take physical delivery of the underlying securities and settle our obligations for cash, which could negatively impact our liquidity position or force us to sell assets under adverse conditions if financing is not available to us on acceptable terms. 
 For further information, including how we attempt to mitigate liquidity risk and monitor our liquidity position, and in particular, during the current macroeconomic environment, please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as within Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Reinvestment Risk 
 We are subject to reinvestment risk as a result of the prepayment, repayment and sales of our investments. In order to maintain our investment portfolio size and our earnings, we need to reinvest capital received from these events into new interest-earning assets or TBA securities, and if market yields on new investments are lower or if financing costs are higher, our net interest income will decline. In addition, based on market conditions, our leverage, and our liquidity profile, we may decide to not reinvest the cash flows we receive from our investment portfolio even when attractive reinvestment opportunities are available, or we may decide to reinvest in assets with lower yield but greater liquidity. If we retain capital or pay dividends to return capital to shareholders rather than reinvest capital, or if we invest capital in lower yielding assets for liquidity reasons, the size of our investment portfolio and the amount of income generated by our investment portfolio will likely decline. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this report.
