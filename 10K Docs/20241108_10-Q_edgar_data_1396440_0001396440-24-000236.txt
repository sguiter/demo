period subsequent to the initial investment. In certain instances, Main Street may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in its stockholders best interest, to consult with the Financial Advisory Firm on its investments in one or more LMM portfolio companies. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where the fair value of Main Street s investment in a LMM portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to the total Investment Portfolio. Main Street consulted with and received an assurance certification from the Financial Advisory Firm in arriving at its determination of fair value for its investments in a total of LMM portfolio companies during each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, representing and of the total LMM portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A total of LMM portfolio companies were reviewed and certified by the Financial Advisory Firm during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024, representing of the total LMM portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2024. Excluding its investments in LMM portfolio companies that, as of September 30, 2024, had not been in the Investment Portfolio for at least twelve months subsequent to the initial investment or whose primary purpose is to own real estate for which a third-party appraisal is obtained on at least an annual basis, of the LMM portfolio at fair value was reviewed and certified by the Financial Advisory Firm during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For valuation purposes, all of Main Street s Private Loan portfolio investments are non-control investments. For Private Loan portfolio investments for which it has determined that third-party quotes or other independent pricing are not available or appropriate, Main Street generally estimates the fair value based on the assumptions that it believes hypothetical market participants would use to value such Private Loan debt investments in a current hypothetical sale using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method and such Private Loan equity investments in a current hypothetical sale using the Waterfall valuation method. 
 In addition to its internal valuation process, in arriving at estimates of fair value for its investments in its Private Loan portfolio companies, Main Street, among other things, consults with the Financial Advisory Firm. The Financial Advisory Firm analyzes and provides observations and recommendations and an assurance certification regarding Main Street s determinations of the fair value of its Private Loan portfolio company investments. The Financial Advisory Firm is generally consulted relative to Main Street s investments in each Private Loan portfolio company at least once every calendar year, and for Main Street s investments in new Private Loan portfolio companies, at least once in the period subsequent to the initial investment. In certain instances, Main Street may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in its stockholders best interest, to consult with the Financial Advisory Firm on its investments in one or more Private Loan portfolio companies. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where the fair value of Main Street s investment in a Private Loan portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to the total Investment Portfolio. Main Street consulted with and received an assurance certification from the Financial Advisory Firm in arriving at its determination of fair value for its investments in a total of and Private Loan portfolio companies during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing and of the total Private Loan portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A total of Private Loan portfolio companies were reviewed and certified by the Financial Advisory Firm during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024, representing of the total Private Loan portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2024. Excluding its investments in Private Loan portfolio companies that, as of September 30, 2024, had not been in the Investment Portfolio for at least twelve months subsequent to the initial investment and its investments in Private Loan portfolio companies that were not reviewed because the investment is valued based upon third-party quotes or other independent pricing, of the Private Loan portfolio at fair value was reviewed and certified by the Financial Advisory Firm during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For valuation purposes, all of Main Street s Middle Market portfolio investments are non-control investments. To the extent sufficient observable inputs are available to determine fair value, Main Street uses observable inputs to determine the fair value of these investments through obtaining third-party quotes or other independent pricing. For Middle Market portfolio investments for which it has determined that third-party quotes or other independent pricing are not available or appropriate, Main Street generally estimates the fair value based on the assumptions that it believes hypothetical market participants would use to value such Middle Market debt investments in a current hypothetical sale using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method and such Middle Market equity investments in a current hypothetical sale

and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) of the Middle Market portfolio investments (i) are valued using third-party quotes or other independent pricing services or (ii) Main Street has consulted with and received an assurance certification from the Financial Advisory Firm within the last twelve months. 
 For valuation purposes, Main Street s short-term portfolio investments have historically been comprised of non-control investments. To the extent sufficient observable inputs are available to determine fair value, Main Street uses observable inputs to determine the fair value of these investments through obtaining third-party quotes or other independent pricing. Because any short-term portfolio investments are typically valued using third-party quotes or other independent pricing services, Main Street generally does not consult with any financial advisory services firms in connection with determining the fair value of its short-term portfolio investments. 
 For valuation purposes, all of Main Street s Other Portfolio investments are non-control investments. Main Street s Other Portfolio investments comprised of Main Street s Investment Portfolio at fair value as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Similar to the LMM investment portfolio, market quotations for Other Portfolio equity investments are generally not readily available. For its Other Portfolio equity investments, Main Street generally determines the fair value of these investments using the NAV valuation method. 
 For valuation purposes, Main Street s investment in the External Investment Manager is a control investment. Market quotations are not readily available for this investment, and as a result, Main Street determines the fair value of the External Investment Manager using the Waterfall valuation method under the market approach. In estimating the enterprise value, Main Street analyzes various factors, including the entity s historical and projected financial results, as well as its size, marketability and performance relative to the population of market comparables, and the valuations for comparable publicly traded companies and private transactions involving comparable companies. This valuation approach estimates the value of the investment as if Main Street were to sell, or exit, the investment. In addition, Main Street considers its ability to control the capital structure of the company, as well as the timing of a potential exit, in connection with determining the fair value of the External Investment Manager. Main Street consults with and receives an assurance certification from the Financial Advisory Firm in arriving at its determination of fair value for its investment in the External Investment Adviser on a quarterly basis, including as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, Main Street s determination of fair value for its Investment Portfolio may differ materially from the values that would have been determined had a ready market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. Main Street determines the fair value of each individual investment and records changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. 
 Main Street uses an internally developed portfolio investment rating system in connection with its investment oversight, portfolio management and analysis and investment valuation procedures for its LMM, Private Loan and Middle Market portfolio companies. This system takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors of each LMM, Private Loan and Middle Market portfolio company. 
 Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act permits a BDC s board of directors to designate its executive officers or investment adviser as a valuation designee to determine the fair value for its investment portfolio, subject to the active oversight of the board. Main Street s Board of Directors has approved policies and procedures pursuant to Rule 2a-5 (the Valuation Procedures and has designated a group of its executive officers to serve as the Board of Directors valuation designee. Main Street believes its Investment Portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximates fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which it operates and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.

 Investment Portfolio Composition 
 Main Street s principal investment objective is to maximize its portfolio s total return by generating current income from its debt investments and current income and capital appreciation from its equity and equity-related investments, including warrants, convertible securities and other rights to acquire equity securities in a portfolio company. Main Street seeks to achieve its investment objective primarily through its LMM and Private Loan investment strategies. 
 Main Street s LMM investment strategy is focused on investments in secured debt and equity in privately held, LMM companies based in the United States. Main Street s LMM portfolio companies generally have annual revenues between million and million, and its LMM investments generally range in size from million to million. The LMM debt investments are typically secured by a first priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company, can include either fixed or floating interest rate terms and generally have a term of between five and from the original investment date. Main Street typically makes direct equity investments and/or receives nominally priced equity warrants in connection with a debt investment. 
 Main Street s Private Loan investment strategy is focused on investments in secured debt in privately held companies that generally have annual revenues between million and million, and its Private Loan investments generally range in size from million to million. Main Street s Private Loan investments primarily consist of debt securities that have primarily been originated directly by Main Street or, to a lesser extent, through its strategic relationships with other investment funds on a collaborative basis through investments that are often referred to in the debt markets as club deals because of the small lender group size. In both cases, our Private Loan investments are typically made in a company owned by or in the process of being acquired by a private equity fund. Main Street s Private Loan portfolio debt investments are generally secured by a first priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically

from the original investment date. Main Street may have the option to co-invest with the private equity fund in the equity securities of its Private Loan portfolio companies. 
 Main Street also maintains a legacy portfolio of investments in larger middle market Middle Market companies (its Middle Market investment portfolio ). Main Street s Middle Market investments are generally debt investments in companies owned by a private equity fund that were originally issued through a syndication financing process. Main Street has generally stopped making new Middle Market investments and expects its Middle Market investment portfolio to continue to decline in future periods as its existing Middle Market investments are repaid or sold. Main Street s Middle Market debt investments generally range in size from million to million, are generally secured by a first priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have an expected duration of between three and from the original investment date. 
 Main Street s other portfolio Other Portfolio investments primarily consist of investments that are not consistent with the typical profiles for its LMM, Private Loan or Middle Market portfolio investments, including investments which may be managed by third parties. In the Other Portfolio, Main Street may incur indirect fees and expenses in connection with investments managed by third parties, such as investments in other investment companies or private funds. For Other Portfolio investments, Main Street generally receives distributions related to the assets held by the portfolio company. Those assets are typically expected to be liquidated over a five to period. 
 Based upon Main Street s liquidity and capital structure management activities, Main Street s Investment Portfolio may also periodically include short-term portfolio investments that are atypical of Main Street s LMM, Private Loan and Middle Market portfolio investments in that they are intended to be a short-term deployment of capital. Those assets are typically expected to be liquidated in or less. These short-term portfolio investments are not expected to be a significant portion of the overall Investment Portfolio. 
 Main Street s external asset management business is conducted through its External Investment Manager. The External Investment Manager earns management fees based on the assets under management for External Parties and may earn incentive fees, or a carried interest, based on the performance of the assets managed. Main Street entered into an agreement with the External Investment Manager to share employees in connection with its asset management business generally, and specifically for its relationship with MSC Income Fund, Inc. MSC Income and its other clients. Through this agreement, Main Street shares employees with the External Investment Manager, including their related infrastructure, business relationships, management expertise and capital raising capabilities. Main Street allocates the related expenses to the External Investment Manager pursuant to the sharing agreement. Main Street s total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are net of expenses allocated to the External Investment Manager of million and million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of million and million, respectively. 
 Investment income, consisting of interest, dividends and fees, can fluctuate dramatically due to various factors, including the level of new investment activity, repayments of debt investments or sales of equity interests. Investment income in any given year could also be highly concentrated among several portfolio companies. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Main Street did not record investment income from any single portfolio company in excess of 10 of total investment income.

The weighted-average annual effective yield on Main Street s debt portfolio as of September 30, 2024 including debt investments on non-accrual status was for its LMM portfolio, for its Private Loan portfolio and for its Middle Market portfolio.

Main Street s portfolio investments are typically made to support management buyouts, recapitalizations, growth financings, refinancings and acquisitions of companies that operate in diverse industry sectors. Main Street seeks to partner with entrepreneurs, business owners and management teams and generally provides one-stop debt and equity financing solutions within its LMM investment strategy.

 MSCC was formed in March 2007 to operate as an internally managed business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). Because MSCC is internally managed, all of the executive officers and other employees are employed by MSCC. Therefore, MSCC does not pay any external investment advisory fees, but instead directly incurs the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals. 
 MSCC wholly owns several investment funds, including Main Street Mezzanine Fund, LP MSMF and Main Street Capital III, LP MSC III and, together with MSMF, the Funds ), and each of their general partners. The Funds are each licensed as a Small Business Investment Company SBIC by the United States Small Business Administration SBA ).

Exchange Commission SEC to allow the External Investment Manager to register as a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Since the External Investment Manager conducts all of its investment management activities for External Parties, it is accounted for as a portfolio investment of Main Street and is not included as a consolidated subsidiary in Main Street s consolidated financial statements. 
 MSCC has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). As a result, MSCC generally does not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary taxable income or capital gains that it distributes to its stockholders. 
 MSCC has certain direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries that have elected to be taxable entities (the Taxable Subsidiaries ). The primary purpose of the Taxable Subsidiaries is to permit MSCC to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are pass-through entities for tax purposes. MSCC also has certain direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries formed for financing purposes (the Structured Subsidiaries ). 
 Unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise indicates, the terms we, us, our, the Company and Main Street refer to MSCC and its consolidated subsidiaries, which include the Funds, the Taxable Subsidiaries and the Structured Subsidiaries.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO SUMMARY 
 The following tables provide a summary of our investments in the LMM, Private Loan and Middle Market portfolios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (this information excludes Other Portfolio investments and the External Investment Manager which are discussed further below). 
 As of September 30, 2024 
 LMM (a) Private Loan Middle Market (dollars in millions) Number of portfolio companies 84 92 17 Fair value 2,468.8 1,883.3 178.2 Cost 1,924.5 1,937.7 218.3 Debt investments as a of portfolio (at cost) 72.2 95.9 88.0 Equity investments as a of portfolio (at cost) 27.8 4.1 12.0 of debt investments at cost secured by first priority lien 99.2 99.9 97.6 Weighted-average annual effective yield (b) 13.0 12.4 12.6 Average EBITDA (c) 9.6 35.0 53.1 ____________________ 
 (a) As of September 30, 2024, we had equity ownership in all of our LMM portfolio companies, and the average fully diluted equity ownership in those portfolio companies was 39 . 
 (b) The weighted-average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments at cost as of September 30, 2024, including amortization of deferred debt origination fees and accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments and any debt investments on non-accrual status. The weighted-average annual effective yield on our debt portfolio as of September 30, 2024 including debt investments on non-accrual status was 12.3 for our LMM portfolio, 12.0 for our Private Loan portfolio and 10.6 for our Middle Market portfolio. The weighted-average annual effective yield is not reflective of what an investor in shares of our common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect changes in the market value of our stock, our utilization of debt capital in our capital structure, our expenses or any sales load paid by an investor. 
 (c) The average EBITDA is calculated using a simple average for the LMM portfolio and a weighted-average for the Private Loan and Middle Market portfolios. These calculations exclude certain portfolio companies, including four LMM portfolio companies, five Private Loan portfolio companies and two Middle Market portfolio companies, as EBITDA is not a meaningful valuation metric for our investments in these portfolio companies, and those portfolio companies whose primary purpose is to own real estate and those portfolio companies whose primary operations have ceased and only residual value remains. 
 As of December 31, 2023 
 LMM (a) Private Loan Middle Market (dollars in millions) Number of portfolio companies 80 87 23 Fair value 2,273.0 1,453.5 243.7 Cost 1,782.9 1,470.1 294.4 Debt investments as a of portfolio (at cost) 72.0 94.7 91.4 Equity investments as a of portfolio (at cost) 28.0 5.3 8.6 of debt investments at cost secured by first priority lien 99.2 100.0 99.1 Weighted-average annual effective yield (b) 13.0 12.9 12.5 Average EBITDA (c) 8.2 27.2 64.2 ____________________

issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments and any debt investments on non-accrual status. The weighted-average annual effective yield on our debt portfolio as of December 31, 2023 including debt investments on non-accrual status was 12.9 for our LMM portfolio, 12.5 for our Private Loan portfolio and 10.8 for our Middle Market portfolio. The weighted-average annual effective yield is not reflective of what an investor in shares of our common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect changes in the market value of our stock, our utilization of debt capital in our capital structure, our expenses or any sales load paid by an investor. 
 (c) The average EBITDA is calculated using a simple average for the LMM portfolio and a weighted-average for the Private Loan and Middle Market portfolios. These calculations exclude certain portfolio companies, including two LMM portfolio companies and two Private Loan portfolio companies, as EBITDA is not a meaningful valuation metric for our investments in these portfolio companies, and those portfolio companies whose primary purpose is to own real estate. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we achieved an annualized total return on investments of 17.7 and 16.0 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we achieved an annualized total return on investments of 16.7 and 15.4 , respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we achieved a total return on investments of 16.3 . Total return on investments is calculated using the interest, dividend and fee income, as well as the realized and unrealized change in fair value of the Investment Portfolio for the specified period. Our total return on investments is not reflective of what an investor in shares of our common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect changes in the market value of our stock, our utilization of debt capital in our capital structure, our expenses or any sales load paid by an investor. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had Other Portfolio investments in 14 entities, collectively totaling 162.4 million in fair value and 155.8 million in cost basis and which comprised 3.3 and 3.7 of our Investment Portfolio at fair value and cost, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had Other Portfolio investments in 15 entities, collectively totaling 142.0 million in fair value and 149.1 million in cost basis and which comprised 3.3 and 4.0 of our Investment Portfolio at fair value and cost, respectively. 
 As previously discussed, the External Investment Manager is a wholly-owned subsidiary that is treated as a portfolio investment. As of September 30, 2024, this investment had a fair value of 218.4 million and a cost basis of 29.5 million, which comprised 4.4 and 0.7 of our Investment Portfolio at fair value and cost, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, this investment had a fair value of 174.1 million and a cost basis of 29.5 million, which comprised 4.1 and 0.8 of our Investment Portfolio at fair value and cost, respectively. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on our current and future financial condition and results of operations. 
 Management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting policy and estimate with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our critical accounting policies and estimates include the Investment Portfolio Valuation and Revenue Recognition policies described below. Our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note B Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Investment Portfolio Valuation 
 The most significant determination inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of our Investment Portfolio and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation. We consider this determination to be a critical accounting estimate, given the significant judgments and subjective measurements required. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our Investment Portfolio valued at fair value represented 96 of our total assets. We are required to report our investments at fair value. We follow the provisions of FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances 
 133 

Table of contents 

disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is to be sold in the principal market to independent market participants, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal market that are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact. See Note B.1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Valuation of the Investment Portfolio included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a detailed discussion of our Investment Portfolio valuation process and procedures. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, our determination of fair value for our Investment Portfolio may differ materially from the values that would have been determined had a ready market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. 
 Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act permits a BDC s board of directors to designate its executive officers or investment adviser as a valuation designee to determine the fair value for its investment portfolio, subject to the active oversight of the board. Our Board of Directors has approved policies and procedures pursuant to Rule 2a-5 (the Valuation Procedures and has designated a group of our executive officers to serve as the Board of Directors valuation designee. We believe our Investment Portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximates fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Interest and Dividend Income 
 We record interest and dividend income on the accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded as dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. We evaluate accrued interest and dividend income periodically for collectability. When a loan or debt security becomes 90 days or more past due, and if we otherwise do not expect the debtor to be able to service its debt obligation, we will generally place the loan or debt security on non-accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. If a loan or debt security s status significantly improves regarding the debtor s ability to service the debt obligation, or if a loan or debt security is sold or written off, we remove it from non-accrual status. 
 Fee Income 
 We may periodically provide services, including structuring and advisory services to our portfolio companies or other third parties. For services that are separately identifiable and evidence exists to substantiate fair value, fee income is recognized as earned, which is generally when the investment or other applicable transaction closes. Fees received in connection with debt financing transactions for services that do not meet these criteria are treated as debt origination fees and are generally deferred and accreted into income over the life of the financing. 
 Payment-in-Kind PIK Interest and Cumulative Dividends 
 We hold certain debt and preferred equity instruments in our Investment Portfolio that contain PIK interest and cumulative dividend provisions. The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the debt and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. Cumulative dividends are recorded as dividend income, and any dividends in arrears are added to the balance of the preferred equity investment. The actual collection of these dividends in arrears may be deferred until such time as the preferred equity is redeemed or sold. To maintain RIC tax treatment (as discussed in Note B.10. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Income Taxes included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), these non-cash sources of income may need to be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions, even though we may not have collected the PIK interest and cumulative dividends in cash. We stop accruing PIK interest and cumulative dividends and write off any accrued and uncollected interest and dividends in arrears when we determine that such PIK interest and dividends in arrears are no longer collectible. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, (i) 4.4 and 1.9 , respectively, of our total investment income was attributable to PIK interest income not paid currently in cash and (ii) 0.5 and 0.3 , respectively, of our total investment income was attributable to cumulative dividend income not paid currently in cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, (i) 3.8 and 2.0 , respectively, of our total investment income was 
 134

attributable to PIK interest income not paid currently in cash and (ii) 0.4 and 0.3 , respectively, of our total investment income was attributable to cumulative dividend income not paid currently in cash. 
 
 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION 
 The following tables summarize the composition of our total combined LMM, Private Loan and Middle Market portfolio investments at cost and fair value by type of investment as a percentage of the total combined LMM, Private Loan and Middle Market portfolio investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (this information excludes Other Portfolio investments and the External Investment Manager). 
 Cost: September 30, 2024 
 December 31, 2023 
 First lien debt 83.9 82.7 Equity 15.4 16.8 Second lien debt 0.2 0.1 Equity warrants 0.3 0.2 Other 0.2 0.2 100.0 100.0

 Our LMM, Private Loan and Middle Market portfolio investments carry a number of risks including: (1) investing in companies which may have limited operating histories and financial resources; (2) holding investments that generally are not publicly traded and which may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale; and (3) other risks common to investing in below investment-grade debt and equity investments in our Investment Portfolio. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to our Investments contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a more complete discussion of the risks involved with investing in our Investment Portfolio. 
 
 PORTFOLIO ASSET QUALITY 
 We utilize an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance of each LMM, Private Loan and Middle Market portfolio company and to monitor our expected level of returns on each of our LMM, Private Loan and Middle Market investments in relation to our expectations for the portfolio company. The investment rating system takes into consideration various factors, including, but not limited to, each investment s expected level of returns, the collectability of our debt investments and the ability to receive a return of the invested capital in our equity investments, comparisons to competitors and other industry participants, the portfolio company s future outlook and other factors that are deemed to be significant to the portfolio company. 
 As of September 30, 2024, investments on non-accrual status comprised 1.4 of our total Investment Portfolio at fair value and 3.9 at cost. As of December 31, 2023, investments on non-accrual status comprised 0.6 of our total Investment Portfolio at fair value and 2.3 at cost. 
 The operating results of our portfolio companies are impacted by changes in the broader fundamentals of the United States economy. In periods during which the United States economy contracts, it is likely that the financial results of small to mid-sized companies, like those in which we invest, could experience deterioration or limited growth from current levels, which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements, to an increase in defaults on our debt investments or in realized losses on our investments and to difficulty in maintaining historical dividend payment rates and unrealized appreciation on our equity investments. Consequently, we can provide no assurance that the performance of certain portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by future economic cycles or other conditions, which could also have a negative impact on our future results.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Set forth below is a comparison of the results of operations, and a reconciliation of net investment income to distributable net investment income, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 NM Net Change not meaningful 
 (a) Distributable net investment income is net investment income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding the impacts of share-based compensation expense and deferred compensation expense or benefit. We believe presenting distributable net investment income and the related per share amounts is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure for analyzing our financial performance since share-based compensation does not require settlement in cash and deferred compensation expense or benefit does not result in a net cash impact to Main Street upon settlement. However, distributable net investment income is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered as a replacement for net investment income or other earnings measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be reviewed only in connection with such U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing our financial performance. A reconciliation of net investment income in accordance with U.S. GAAP to distributable net investment income is detailed in the table above.

Investment Income 
 Total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 136.8 million, an 11 increase from the 123.2 million of total investment income for the corresponding period of 2023. The following table provides a summary of the changes in the comparable period activity. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 
 Net Change 2024 
 2023 
 Amount (dollars in thousands) Interest income 110,551 99,381 11,170 11 (a) Dividend income 23,239 21,192 2,047 10 (b) Fee income 3,034 2,664 370 14 Total investment income 136,824 123,237 13,587 11 (c) ____________________ 
 (a) The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average levels of income producing Investment Portfolio debt investments, partially offset by (i) an increase in investments on non-accrual status and (ii) a decrease in interest rates on floating rate Investment Portfolio debt investments primarily resulting from decreases in benchmark index rates. 
 (b) The increase in dividend income from Investment Portfolio equity investments was primarily due to increased dividend income from certain of our LMM portfolio companies. 
 (c) The increase in total investment income includes a net increase of 1.6 million in certain income considered less consistent or non-recurring, including (i) a 1.7 million increase in such interest income from accelerated prepayment, repricing and other activity related to certain Investment Portfolio debt investments and (ii) a 0.3 million increase in such dividend income, partially offset by a 0.4 million decrease in such fee income. 
 Expenses 
 Total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 49.2 million, a 20 increase from the 41.1 million in the corresponding period of 2023. The following table provides a summary of the changes in the comparable period activity.

 NM Net Change not meaningful 
 (a) The decrease in cash compensation expenses was primarily related to decreased incentive compensation accruals, partially offset by (i) increased base compensation rates and (ii) increased headcount to support our growing Investment Portfolio and asset management activities. 
 (b) The increase in interest expense was primarily related to (i) an increased weighted-average interest rate on our debt obligations resulting from the issuance of the March 2029 Notes and the June 2027 Notes and the repayment at 
 137 

Table of contents 

maturity of the May 2024 Notes (each as defined in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below) and (ii) an increase in average borrowings outstanding used to fund a portion of the growth of our Investment Portfolio. 
 (c) The increase in share-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to an increase in incentive based grants related to incentive compensation awards issued in April 2024. 
 Net Investment Income 
 Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 7 to 87.6 million, or 1.00 per share, compared to net investment income of 82.2 million, or 0.99 per share, in the corresponding period of 2023. The increase in net investment income was principally attributable to the increase in total investment income, partially offset by higher operating expenses, both as discussed above. The increase in net investment income per share also reflects the impact of the increase in weighted-average shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to shares issued since the beginning of the comparable period of the prior year through our (i) at-the-market program ATM Program ), (ii) dividend reinvestment plan and (iii) equity incentive plans. The increase in net investment income on a per share basis includes a 0.02 per share increase in investment income and a 0.01 per share increase in non-cash deferred compensation expenses, in both cases considered less consistent or non-recurring in nature. 
 Distributable Net Investment Income 
 Distributable net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 8 to 93.0 million, or 1.06 per share, compared with 86.2 million, or 1.04 per share, in the corresponding period of 2023. The increase in distributable net investment income was primarily due to the increased level of total investment income, partially offset by higher operating expenses, excluding the impact of share-based compensation expense and deferred compensation expense, both as discussed above. The increase in distributable net investment income per share reflects the impact of the increase in weighted-average shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as discussed above. The increase in distributable net investment income on a per share basis includes a 0.02 per share increase in investment income considered less consistent or non-recurring in nature.

 ____________________ 
 NM Net change not meaningful 
 (a) Distributable net investment income is net investment income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding the impacts of share-based compensation expense and deferred compensation expense or benefit. We believe presenting distributable net investment income and the related per share amounts is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure for analyzing our financial performance since share-based compensation does not require settlement in cash and deferred compensation expense or benefit does not result in a net cash impact to Main Street upon settlement. However, distributable net investment income is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered as a replacement for net investment income or other earnings measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be reviewed only in connection with such U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing our financial performance. A reconciliation of net investment income in accordance with U.S. GAAP to distributable net investment income is detailed in the table above.

Investment Income 
 Total investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 400.6 million, a 8 increase from the 371.1 million of total investment income for the corresponding period of 2023. The following table provides a summary of the changes in the comparable period activity.

 ____________________ 
 (a) The increase in interest income was primarily due to (i) higher average levels of income producing Investment Portfolio debt investments and (ii) an increase in interest rates on floating rate Investment Portfolio debt investments primarily resulting from increases in benchmark index rates, partially offset by an increase in investments on non-accrual status. 
 (b) The increase in dividend income from Investment Portfolio equity investments was primarily a result of (i) an increase of 1.3 million in dividend income from certain of our LMM portfolio companies and (ii) an increase of 0.8 million in dividend income from the External Investment Manager, partially offset by a decrease 0.6 million in dividend income from certain of our Private Loan portfolio companies. 
 (c) The increase in fee income was primarily related to (i) a 4.0 million increase in fees related to increased investment activity and (ii) a 3.1 million increase from refinancing and prepayment of debt investments. 
 (d) The increase in total investment income includes a net reduction of 1.7 million in certain income considered less consistent or non-recurring, including a 6.5 million decrease in such dividend income, partially offset by (i) a 3.5 million increase in such fee income and (ii) a 1.3 million increase in accelerated interest income from accelerated prepayment, repricing and other activity related to certain Investment Portfolio debt investments.

Expenses 
 Total expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 135.9 million, an 11 increase from the 122.2 million in the corresponding period of 2023. The following table provides a summary of the changes in the comparable period activity.

 ____________________ 
 (a) The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in business development activities, professional fees and technology costs. 
 (b) The increase in interest expense was primarily related to (i) an increased weighted-average interest rate on our debt obligations resulting from the issuance of the March 2029 Notes and the June 2027 Notes and the repayment at maturity of the May 2024 Notes (each as defined in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below), (ii) an increase in average borrowings outstanding used to fund a portion of the growth of our Investment Portfolio and (iii) an increased average interest rate on our floating rate multi-year revolving credit facility (the Corporate Facility and special purpose vehicle revolving credit facility (the SPV Facility and, together with the Corporate Facility, the Credit Facilities due to increases in benchmark index rates. 
 (c) The increase in share-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to an increase in incentive based grants related to incentive compensation awards issued in April 2024. 
 Net Investment Income 
 Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6 to 264.7 million, or 3.07 per share, compared to net investment income of 248.9 million, or 3.07 per share, for the corresponding period of 2023. The increase in net investment income was principally attributable to the increase in total investment income, partially offset by higher operating expenses, both as discussed above. Net investment income per share reflects these changes and the impact of the increase in weighted-average shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to shares issued through our (i) ATM Program, (ii) dividend reinvestment plan and (iii) equity incentive plans, in each case over the last twelve months. The increase in net investment income on a per share basis includes a 0.03 per share decrease in investment income and a 0.01 increase in non-cash deferred compensation expenses, in both cases considered less consistent or non-recurring in nature. 
 Distributable Net Investment Income 
 Distributable net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 7 to 279.6 million, or 3.24 per share, compared with 261.9 million, or 3.23 per share, in the corresponding period of 2023. The increase in distributable net investment income was primarily due to the increased level of total investment income, partially offset by higher operating expenses, excluding the impact of share-based compensation expense and deferred compensation expense (benefit), both as discussed above. The increase in distributable net investment income per share reflects the impact of the increase in weighted-average shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as discussed above. The increase in distributable net investment income on a per share basis includes a 0.03 per share decrease in investment income considered less consistent or non-recurring in nature.

 Income Tax Provision 
 The income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 33.7 million principally consisted of (i) a deferred tax provision of 27.5 million, which is primarily the result of the net activity relating to our portfolio investments held in our Taxable Subsidiaries, including changes in loss carryforwards, changes in net unrealized appreciation/depreciation and other temporary book-tax differences and (ii) a current tax provision of 6.2 million related to a 4.5 million provision for current U.S. federal and state income taxes and a 1.7 million provision for excise tax on our estimated undistributed taxable income.

 Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
 The net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 333.8 million, or 3.87 per share, compared with 289.4 million, or 3.57 per share, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The tables above provide a summary of the reasons for the change in net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash Flows 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we realized a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of 24.3 million, which is the net result of 232.2 million of cash used in our operating activities and 256.5 million of cash provided by our financing activities. 
 The 232.2 million of cash used in our operating activities resulted primarily from cash uses totaling 1.297 billion for the funding of new and follow-on portfolio investments, partially offset by (i) cash proceeds totaling 808.2 million from the sales and repayments of debt investments and sales and return of capital from equity investments, (ii) cash flows that we generated from the operating profits earned totaling 250.2 million, which is our distributable net investment income, excluding the non-cash effects of the accretion of unearned income, payment-in-kind interest income, cumulative dividends and the amortization expense for deferred financing costs and (iii) 13.7 million in cash proceeds related to other assets and liabilities. 
 The 256.5 million of cash provided by our financing activities principally consisted of (i) 400.0 million in cash proceeds from the issuance of the June 2027 Notes, (ii) 350.0 million in cash proceeds from the issuance of the March 2029 Notes, (iii) 113.7 million in net cash proceeds from equity offerings from our ATM Program, (iv) 100.0 million in net borrowings from our Credit Facilities and (v) 63.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of SBIC debentures, partially offset by (i) 450.0 million on the repayment of the May 2024 Notes, (ii) 238.3 million in dividends paid to our stockholders, (iii) 63.8 million in repayments of SBIC debentures, (iv) 11.5 million in debt issuance costs and (v) 7.3 million in purchases of vested stock for employee payroll tax withholdings. 
 Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 84.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and 1.250 billion of unused capacity under the Credit Facilities which we maintain to support our investment and operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, our NAV totaled 2.692 billion, or 30.57 per share. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 300.0 million outstanding and 810.0 million of undrawn commitments under our Corporate Facility, and 160.0 million outstanding and 440.0 million of undrawn commitments under our SPV Facility, both of which we estimated approximated fair value. Availability under our Credit Facilities is subject to certain leverage and borrowing base limitations, various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. For further information on our Credit Facilities, including key terms and financial covenants, refer to Note E Debt included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 In January 2021, we issued 300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.00 unsecured notes due July 14, 2026 (the July 2026 Notes ). In October 2021, we issued an additional 200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the July 2026 Notes. The outstanding aggregate principal amount of the July 2026 Notes was 500.0 million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 In June 2024, we issued 300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50 unsecured notes due June 4, 2027 (the June 2027 Notes ). In September 2024, we issued an additional 100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the June 2027 Notes at a public offering price of 102.134 resulting in a yield-to-maturity of 5.617 on such issuance. The June 2027 Notes issued in September 2024 have identical terms as, and are a part of a single series with, the June 2027 Notes issued in June 2024. The outstanding aggregate principal amount of the June 2027 Notes was 400.0 million and bear interest at a rate of 6.50 per year with a yield-to-maturity of approximately 6.34 as of September 30, 2024.

Table of contents 

In January 2024, we issued 350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.95 unsecured notes due March 1, 2029 (the March 2029 Notes ). The outstanding aggregate principal amount of the March 2029 Notes was 350.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Through the Funds, we have the ability to issue SBIC debentures guaranteed by the SBA at favorable interest rates and favorable terms and conditions. Under existing SBIC regulations, SBA-approved SBICs under common control have the ability to issue debentures guaranteed by the SBA up to a regulatory maximum amount of 350.0 million. On March 1, 2024, we repaid 63.8 million of SBIC debentures that had reached maturity, which reduced our total outstanding SBIC debentures to 286.2 million. Subsequently, on September 12, 2024, we borrowed an additional 63.8 million of SBIC debentures, which increased our total outstanding SBIC debentures to 350.0 million. Under existing SBA-approved commitments, we had 350.0 million of outstanding SBIC debentures guaranteed by the SBA as of September 30, 2024 through our wholly-owned SBICs, which bear a weighted-average annual fixed interest rate of 3.3 , paid semiannually, and mature ten years from issuance. The first maturity related to our SBIC debentures occurs in March 2027, and the weighted-average remaining duration is 5.9 years as of September 30, 2024. Debentures guaranteed by the SBA have fixed interest rates that equal prevailing 10-year Treasury Note rates plus a market spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest payable semiannually. The principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity, but may be pre-paid at any time with no prepayment penalty. We expect to maintain SBIC debentures under the SBIC program in the future, subject to periodic repayments and borrowings, in an amount up to the regulatory maximum amount for affiliated SBIC funds. 
 In December 2022, we issued 100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.84 Series A unsecured notes due December 23, 2025 (the December 2025 Notes ). In February 2023, we issued an additional 50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the December 2025 Notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.53 per year. The outstanding aggregate principal amount of the December 2025 Notes as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 150.0 million. 
 In May 2024, we repaid the entire 450.0 million principal amount of the issued and outstanding 5.20 unsecured notes (the May 2024 Notes ). 
 We maintain the ATM Program with certain selling agents through which we can sell up to 15,000,000 shares of our common stock by means of at-the-market offerings from time to time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 2,319,780 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of 49.48 per share and raised 114.8 million of gross proceeds under the ATM Program. Net proceeds were 113.3 million after commissions to the selling agents on shares sold and offering costs. As of September 30, 2024, sales transactions representing 2,463 shares had not settled and are not included in shares issued and outstanding on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheets but are included in the weighted-average shares outstanding in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the shares used to calculate the NAV per share. As of September 30, 2024, 2,993,444 shares remained available for sale under the ATM Program. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 5,149,460 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of 39.94 per share and raised 205.7 million of gross proceeds under the ATM Program. Net proceeds were 203.3 million after commissions to the selling agents on shares sold and offering costs. 
 We anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated through our ongoing operating activities, utilization of available borrowings under our Credit Facilities, and a combination of future issuances of debt and equity capital. Our primary uses of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, operating expenses, cash distributions to holders of our common stock and repayments of note and debenture obligations as they come due. 
 We periodically invest excess cash balances into marketable securities and short-term investments. The primary investment objective of marketable securities and short-term investments is to generate incremental cash returns on excess cash balances prior to utilizing those funds for investment in our LMM and Private Loan portfolio investments. Marketable securities generally consist of money market funds and certificates of deposit with financial institutions. Short-term portfolio investments consist primarily of investments in secured debt investments and independently rated debt investments. 
 If our common stock trades below our NAV per share, we will generally not be able to issue additional common stock at the market price, unless our stockholders approve such a sale and our Board of Directors makes certain determinations. We did not seek stockholder authorization to sell shares of our common stock below the then current NAV per share of our common stock at our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and have not sought such authorization since 2012, because our common stock price per share has generally traded significantly above the NAV per share of our 
 145 

Table of contents 

common stock since 2011. We would therefore need future approval from our stockholders to issue shares below the then current NAV per share. 
 In order to satisfy the Code requirements applicable to a RIC, we intend to distribute to our stockholders, after consideration and application of our ability under the Code to carry forward certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next tax year, substantially all of our taxable income. 
 In addition, as a BDC, we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio, or BDC asset coverage ratio, of total assets to total senior securities, which include borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200 (or 150 if certain requirements are met). In January 2008, we received an exemptive order from the SEC to exclude SBA-guaranteed debt securities issued by the Funds and any other wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours which operate as SBICs from the BDC asset coverage ratio which, in turn, enables us to fund more investments with debt capital. In May 2022, our stockholders also approved the application of the reduced BDC asset coverage ratio. As a result, the BDC asset coverage ratio applicable to us decreased from 200 to 150 effective May 3, 2022. As of September 30, 2024, our BDC asset coverage ratio was 244 . 
 Although we have been able to secure access to additional liquidity, including through the Credit Facilities, public and private debt issuances, leverage available through the SBIC program and equity offerings, there is no assurance that debt or equity capital will be available to us in the future on favorable terms, or at all. 
 Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards 
 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. We believe that the impact of recently issued standards and any that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. For a description of recently issued or adopted accounting standards, see Note B.14. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Inflation 
 Inflation has not historically had a significant effect on our results of operations in any of the reporting periods presented herein. However, our portfolio companies have experienced, specifically including over the last few years, as a result of recent geopolitical events, supply chain and labor issues, and may continue to experience, the increasing impacts of inflation on their operating results, including periodic escalations in their costs for labor, raw materials and third-party services and required energy consumption. These issues and challenges related to inflation are receiving significant attention from our investment teams and the management teams of our portfolio companies as we work to manage these growing challenges. Prolonged or more severe impacts of inflation to our portfolio companies could continue to affect their operating profits and, thereby, increase their borrowing costs, and as a result negatively impact their ability to service their debt obligations and/or reduce their available cash for distributions. In addition, these factors could have a negative effect on the fair value of our investments in these portfolio companies. The combined impacts therefrom in turn could negatively affect our results of operations. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments include commitments to extend credit and fund equity capital and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 350.0 million in outstanding commitments comprised of (i) 81 commitments to fund revolving loans that had not been fully drawn or term loans with additional commitments not yet funded and (ii) nine equity capital commitments that had not been fully called.

As of September 30, 2024, we had 160.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our SPV Facility, and the SPV Facility is scheduled to mature in September 2029. 
 Related Party Transactions and Agreements 
 We have entered into agreements and transactions with the External Investment Manager, MSC Income, the Private Loan Fund and the Private Loan Fund II, whereby we have made debt and equity investments and receive certain fees, expense reimbursements and investment income. See Note D External Investment Manager and Note L Related Party Transactions included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding these related party transactions and agreements. 
 
 In addition, we have a deferred compensation plan, whereby non-employee directors and certain key employees may defer receipt of some or all of their cash compensation and directors fees, subject to certain limitations. See Note L Related Party Transactions included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the deferred compensation plan. 
 Recent Developments 
 In November 2024, we declared a supplemental dividend of 0.30 per share payable in December 2024. This supplemental dividend is in addition to the previously announced regular monthly dividends that we declared of 0.245 per share for each of October, November and December 2024 or total regular monthly dividends of 0.735 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In November 2024, we also declared regular monthly dividends of 0.25 per share for each of January, February and March of 2025. These regular monthly dividends equal a total of 0.75 per share for the first quarter of 2025,

representing a 4.2 increase from the regular monthly dividends paid in the first quarter of 2024. Including the regular monthly and supplemental dividends declared for the fourth quarter of 2024 and first quarter of 2025, we will have paid 43.675 per share in cumulative dividends since our October 2007 initial public offering. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, and changes in interest rates may affect both our interest expense on the debt outstanding under our Credit Facilities and our interest income from portfolio investments. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks. Our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rate indices, including SOFR and Prime rates, to the extent that any debt investments include floating interest rates. See Risk Factors Risks Related to our Business and Structure We are subject to risks associated with the interest rate environment and changes in interest rates will affect our cost of capital, net investment income and the value of our investments. and Risk Factors Risks Related to Leverage Because we borrow money, the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested in us is magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us. included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for more information regarding risks associated with our debt investments and borrowings that utilize SOFR or Prime as a reference rate. 
 The majority of our debt investments are made with either fixed interest rates or floating rates that are subject to contractual minimum interest rates for the term of the investment. As of September 30, 2024, 67 of our debt Investment Portfolio (at cost) bore interest at floating rates, 96 of which were subject to contractual minimum interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 79 of our debt obligations bore interest at fixed rates. Our interest expense will be affected by changes in the published SOFR rate in connection with our Credit Facilities; however, the interest rates on our outstanding July 2026 Notes, June 2027 Notes, March 2029 Notes, SBIC Debentures and December 2025 Notes, which collectively comprise the majority of our outstanding debt, are fixed for the life of such debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements. Due to our limited use of derivatives, we have claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act and, therefore, are not subject to registration or regulation as a pool operator under such Act. The Company expects to operate as a limited derivatives user under Rule 18f-4 under the 1940 Act. In addition, the investment management and other services provided by our External Investment Manager also involve floating rate debt investments and floating rate debt obligations, and as a result the incentive fees earned by our External Investment Manager, and the corresponding benefits to our net investment income contributions from our External Investment Manager are subject to change based upon any changes in floating benchmark index rates.

The following table shows the approximate annualized increase or decrease in the components of net investment income due to hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in our investments and borrowings, or in the investments and borrowings related to the investment management and other services provided by our External Investment Manager, in both cases as of September 30, 2024.

 (1) Main Street s total contribution from the External Investment Manager is based on the performance of assets managed by the External Investment Manager (as discussed in Note D External Investment Manager included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), and any related cost of debt obligations related to such managed assets, which may fluctuate depending on changes in interest rates. Main Street shares employees with the External Investment Manager including their related infrastructure, business relationships, management expertise and raising capital capabilities (as discussed in Note D External Investment Manager included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Main Street allocates the related expenses to the External Investment Manager pursuant to the sharing agreement, which may fluctuate depending on changes in incentive fees earned by the External Investment Manager. 
 Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of the impact of interest rate changes to our Net Investment Income as of September 30, 2024, the analysis does not take into consideration future changes in the credit market, credit quality or other business or economic developments that could affect our Net Investment Income. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above. The hypothetical results assume that all SOFR and Prime rate changes would be effective on the first day of the period. However, the contractual SOFR and Prime rate reset dates would vary throughout the period. The majority of our investments, and the investments managed by our External Investment Manager, are based on contracts which reset quarterly, while our Credit Facilities, and the debt obligations related to the assets managed by our External Investment Manager, reset monthly.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Accounting Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them of material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. Furthermore, third parties may seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, we do not expect any current matters will materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period. 
 
 Item 1A. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 186,195 shares of our common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan. These issuances were not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The aggregate value of the shares of common stock issued during the three months ended September 30, 2024, under the dividend reinvestment plan was 9.3 million. 
 Upon vesting of restricted stock awarded pursuant to our employee equity compensation plan, shares may be withheld to meet applicable tax withholding requirements. Any withheld shares are treated as common stock purchases by the Company in our consolidated financial statements as they reduce the number of shares received by employees upon vesting (see Purchase of vested stock for employee payroll tax withholding in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Net Assets for share amounts withheld).

Item 5. Other Information
