 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. We intend such forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may , will , would , should , expects , plans , anticipates , could , intends , targets , projects , contemplates , believes , estimates , predicts , potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report include, but are not limited to statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, plans for our current and future products, anticipated product launches, expectations regarding our acquisition of LimFlow S.A. and expectations regarding market penetration, the impact of macroeconomic conditions, industry and business trends, and our expectations regarding stock compensation, business strategy, plans, market growth, regulatory climate, competitive landscape and our objectives for future operations . 
 The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and are subject to other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as such risks and uncertainties may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K we file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. 
 The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have filed as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.

 The Company offers payment terms to its customers of less than three months and these terms do not include a significant financing component. The Company excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions from the measurement of the transaction price. 
 The Company offers its standard warranty to all customers. The Company does not sell any warranties on a standalone basis. The Company s warranty provides that its products are free of material defects and conform to specifications, and includes an offer to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of defective products. This assurance does not constitute a service and is not considered a separate performance obligation. The Company estimates warranty liabilities at the time of revenue recognition and records it as a charge to cost of goods sold. 
 Costs associated with product sales include commissions which are recorded in selling, general and administrative SG A expenses. The Company applies the practical expedient and recognizes commissions as an expense when incurred because the amortization period is less than one year. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s equity investments were million and were included in deposits and other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an impairment loss of million in other income (expense) within the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). There was impairment recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Significant Accounting Policies 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no changes to the Company s significant accounting policies as described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 million of additional contingent consideration if certain commercial and reimbursement milestones are achieved, as outlined under the Contingent Payments section of the share purchase agreement with LimFlow. Such payments include (i) up to million based on net revenue generated from the sale of the LimFlow System for the years 2024 through 2026 and (ii) up to million based on the achievement of certain reimbursement milestones related to the LimFlow System. 
 The acquisition-date fair value of the contingent consideration was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation which represents Level 3 measurements because they are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the Company s assumptions in measuring fair value. Estimates and assumptions used in the fair value assessment included forecasted revenues for LimFlow, revenue risk premium, revenue volatility, operational leverage ratio, counterparty credit spread, and weighted average cost of capital. The Company has determined that the range of the potential payments on such contingencies is million to million. The fair value of the contingent consideration was million as of the acquisition date. See Note 4. Fair Value Measurements for additional information. 
 Previously Held Investment 
 Prior to the acquisition, the Company held an investment in LimFlow, which represented approximately of LimFlow's outstanding equity, and was recorded at cost minus impairment. Authoritative guidance on accounting for business combinations requires that an acquirer remeasure its previously held equity investment in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value and recognize the resulting gain or loss in earnings. In connection with acquiring the remaining equity interest of LimFlow, the Company remeasured its previously held equity investment to its fair value, as of the date of acquisition, based on the fair value of total consideration transferred. Estimates and assumptions used in the remeasurement represent a Level 3 measurement because they are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the Company s assumptions in measuring the fair value. As a result of the remeasurement, the Company valued its previously held equity investment in LimFlow at million and recognized a gain of million, included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Transaction Costs 
 The transaction costs associated with the acquisition of LimFlow consisted primarily of legal and financial advisory fees of approximately million in addition to million of severance and integration related costs, which were expensed as incurred as SG A expense during the year ended December 31, 2023.

 years 
 The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible asset, the developed technology, acquired as part of the LimFlow acquisition, was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method. Under this method, an intangible asset s fair value is equal to the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of the asset. The estimated fair value was developed by discounting future net cash flows to their present value at market-based rates of return. Such assumptions included forecasted revenues, cost of sales and operating expenses, technology obsolescence, and weighted average cost of capital. The useful life of the developed technology for amortization purposes was determined by considering the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair values of the intangible asset adjusted as appropriate for entity-specific factors including competitive, economic and other factors that may limit the useful life. The developed technology asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.

 Indemnification 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and may provide for general indemnifications. The Company s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future but have not yet been made. To date, the Company has not been subject to any claims or required to defend any action related to its indemnification obligations. 
 The Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions limiting the liability of directors, and its amended and restated bylaws provide that the Company will indemnify each of its directors to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law. The Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also provide its board of directors with discretion to indemnify its officers and employees when determined appropriate by the board. In addition, the Company has entered and expects to continue to enter into agreements to indemnify its directors and executive officers. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in various claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. Management does not believe that any existing claims and proceedings, including potential losses relating to such contingencies, will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Civil Investigative Demand 
 As previously disclosed, in December 2023, the Company received a civil investigative demand CID from the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Division, in connection with an investigation under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Civil False Claims Act (the Investigation ). The CID requests information and documents primarily relating to meals and consulting service payments provided to health care professionals. The Company is cooperating with the Investigation. The Company is unable to express a view at this time regarding the likely duration, or ultimate outcome, of the Investigation or estimate the possibility of, or amount or range of, any possible financial impact. Depending on the outcome of the Investigation, there may be a material impact on the Company s business, results of operations, or financial condition.

 The effective tax rate for all periods is driven by pre-tax income/(loss), business credits, equity compensation, state taxes, and the change in valuation allowance. The Company's income tax provision for interim reporting periods historically has been calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective income tax rate for the full year to ordinary income (loss) for the interim reporting period. In addition, the tax effects of certain significant or unusual items are recognized discretely in the quarter in which they occur. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company calculated the income tax provision using this methodology. 
 Beginning in 2024, many countries are implementing some or all of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Two-Pillar in response to tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the global economy. While we continue to evaluate those countries implementations, we do not expect those implementations to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in 2024.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Please also see the section titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements herein. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Patients first. No small plans. Take care of each other. These are the guiding principles that form the ethos of Inari Medical. We are committed to improving lives in extraordinary ways by creating innovative solutions for both unmet and underserved health needs. In addition to our purpose-built solutions, we leverage our capabilities in education, clinical research, and program development to improve patient outcomes. We are passionate about our mission to establish our treatments as the standard of care for venous disease, including venous thromboembolism VTE ), and four other disease states. We are just getting started. 
 We purpose build a variety of medical products, including minimally invasive, novel, catheter-based mechanical thrombectomy devices and their accessories to address the unique characteristics of specific disease states. In addition, in November 2023, we acquired LimFlow, a medical device company focused on limb salvage for patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia CLTI ). CLTI is an advanced stage of peripheral artery disease that is associated with increased mortality, risk of amputation and impaired quality of life. The LimFlow system utilizes transcatheter arterialization of deep veins to bypass blocked arteries in the leg and deliver oxygenated blood back into the foot via the veins in CLTI patients. The results of operations of LimFlow have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. 
 We launched VenaCore in June 2024, which is a multi-purpose device for the treatment of acute and chronic deep vein thrombosis DVT ). Together, our devices and systems provide solutions to address the following disease states: DVT, pulmonary embolism, chronic venous disease, CLTI, acute limb ischemia and dialysis access management. 
 We believe our mission-focused and highly-trained commercial organization provides a significant competitive advantage. Our most important relationships are between our sales representatives and our treating physicians, which include interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons. We recruit sales representatives who have substantial and applicable medical device and/or sales experience. Our front-line sales representatives typically attend procedures, which puts us at the intersection of the patients and physicians. We have developed systems and processes to harness the information gained from these relationships and we leverage this information to rapidly iterate our solutions, introduce and execute physician education and training programs and scale our sales organization. We market and sell our solutions to hospitals, which are reimbursed by various third-party payors. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of 111.6 million, no long-term debt outstanding and an accumulated deficit of 122.4 million. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 153.4 million in revenues with a gross margin of 87.1 and net loss of 18.4 million, as compared to revenues of 126.4 million with a gross margin of 88.5 and net income of 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 442.4 million in revenues with a gross margin of 86.7 and net loss of 73.9 million, as compared to revenues of 361.5 million with a gross margin of 88.4 and net income of 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Revenue 
 We derived substantially all our revenue from the sale of our VTE and Emerging Therapy products directly to hospitals. Our customers typically purchase our products through an initial stocking order, and then reorder replenishment inventory as procedures are performed. No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We expect our revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our offerings, grow the sales organization and sales territories, continue to grow internationally, add customers, expand the base of physicians who gain experience with using our products, expand awareness of our products with new and existing customers and as physicians perform more procedures using our products. 
 We disaggregate revenue between VTE and Emerging Therapies markets. VTE comprises revenue from the sale of our solutions addressing DVT and pulmonary embolism. Emerging Therapies comprises revenue from the sale of our solutions addressing chronic venous disease, CLTI, acute limb ischemia and dialysis access management. Revenue from VTE and Emerging Therapies were as follows (in thousands):

The increase in revenue was primarily due to an expansion of our sales territories, opening of new accounts, increase in adoption of our procedures, global commercial expansion, and introduction of new products. 
 Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold increased 5.4 million, or 37.1 , to 19.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of products sold and additional manufacturing overhead costs to support anticipated future growth. 
 Gross Margin . Gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 87.1 , compared to 88.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to product mix, the ramp up costs associated with new products, and increasing internationalization of the business.

The increase in SG A expenses was primarily due to increases of 14.3 million in personnel-related expenses, including increased commissions due to higher revenue and increased share-based compensation, 5.6 million of expenses related to professional fees, including legal expenses, 2.1 million of travel related costs, and 0.6 million in sales and marketing related expenses. 
 Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses increased by 6.6 million due to the change in fair value adjustment of our contingent consideration liability, and 2.5 million due to amortization expense related to the acquired intangible asset, offset by decrease of 2.4 million of acquisition-related expenses, which include integration, severance and retention costs, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other income (expense). Other income consists primarily of interest income, interest expense, foreign currency transaction and strategic investment gains and losses. Interest income decreased by 3.1 million to 1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower cash balances invested in short-term investments in debt securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense decreased by 0.6 million primarily due to an impairment loss related to our strategic investment recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income Taxes. Income taxes increased 3.3 million to 5.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income taxes primarily relates to an increase in expected U.S. federal and state cash taxes due to prior utilization of tax credit carryforwards and a higher annual effective tax rate applied to pretax earnings during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Gross Margin . Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 86.7 , compared to 88.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to product mix, the ramp up costs associated with new products, and increasing internationalization of the business. 
 Research and Development Expenses . R D expenses increased 16.6 million, or 25.6 , to 81.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 64.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in R D expenses was primarily due to increases of 5.9 million of personnel related expenses, 3.8 million of impairment of previously capitalized software development costs, 2.9 million of material and supplies related expenses, 1.7 million of clinical and regulatory expenses, 0.8 million of expenses related to professional fees, including legal expense, 0.7 million of software costs and depreciation expenses, and 0.6 million of travel related costs.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . SG A expenses increased 68.6 million, or 26.7 , to 325.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 256.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in SG A expenses was primarily due to increases of 47.7 million in personnel-related expenses, including increased commissions due to higher revenue and increased share-based compensation , 14.6 million of expenses related to professional fees, including legal expenses, 4.3 million in travel related expenses, 1.5 million in sales and marketing related expenses, 1.2 million of software costs and depreciation expenses, partially offset by a decrease of 0.9 million of materials and supplies related expense and 0.8 million of insurance related expenses. 
 Other Operating Expenses . Other operating expenses increased by 18.6 million due to the change in fair value adjustment of our contingent consideration liability, 7.4 million due to amortization expense related to the acquired intangible asset, and 1.5 million due to the acquisition-related expenses, which include integration, severance and retention costs, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other income (expense). Other income consists primarily of interest income, interest expense, and foreign currency transaction and strategic investment gains and losses. Interest income decreased by 9.5 million to 3.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower cash balances invested in short-term investments in debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense decreased by 0.5 million primarily due to an impairment loss related to our strategic investment recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income Taxes. Income taxes increased 19.3 million to 23.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income taxes primarily relates to an increase in expected U.S. federal and state cash taxes due to prior utilization of tax credit carryforwards and a higher annual effective tax rate applied to pretax earnings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 To date, our primary sources of capital have been the revenue from the sale of our products and existing cash and cash equivalent balances. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 41.1 million and short-term investments in debt securities of 70.4 million. We maintain cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions in excess of insured limits. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of contingent consideration related to our acquisition of LimFlow was 84.5 million, of which 39.2 million was recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 45.3 million was recorded within other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The contingent payments related to certain commercial and reimbursement milestones can be up to 165.0 million which includes (i) up to 140.0 million based on net revenue generated from the sale of the LimFlow system for the years 2024 through 2026 and (ii) up to 25.0 million based on the achievement of certain reimbursement milestones related to the LimFlow System. Revenue-based milestone payments are expected to be due in the first quarter in each of the years 2025, 2026 and 2027. The timing of reimbursement-based milestone payments is dependent on the achievement of such milestones and other conditions set forth in the share purchase agreement with LimFlow and such payments are expected to be paid in the second quarter of 2025. As of September 30, 2024, we have not made any payments related to the contingent consideration. For additional information about the acquisition, see Note 3. Business Combination , which is included in Part I, Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) .

 In December 2022, we amended our revolving Credit Agreement with Bank of America (as amended, the Previously Amended Credit Agreement which provides for loans up to a maximum of 40.0 million and increases the optional accordion to 120.0 million. The Previously Amended Credit Agreement also included a Letter of Credit subline facility (the LC Facility of up to 5.0 million. In February 2023, we amended the LC Facility to increase the limit to up to 10.0 million. In November 2023, we further amended the Amended Credit Agreement, as defined in Note 12. Credit Facility , to, among other things, increase the amount available for borrowing to up to a maximum principal amount of 75.0 million. We also amended the LC Facility to increase the limit to up to 18.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had no principal outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement and the amount available to borrow was approximately 67.9 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had four letters of credit in the aggregated amount of 2.4 million outstanding under the LC Facility. The aggregate stated amount outstanding of the letter of credits reduces the total borrowing base available under the Amended Credit Agreement and is subject to certain fees. For additional information about the Amended Credit Agreement, see Note 12. Credit Facility , which is included in Part I, Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) . 
 In October 2023, we signed a ten-year lease in Costa Rica for our second manufacturing facility with total undiscounted contractual payments of the lease of approximately 7.2 million, which are expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Our other short-term and long-term material cash requirements, from known contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024, include contingent consideration liability, operating lease liabilities and uncertain tax positions, as discussed in Note 3. Business Combination , Note 4. Fair Value Measurements , Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15. Income Taxes to our condensed consolidated financial statements section of this report, which are included in Part I, Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) of this report. 
 Based on our current planned operations, we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and available borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund these cash requirements and our operating expenses for at least the next 12 months. Our primary short-term needs for capital for our current planned operations, which are subject to change, include: 
 support of commercialization efforts to expand our sales force along with expanding into new markets, including internationally, and developing products to enhance performance and address unmet market needs; 
 the continued advancement of research and development including ongoing clinical studies and related activities, including clearance or approval of our products or product modifications; and 
 potential expansion needs of our facilities, including the lease in Costa Rica for our second manufacturing facility. 
 If our available cash balances and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements in the future, we may seek to sell additional common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into an additional credit facility or another form of third-party funding or seek other debt financing. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and, in the case of preferred equity securities or convertible debt, those securities could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings pursuant to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our platform technologies or products or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.
