segments: Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Keno Hill and Casa Berardi. Effective January 2024, we revised our internal reporting provided to our Chief Operating Decision Maker to no longer include any financial performance information for our Nevada Operations, reflecting the current status of the Nevada Operations being on care and maintenance. General corporate activities not associated with operating mines and their various exploration activities, idle properties and environmental remediation services in the Yukon, Canada, and the previously separately reported Nevada Operations are presented as Other". The presentation of the prior period information disclosed below has been revised to reflect this change.

Lucky Friday's income from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes million and million, respectively, of business interruption and property damage insurance proceeds received during the respective periods related to the fire which suspended Lucky Friday's operations from August 2023 through January 8, 2024. The insurance proceeds received are recorded as part of "Other operating (income) expense, net" in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company wrote down million of property, plant and mine development which had no salvage value. Of this amount, million is included in Lucky Friday's income from operations and is related to the remote vein miner machine for which (i) we no longer had a use following the success of the Underhand Closed Bench ("UCB") mining method, (ii) we had been unsuccessful in locating a buyer, and (iii) the vendor advised us during the period that it would discontinue support for the program. The write down is recorded as part of "Write down of Property, Plant and Mine Development" in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

The income and mining tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 varies from the amounts that would have resulted from applying the statutory tax rates to pre-tax income or loss due primarily to the impact of taxation in foreign jurisdictions, non-recognition of net operating losses and foreign exchange gains and losses in certain jurisdictions. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we used the annual effective tax rate method to calculate the tax provision. Valuation allowances on Nevada, Mexico and certain Canadian net operating losses were treated as discrete adjustments to the tax provision.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the service cost component of net periodic pension benefit is included in the same line items of our condensed consolidated financial statements as other employee compensation costs. The net benefit related to all other components of net periodic pension cost of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, is included in other income on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). During July 2024, we closed the Hecla Mining Company Retirement Plan for Employees (the Plan to new participants. The closure of the Plan does not affect employees hired prior to July 19, 2024, and they will continue to accrue benefits. Benefits to retirees will continue unchanged.

 million shares of our common stock from time to time to or through sales agents. Sales of the shares, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers transactions or as otherwise agreed between the Company and the agents as principals. Whether or not we engage in sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors, including our share price, our cash resources, customary black-out restrictions, and whether we have any material inside information. The agreement can be terminated by us at any time. Any sales of shares under the agreement are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3. Under the agreement we have sold shares for total proceeds of million, net of commissions and fees of million from September 2022 through September 30, 2024 . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold shares under the agreement for proceeds of million, net of commissions and fees of million and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we sold shares under the agreement for proceeds of million, net of commissions and fees of million. Stock-based Compensation Plans The Company has stock incentive plans for executives, directors and eligible employees, under which performance shares, restricted stock and shares of common stock are granted. Stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock unit, performance-based grants and common stock grants (collectively "incentive compensation") to employees, shares granted to the interim CEO and non-employee directors totaled million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, there was million of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of years.

In connection with the vesting of incentive compensation, employees have in the past, at their election and when permitted by us, chosen to satisfy their minimum tax withholding obligations through net share settlement, pursuant to which the Company withholds the number of shares necessary to satisfy such withholding obligations and pays the obligations in cash. As a result, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we withheld shares valued at approximately million, or approximately per share. Common Stock Dividends

Credit Agreement On July 21, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (the "Original Credit Agreement") with various financial institutions (the Lenders ), Bank of Montreal and Bank of America, N.A. as letters of credit issuers, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders and as swingline lender. The Original Credit Agreement was amended on May 3, 2024, when we entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement (the First Amendment ), which made certain changes to the Original Credit Agreement (the Original Credit Agreement, as amended, modified and supplemented by the First Amendment, is referred to hereafter as the Credit Agreement ). The First Amendment modified the Original Credit Agreement as follows: Increased the amount available for borrowing to million from million; 

 Extended the maturity date to July 21, 2028 from July 21, 2026 (the maturity date of the Credit Agreement will be accelerated to August 15, 2027 if our Senior Notes are not refinanced by that date); 

 National Bank, TD Securities, Bank of Nova Scotia and ING were added as new Lenders and Credit Suisse AG, New York Branch assigned its interests in the Original Credit Agreement to its affiliate UBS AG, Stamford Branch immediately prior to entering into the First Amendment. 

 Proceeds of the revolving loans under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. The interest rate on the outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement is based on the Company s net leverage ratio and is calculated at (i) Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus to or (ii) Bank of America s Base Rate plus to with Base Rate being the 

 13 

or (iii) Term SOFR plus . For each amount drawn, we elect whether we draw on a one, three or six month basis or annual basis for SOFR. If we elect to draw for greater than six months, we pay interest quarterly on the outstanding amount. We are also required to pay a commitment fee of between to , depending on our net leverage ratio. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement bear a fee between and based on our net leverage ratio, as well as a fronting fee to each issuing bank at an agreed upon rate per annum on the average daily dollar amount of our letter of credit exposure. Hecla Mining Company and certain of our subsidiaries are the borrowers under the Credit Agreement, while certain of our other subsidiaries are guarantors of the borrowers obligations under the Credit Agreement. As further security, the Credit Agreement is collateralized by a mortgage on the Greens Creek mine, the equity interests of subsidiaries that own the Greens Creek mine or are part of the Greens Creek Joint Venture and our subsidiary Hecla Admiralty Company (the Greens Creek Group ), and by all of the Greens Creek Group s rights and interests in the Greens Creek Joint Venture Agreement, and in all assets of the joint venture and of any member of the Greens Creek Group. At September 30, 2024, we had net draws o f million outstanding at an interest ra te of , and m illion of outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Agreement. Letters of credit that are outstanding reduce availability under the Credit Agreement. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 . 

of of our foreign currency, and 100 of our metals price exposure may be covered under a derivatives program, with certain other limitations. Our program also utilizes derivatives to manage price risk exposure created from when revenue is recognized from a shipment of concentrate until final settlement. These instruments expose us to (i) credit risk in the form of non-performance by counterparties for contracts in which the contract price exceeds the spot price of the hedged commodity or foreign currency and (ii) price risk to the extent that the spot price or currency exchange rate exceeds the contract price for quantities of our production and/or forecasted costs covered under contract positions. Foreign Currency Our wholly-owned subsidiaries owning the Casa Berardi operation and Keno Hill operation are USD-functional entities which routinely incur expenses denominated in CAD. Such expenses expose us to exchange rate fluctuations between the USD and CAD. We have a program to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the USD exchange rate for these subsidiaries' future operating and capital costs denominated in CAD. The program related to forecasted cash operating costs at Casa Berardi and Keno Hill utilizes forward contracts to buy CAD, some of which are designated as cash flow hedges. As of September 30, 2024, we have a total of forward contracts outstanding to buy a total of CAD million having a notional amount of USD million to hedge the following exposures for 2024 through 2026: Forecasted cash operating costs at Casa Berardi and Keno Hill of CAD million at an average CAD-to-USD exchange rate of . 

 Forecasted capital expenditures at Casa Berardi of CAD million at an average CAD-to-USD exchange rate of . 

 Forecasted capital expenditures at Keno Hill of CAD million at an average CAD-to-USD exchange rate of .

Net realized and unrealized gains of million related to the effective portion of the forward metals contracts designated as hedges were included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of September 30, 2024 . Unrealized gains and losses will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to current earnings as the underlying forecasted sales are recognized. We estimate million in net realized and unrealized gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of September 30, 2024 would be reclassified to current earnings in the next twelve months. The realized gains arose due to cash settlement of zinc contracts prior to maturity in 2022 and zinc and lead contracts during 2023 for net proceeds of million and million, respectively. We recognized a net gain of million, including a million gain transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and a net gain of million, including a million gain transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. We recognized a net loss of million, including a million gain transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and a net gain of million, including a million gain transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These gains and losses were recognized on the contracts utilized to manage exposure to prices of metals in our concentrate shipments, which are included in sales. The net losses and gains recognized on the contracts offset gains and losses related to price adjustments on our provisional concentrate sales due to changes to silver, gold, lead and zinc prices between the time of sale and final settlement. During June 2024, the Company purchased ounces of gold put options priced at per ounce, which are not designated as hedges, to provide price protection for Casa Berardi's underground production for the remainder of 2024 at a total cost of million. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of these gold put optio ns was negative million. Credit-risk-related Contingent Features Certain of our derivative contracts contain cross default provisions which provide that a default under our Credit Agreement would cause a default under the derivative contract. As of September 30, 2024 , we have not posted any collateral related to these contracts. The fair value of derivatives in a net liability position related to these agreements was million as of September 30, 2024, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk. If we were in breach of any of these provisions at September 30, 2024 , we could have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination value of million.

Accounting guidance has established a hierarchy for inputs used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. The three levels included in the hierarchy are: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2: significant other observable inputs; and Level 3: significant unobservable inputs. 

 16 

Level 1 

Current and non-current investments: 

Equity securities

Metal forward contracts 

Level 2 

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds and are valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Current and non-current restricted cash and cash equivalent balances consist primarily of certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury securities, and other deposits and are valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Our non-current investments consist of marketable equity securities of companies in the mining industry which are valued using quoted market prices for each security. Trade accounts receivable from provisional concentrate sales are subject to final pricing and valued using quoted prices based on forward curves for the particular metals. We use financially-settled forward contracts to manage exposure to changes in the exchange rate between USD and CAD, and the impact on CAD-denominated operating and capital costs incurred at our Casa Berardi and Keno Hill operations (see Note 8 for more information). The fair value of each contract represents the present value of the difference between the forward exchange rate for the contract settlement period as of the measurement date and the contract settlement exchange rate. We use financially-settled forward contracts to manage the exposure to changes in prices of silver, gold, zinc and lead contained in our concentrate shipments that have not reached final settlement. We also use financially-settled forward contracts to manage the exposure to changes in prices of gold, zinc and lead contained in our forecasted future sales (see Note 8 for more information). The fair value of each forward contract represents the present value of the difference between the forward metal price for the contract settlement period as of the measurement date and the contract settlement metal price. At September 30, 2024 , our Senior Notes and IQ Notes were recorded at their carrying value of million and million, respectively, net of unamortized initial purchaser discount/premium and issuance costs. The estimated fair values of our Senior Notes and IQ Notes were million and million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 . Quoted market prices, which are considered to be Level 1 inputs, are utilized to estimate fair values of the Senior Notes. Unobservable inputs which are considered to be Level 3, including an assumed current annual yield of , ar e utilized to estimate the fair value of the IQ Notes. See Note 7 for more information. The Credit Agreement, which we consider to be Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, has a carrying and fair value of million .

to the EPA for its past response costs at the site and any future response costs at the site under the Consent Order, and undertake remediation work at the site (the Remedy ), in exchange for a covenant not to sue by the EPA and protection for certain claims of contribution under CERCLA by third parties related to the site. We have accrued million in prior periods, primarily representing estimated current costs to design and implement the Remedy, which are subject to change as fieldwork is performed. The Johnny M Mine is in an area known as the San Mateo Creek Basin SMCB ), which is an approximately 321 square mile area in New Mexico that contains numerous legacy uranium mines and mills. In addition to Johnny M, Hecla Limited s predecessor was involved at other mining sites within the SMCB. The EPA is working with various potentially responsible parties PRPs at the site in order to study and potentially address perceived groundwater issues within the SMCB. The Remedy discussed above relates primarily to contaminated rock and soil at the Johnny M site, not groundwater and not elsewhere within the SMCB site. It is possible that Hecla Limited s liability at the Johnny M Site, and for any other mine site within the SMCB at which Hecla Limited s predecessor may have operated, will be greater than our current accrual of million for the Remedy due to any increased scope of required remediation. In July 2018, the EPA informed Hecla Limited that it and several other PRPs may be liable for cleanup of the SMCB site or for costs incurred by the EPA in cleaning up the site. The EPA stated it has incurred approximately million in response costs to date. In each of May, 2022, and August, 2024, Hecla Limited received a letter from a PRP notifying Hecla Limited that other PRPs may seek cost recovery and contribution from Hecla Limited under CERCLA for certain investigatory work performed by the PRPs at the SMCB site. Hecla Limited cannot with reasonable certainty estimate the amount or range of liability, if any, relating to this matter because of, among other reasons, the lack of information concerning the site, including the relative contributions of contamination by the various PRPs. Carpenter Snow Creek and Barker-Hughesville Sites in Montana In July 2010, the EPA made a formal request to Hecla for information regarding the Carpenter Snow Creek Superfund site located in Cascade County, Montana. The Carpenter Snow Creek site is located in a historical mining district, and in the early 1980s Hecla Limited leased 6 mining claims and performed limited exploration activities at the site. Hecla Limited terminated the mining lease in 1988. In June 2011, the EPA informed Hecla Limited that it believes Hecla Limited, and several other PRPs, may be liable for cleanup of the site or for costs incurred by the EPA in cleaning up the site. The EPA stated in the letter that it has incurred approximately million in response costs and estimated that total remediation costs may exceed million. Hecla Limited cannot with reasonable certainty estimate the amount or range of liability, if any, relating to this matter because of, among other reasons, the lack of information concerning the site, including the relative contributions of contamination by various other PRPs. In February 2017, the EPA made a formal request to Hecla for information regarding the Barker-Hughesville Mining District Superfund site located in Judith Basin and Cascade Counties, Montana. Hecla Limited submitted a response in April 2017. The Barker-Hughesville site is located in a historic mining district, and between approximately June and December 1983, Hecla Limited was party to an agreement with another mining company under which limited exploration activities occurred at or near the site. In August 2018, the EPA informed Hecla Limited that it and several other PRPs may be liable for cleanup of the site or for costs incurred by the EPA in cleaning up the site. The EPA did not include an amount of its alleged response costs to date. Hecla Limited

and undertake a Supplemental Environmental Project involving river habitat restoration on the South Fork of the Coeur d Alene River estimated to cost . Litigation Related to Klondex Acquisition On May 24, 2019, a purported Hecla stockholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Hecla and certain of our executive officers, one of whom was also a director. The complaint, purportedly brought on behalf of all purchasers of Hecla common stock from March 19, 2018 through and including May 8, 2019, asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and seeks, among other things, damages and costs and expenses. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Hecla, under the authority and control of the individual defendants, made certain material false and misleading statements and omitted certain material information regarding Hecla s Nevada Operations. The complaint was dismissed by the Federal District Court with prejudice on September 30, 2024. On October 28, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Related to this class action lawsuit, Hecla has been named as a nominal defendant in a shareholder derivative lawsuit which also names as defendants certain current and past members of Hecla s Board of Directors and certain past officers of Hecla. The case was filed on May 4, 2022 in the Delaware Chancery Court. In general terms, the suit alleges breaches of fiduciary duties by the individual defendants, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment, and seeks damages, purportedly on behalf of Hecla. Debt See Note 7 for information on the commitments related to our debt arrangements as of September 30, 2024. Indirect Taxes In May 2024, our Keno Hill subsidiary received a notice of assessment ("NOA") for goods and services tax ("GST") on its 2023 sales for CAD from the Canada Revenue Agency ("CRA"). In addition, in May 2024 Keno Hill also received correspondence from the CRA for GST on Keno Hill's sales and input tax credits from 2020 through 2022 of CAD . As Keno Hill's sales are to a non-Canadian party, we do not believe Keno Hill is subject to collect and remit GST, and we have disputed the NOA and proposed audit adjustments. Other Commitments Our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 included open purchase orders and commitments of million, million, million, million and million for various capital and non-capital items at Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Keno Hill, Casa Berardi and Other, respectively. We also have total commitments of million relating to scheduled payments on finance leases, including interest, primarily for equipment at our operations, and total commitments of million relating to payments on operating leases (see Note 7 for more information). As part of our ongoing business and operations, we are required to provide surety bonds, bank letters of credit, and restricted deposits for various purposes, including financial support for environmental reclamation obligations and workers compensation programs. As of September 30, 2024 , we had surety bonds totaling million and letters of credit t otaling million in place as financial support for future reclamation and closure costs, self-insurance, and employee benefit plans . The obligations associated with these instruments are generally related to performance requirements that we address through ongoing operations. As the requirements are met, the beneficiary of the associated instruments cancels or returns the instrument to the issuing entity. Certain of these instruments are associated with operating sites with long-lived assets and will remain outstanding until closure of the sites. We believe we are in compliance with all applicable bonding requirements and will be able to satisfy future bonding requirements as they arise. Other Contingencies

 O verview 
 
 Established in 1891, we are the oldest operating precious metals mining company in the United States. We are also the largest silver producer in the United States and Canada, producing over 45 of the U.S. silver production at our Greens Creek and Lucky Friday operations. We also produce gold at our Casa Berardi and Greens Creek operations. In addition, we are developing the Keno Hill mine in the Yukon Territory, Canada which we acquired on September 7, 2022 and began ramp-up during the second quarter of 2023. Based upon the jurisdictions in which we operate, we believe we have lower political and economic risk compared to other mining companies whose mines are located in other parts of the world. Our exploration interests are located in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our operating and strategic framework is based on expanding our production and locating and developing new resource potential in a safe and responsible manner. 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Highlights 
 
 Operational: 
 
 Produced 3.6 million ounces of silver, a 3 increase over the prior year's comparable quarter and 32,280 ounces of gold. See Consolidated Results of Operations below for information on total cost of sales, as well as cash costs and all-in sustaining costs, each after by-product credits, per silver and gold ounce for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Financial:

Raised 57.3 million in equity sales under our ATM program which were utilized to make 49.0 million in net repayments on our outstanding revolving credit facility balance. 

Copper became a payable metal for Greens Creek, recording 0.4 million of copper sales. 

Year to date 2024 Highlights 
 
 Operational: 
 
 Produced 12.3 million ounces of silver, a 8 increase over the prior year's comparable period and 106,196 ounces of gold. See Consolidated Results of Operations below for information on total cost of sales, as well as cash costs and all-in sustaining costs, each after by-product credits, per silver and gold ounce for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

22 

Raised 58.4 million in equity sales under our ATM program which were utilized as part of 115.0 million in net repayments on our outstanding revolving credit facility balance. 

External Factors that Impact our Results 
 
 Our financial results vary as a result of fluctuations in market prices primarily for silver and gold and, to a lesser extent, zinc and lead. World market prices for these commodities have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. We believe that the outlook for precious metals fundamentals in the medium- and long-term is favorable due to macro-economic factors such as lower interest rate expectations, geopolitical uncertainty and global growth expectations, which have resulted in significant volatility in the financial and commodities markets, including the precious metals market. See Item 1A. Risk Factors contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ("2023 Form 10-K"), for further discussion. Because we cannot control the price of our products, the key measures that management focuses on in operating our business are production volumes, payable sales volumes, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce AISC (non-GAAP), operating cash flows, capital expenditures, free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. The average realized prices for all metals sold by us continued to exhibit significant volatility during the period. We have also experienced significant cost inflation across our operations, principally associated with higher energy prices, increased costs for other consumables such as reagents, explosives and steel, and higher labor and contractor costs.

The fluctuations in sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 were primarily due to the following two reasons: 
 
 Higher average realized prices for precious metals and lower realized base metals prices during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The table below summarizes average spot prices and our average realized prices for the commodities we sell:

Average realized prices typically differ from average market prices primarily because concentrate sales are generally recorded as revenues at the time of shipment at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement, which differ from average market prices. Due to the time elapsed between shipment of concentrates and final settlement with the customers, we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled. Previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices each period through final settlement. We recorded net positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of 5.0 million and 19.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 8.1 million and 12.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The price adjustments related to silver, gold, zinc and lead contained in our concentrate shipments were partially offset by gains and losses on forward contracts for those metals. See Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for more information. The gains and losses on these contracts are included in revenues and impact the realized prices for silver, gold, lead and zinc. Realized prices are calculated by dividing gross revenues for each metal (which include the price adjustments and gains and losses on the forward contracts discussed above) by the payable quantities of each metal included in concentrate, dor and carbon material shipped during the period. 
 
 Higher quantities of silver sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to a full third quarter of Lucky Friday sales in 2024 compared to 2023 when production was suspended in August 2023 following a fire in the secondary egress that suspended operations for the remainder of 2023. See The Greens Creek Segment, The Lucky Friday Segment, The Keno Hill Segment, and Casa Berardi Segment sections below for more information on metal production and sales volumes at each of our operating segments. Total metals production and sales volumes for each period are shown in the following table:

The difference between what we report as ounces/tons produced and payable ounces/tons sold is attributable to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in the concentrates we produce versus the portion of those metals actually paid for by our customers according to the terms of our sales contracts. Differences can also arise from inventory 
 24 

changes incidental to shipping schedules, or variances in ore grades which impact the amount of metals contained in concentrates produced and sold.

(1) A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to total cost of sales, the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found below in Reconciliation of Total Cost of Sales (GAAP) to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost, Before By-product Credits and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) . 

(2) The calculation of AISC for our consolidated silver properties includes corporate costs for general and administrative expense and sustaining capital. 

(3) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other includes sales of 7.3 million and 15.1 million, respectively, and total cost of sales of 6.8 million and 14.3 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from our environmental remediation services in the Yukon. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Other includes sales of 1.1 million and 3.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and cost of sales of 0.9 million and 2.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to our environmental remediation services business and Nevada operations. 

While revenue from zinc, lead and gold by-products is significant, we believe that identification of silver as the primary product of Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and Keno Hill is appropriate because: 
 
 silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future; 

we have historically presented the Greens Creek and Lucky Friday units as primary silver producers, based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production, and the same analysis applies to the Keno Hill unit. Further we believe 

25 

that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year; 

metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery; 

the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and Keno Hill deposits are massive sulfide deposits containing an unusually high proportion of silver; and 

in most of their working areas, Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and Keno Hill utilize selective mining methods in which silver is the metal targeted for highest recovery. 

Accordingly, we believe the identification of gold, lead, zinc and copper as by-product credits at Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and Keno Hill is appropriate because of their lower economic value compared to silver and due to the fact that silver is the primary product we intend to produce at those locations. In addition, we have not consistently received sufficient revenue from any single by-product metal to warrant classification of such as a co-product. 
 
 We periodically review our revenues to ensure that reporting of primary products and by-products is appropriate. Because for Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and Keno Hill we consider zinc, lead, gold and copper to be by-products of our silver production, the values of these metals offset operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce. We currently do not report Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce for our Keno Hill operation as it is in the production ramp-up phase and has not met our definition of commercial production, and accordingly it is excluded from our consolidated Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce. We define an operation as being in commercial production upon achievement of the following criteria: 
 
 Completion of operational commissioning of each major mine and mill component; 

Demonstrated ability to mine and mill consistently and without significant interruption, defined as 75 of historical production levels or mill design capacity over a period of 30 days; 

Silver recoveries are at or near expected steady-state production levels; 

All major capital expenditures have been completed; and 

A significant portion of available funding is directed towards operating activities. 

Determination of when these criteria have been met requires the use of judgment, and our definition of commercial production may differ from that of other mining companies. 
 
 We believe the identification of silver as a by-product credit is appropriate at Casa Berardi because of its lower economic value compared to gold and due to the fact that gold is the primary product we intend to produce there. In addition, we do not receive sufficient revenue from silver at the Casa Berardi mine to warrant classification of such as a co-product. Because we consider silver to be a by-product of our gold production at Casa Berardi, the value of silver offsets operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce. 
 
 We reported net income applicable to common stockholders of 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of 22.6 million in the comparable period in 2023. The following were the significant drivers of the change: 
 
 Consolidated gross profit increased by 25.8 million. See The Greens Creek Segment, The Lucky Friday Segment, The Keno Hill Segment, and The Casa Berardi Segment sections below for a discussion on the key drivers by operating unit. 

Ramp-up and suspension costs decreased by 7.3 million as the prior period included 12.0 million of suspension costs related to the temporary suspension of operations at Lucky Friday due to the underground fire, whereas the current period primarily contained costs related to Keno Hill's ramp-up activities and increased by 4.9 million over the comparable period in 2023. 

Other operating income, net increased by 15.4 million primarily due to 14.8 million of insurance proceeds received during the quarter related to the Lucky Friday fire. 

Fair value adjustments, net increased by 10.1 million primarily due to 3.3 million in unrealized gains on our marketable equity securities portfolio in 2024 compared to an unrealized loss of 4.2 million in the comparable period in 2023 and an unrealized gain of 0.4 million on our undesignated derivative contracts compared to a 2.2 million unrealized loss when compared to the comparable period in 2023. 

The positive movements mentioned above were partly offset by: 
 
 A 14.5 million write down of property, plant and equipment which had no salvage value. Of this amount, 13.9 million related to the Lucky Friday remote vein miner machine for which (i) we no longer had a use following the success of the UCB mining 

26 

method at Lucky Friday, (ii) we had been unsuccessful in locating a buyer, and (iii) the vendor advised us during the period that it would discontinue support for the program. 

Net foreign exchange loss increased by 7.4 million to a loss of 3.2 million, compared to a gain of 4.2 million in the comparable period, reflecting the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar in 2024, compared to a devaluation in the comparable period in 2023 , and related impact on the revaluation of our Canadian monetary assets and liabilities. 

Income and mining tax expense increased by 13.0 million due to higher taxable income generated by our US tax group. 

We reported net income applicable to common stockholders of 23.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of 41.7 million in the comparable period in 2023. The following were the significant drivers of the change: 
 
 Ramp-up and suspension costs decreased by 14.9 million as costs incurred in the prior period related to the temporary suspension of operations at Casa Berardi for 20 days resulting from certain forest lands and access road closures due to forest fires and the temporary suspension of operations at Lucky Friday due to an underground fire were not incurred in 2024. 

Other operating income, net increased by 45.4 million primarily due to 50.0 million of insurance proceeds received during the period related to the Lucky Friday fire. Other operating income, net in the prior period included 5.9 million of insurance proceeds related to a coverage lawsuit. 

Fair value adjustments, net increased by 12.6 million primarily due to 9.0 million of unrealized gains on our marketable equity securities portfolio in 2024 compared to an unrealized loss of 7.6 million the comparable period in 2023. This was partially offset by unrealized losses on undesignated derivative contracts of 2.1 million in 2024 compared to an unrealized gain of 1.8 million in the comparable period in 2023. 

Net foreign exchange gain increased by 3.0 million to 3.4 million reflecting the continued strengthening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar, and related impact on the revaluation of our Canadian monetary assets and liabilities. 

The positive movements mentioned above were partly offset by: 
 A 14.5 million write down of property, plant and equipment which had no salvage value. Of this amount, 13.9 million related to the Lucky Friday remote vein miner machine for which (i) we no longer had a use following the success of the UCB mining method at Lucky Friday, (ii) we had been unsuccessful in locating a buyer, and (iii) the vendor advised us during the period that it would discontinue support for the program. 

General and administrative expenses increased by 5.9 million, primarily related to non-recurring non-cash compensation costs associated with our former CEO's retirement in the second quarter and higher incentive compensation accruals. 

Interest expense increased by 4.9 million as higher amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility. 

Income and mining tax expense increased by 15.4 million due to higher taxable income generated by our US tax group.

The 6.8 million increase in gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to higher realized sales prices for silver and gold, partially offset by lower metals sales volumes. Capital additions were largely consistent with the comparable period, decreasing by 0.6 million. 
 
 The 8.0 million increase in gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to higher realized sales prices for silver and gold, partially offset by lower metals sales volumes. Capital additions increased by 4.5 million in the same period primarily due to primary ore access development. 
 
 Production during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, declined primarily due to a combination of unplanned semi-antogenous grinding ("SAG") mill maintenance and lower grade. Throughput for the quarter averaged 2,314 tons per day, a decline of 7 as various mill maintenance projects were completed during the quarter, including SAG liners inspection, bolts retorquing, as well as work completed during a 7-day unscheduled maintenance event, of which 5 were in September. The mill restarted during early October and we expect similar production levels in the fourth quarter as during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce was primarily due to an increase in by-product credits, benefiting from higher realized gold prices, partly offset by higher production costs and lower ounces produced. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce was slightly lower compared to the comparable period from 2023, as higher production costs were offset by higher by-product credits on a per ounce basis, benefiting from higher realized gold prices. In addition to the factors impacting Cash Cost per Silver Ounce, AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce was also impacted by higher sustaining capital.

During August 2023, mining was suspended due to a fire which occurred while repairing an unused station in the #2 ventilation shaft, which is also the secondary egress. By early September, the fire had been extinguished, normal ventilation was reestablished and the workforce recalled. Following evaluation of alternatives, it was determined that in order to safely bring the mine back into production in the most rapid and cost-effective way, a new secondary egress needed to be developed to bypass the damaged portion of the #2 shaft. The new egress involved extending an existing ramp 1,600 feet, installing a 290-foot-long manway raise, and developing an 850-foot ventilation raise. This work resulted in operations being suspended for the remainder of 2023, with the mine restarting production on January 9, 2024, and ramping up to full production during the first quarter. The Company has property and business interruption insurance coverage with an underground sub-limit of 50.0 million, and through September 30, 2024, has received the full coverage amount of 50.0 million. The discussion of Lucky Friday's results below for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, has been impacted by the prior suspension of operations.

Gross profit increased by 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting a combination of higher sales volumes for all metals and higher realized sales prices for silver, as the mine suspended operations in August 2023 and did not resume operations until January 9, 2024. 
 
 Gross profit increased by 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting higher realized prices for silver, and higher sales volumes for all metals produced due to the suspension of mining operations mentioned above. 
 
 For both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023, 12.0 million of site specific suspension costs were included within Ramp-up and suspension costs. 
 Capital additions decreased by 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased by 9.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Capital expenditures decreased during 2024 as the prior period included expenditures for bolters, the installation of a service hoist and the coarse ore bunker.

Since acquiring our Keno Hill operations as part of the acquisition of Alexco Resource Corp. ("Alexco") on September 7, 2022, we have focused on development activities, with initial operation of the mill beginning in the second quarter of 2023. The average throughput during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 314 tons per day, with silver grades milled of 25.6 ounces per ton. Since commencing production, mill throughput has generally increased as planned, leading to increased levels of production. However, we expect 2025 silver production to remain similar to 2024 as we focus on stakeholder engagement, permitting, infrastructure and capital projects, with production projected to increase again in 2026. The pause in silver production growth at Keno Hill is a direct result of the heap leach failure at Victoria Gold s Eagle Mine in late June 2024. This failure had several immediate and ongoing impacts on our operations. The primary impact was the Company was forced to suspend milling operations at Keno Hill on August 27, 2024, due to delays in receiving an authorization to construct and a permit modification Keno Hill s dry stack tailings storage facility DSTF ). The delayed authorization and permit were a result of the focus of the Yukon Government YG and the First Nation of Na-Cho Ny k Dun FNNND on Eagle Mine incident response and not on routine permitting matters. Mill operations resumed on October 26, 2024 after receiving the authorization and modification and completing related design and construction work on the DSTF. A second impact of the Eagle Mine incident has been expression of strong positions by the FNNND on continuing and future mining activities at projects within their Traditional Territory, where Keno Hill is located, including a call to halt mining production. We are committed to responsible and sustainable mining that governments and local communities support. As such, the projected flat production levels at Keno Hill for 2025 should allow us to focus on stakeholder outreach and ensuring we have local support for increasing production levels by 2026. In 2025, the Company's environmental remediation services group is also expected to increase construction activities, adding incremental demand on Keno Hill's infrastructure and resources. 
 33 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Keno Hill recorded sales and total cost of sales of 19.8 million related to concentrate produced and sold. The third quarter of 2024 had 10.0 million of site-specific ramp-up costs, compared to 5.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, due to the mill shutdown. During the quarter, Keno Hill recorded capital additions of 14.4 million, related to mine development, work on the DSTF and other mining equipment purchases. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Keno Hill recorded sales and total cost of sales of 59.6 million related to concentrate produced and sold. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 had 20.4 million of site-specific ramp up costs included in ramp-up and suspension costs. During the current year, Keno Hill recorded capital additions of 39.3 million, primarily related to mine development, work on the DSTF, a surface backfill plant and other mining equipment purchases.

As part of the transition of the Casa Berardi mine from a combined underground and open pit operation to an open pit only operation, the lower margin east mine underground operations were closed in July 2023 and, along with mining the 160 open pit, only the higher margin stopes of the west underground mine will be mined until they are exhausted, which is expected to occur in mid-2025, at which time most underground activity is expected to cease. Following the halt to underground mining, Casa Berardi is expected to only produce gold from the 160 open pit, and at lower volumes than historic production levels with production expected to conclude in 2027. We forecast a gap in production commencing in 2027 and lasting until 2032 or later, when no ore is expected to be mined and no revenue is expected. During this hiatus, our focus is expected to be on investing in infrastructure and equipment, permitting and de-watering and stripping two expected new open pits, Principal and West Mine Crown Pillar. Upon conclusion of the hiatus and related permitting and construction, the mine is expected to generate significant free cash flow at current gold prices. 
 
 Gross profit increased by 13.9 million to 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gross loss of 9.9 million in the same period in 2023. The increase in gross profit is primarily related to higher realized prices, partly offset by lower gold ounces sold, and lower depreciation costs in the current quarter due to the west underground mine being fully depreciated during the first half of the year. Capital additions increased by 2.4 million during the quarter, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily related to a tailings dam raise. 
 
 Gross loss decreased by 6.2 million to 21.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gross loss of 27.5 million in the same period in 2023. The decrease in gross loss primarily relates to an increase in realized gold prices, partly offset by lower gold ounces sold and a 9.3 million reduction in production costs due to the closure of the east mine in July 2023. These 
 34 

items were partly offset by a 18.8 million increase in depreciation expense, reflecting the west underground mine being fully depreciated during the first half of the year, in line with the initial expectation of underground mining ceasing in the first half of 2024 and 6.3 million in product inventory net realizable value write downs attributable to higher depreciation. Capital additions decreased by 9.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily related to the cessation of capitalization of underground development. The majority of capital additions for the current year are related to a tailings dam raise. 
 
 Although Casa Berardi generated gross profit during the third quarter of 2024, it has generated gross losses during the previous eight quarters. This lack of profitability, the expected hiatus in future production discussed above, and the uncertainty surrounding permitting and timing of construction of the new open pits, has caused us to undertake a review of how Casa Berardi fits into the Company s future strategy. While it is possible we may continue down the path towards future production at the Principal and West Mine Crown Pillar pits, we are also examining potential strategic alternatives.

The increase in Cash Cost After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to lower gold production and higher production costs. Higher AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce reflected lower gold production and higher sustaining capital over the comparable period in 2023. 
 
 The increase in Cash Cost After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to lower gold production, partly offset by lower production costs from the cessation of underground mining of the east mine during July 2023. Sustaining capital decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting no underground development and the prior period containing machinery and equipment expenditures related to surface operations positively impacted AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce. 
 
 Corporate Matters 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, an income and mining tax provision of 11.5 million and 22.3 million, respectively, resulted in an effective tax rate of 86.7 and 48.3 , respectively. This compares to an income and mining tax benefit of 1.5 million and an income and mining tax provision of 6.9 million which resulted in an effective tax rate of 6.3 and -20.1 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The comparability of our income and mining tax provision and effective tax rate for the reported periods was impacted by multiple factors, primarily: (i) mining taxes; (ii) variations in our income before income taxes; (iii) geographic distribution of that income; (iv) foreign exchange rates including non-recognition of foreign exchange gains and losses; (v) percentage depletion; and (vi) the non-recognition of tax assets. The effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, period to period. The change in the effective tax rate during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable periods in 2023 is primarily related to the reported consolidated income (loss) as well as the losses incurred at our consolidated Alexco subsidiaries, and our Nevada subsidiaries, for which no tax benefit is recognized due to uncertainty surrounding our ability to utilize these future tax benefits. 
 
 Each reporting period we assess our deferred tax balances based on a review of long-range forecasts and quarterly activity. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not the related tax benefits will not be realized. We analyze our deferred tax assets and, if it is determined that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we record or increase a valuation allowance. Conversely, if it is determined we will ultimately more likely than not be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced. There are a number of factors that impact our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are provided on deferred tax assets in Nevada, Mexico, and certain Canadian jurisdictions. For additional information, please see risk factors Our accounting and other estimates may be imprecise and Our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and other items is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income in Item 1A - Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Re conciliation of Total Cost of Sales to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost, Before By-product Credits and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) 
 
 The tables below present reconciliations between the most comparable GAAP measure of total cost of sales to the non-GAAP measures of (i) Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, (ii) Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, (iii) AISC, Before By-product Credits and (iv) AISC, After By-product Credits for our operations and for the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce are measures developed by precious metals companies (including the Silver Institute and the World Gold Council) in an effort to provide a uniform standard for comparison purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that these non-GAAP measures as we report them are the same as those reported by other mining companies. 
 
 37 

Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce is an important operating statistic that we utilize to measure each mine's operating performance. We use AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce as a measure of our mines' net cash flow after costs for reclamation and sustaining capital. This is similar to the Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce non-GAAP measure we report, but also includes reclamation and sustaining capital costs. Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain silver and gold production. Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce also allow us to benchmark the performance of each of our mines versus those of our competitors. As a silver and gold mining company, we also use these statistics on an aggregate basis - aggregating the Greens Creek and Lucky Friday mines to compare our performance with that of other silver mining companies. Similarly, these statistics are useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as they provide a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics. 
 
 We have not disclosed cost per ounce statistics for the Keno Hill operation as it is in the production ramp-up phase and has not met our definition of commercial production. See above " Consolidated Results of Operations " for our definition of commercial production. Determination of when those criteria have been met requires the use of judgment, and our definition of commercial production may differ from that of other mining companies. 
 
 Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and AISC, Before By-product Credits include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals, including mining, processing and other plant costs, third-party refining expense, on-site general and administrative costs, royalties and mining production taxes. AISC, Before By-product Credits for each mine also includes reclamation and sustaining capital costs. AISC, Before By-product Credits for our consolidated silver properties also includes corporate costs for general and administrative expense and sustaining capital costs. By-product credits include revenues earned from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit. As depicted in the tables below, by-product credits comprise an essential element of our silver unit cost structure, distinguishing our silver operations due to the polymetallic nature of their orebodies. 
 
 In addition to the uses described above, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce provide management and investors an indication of operating cash flow, after consideration of the average price received from production. We also use these measurements for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations period-to-period from a cash flow perspective. We currently do not report Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce for our Keno Hill operation as it is in the ramp-up phase of production and accordingly it is excluded from our consolidated Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce. 
 
 Casa Berardi reports Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce for the production of gold, their primary product, and by-product revenues earned from silver, which is a by-product at Casa Berardi. Only costs and ounces produced relating to units with the same primary product are combined to represent Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce. Thus, the gold produced at Casa Berardi is not included as a by-product credit when calculating Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce for the total of Greens Creek and Lucky Friday, our combined silver properties. Similarly, the silver produced at our other three units is not included as a by-product credit when calculating the gold metrics for Casa Berardi.

Fin ancial Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 50 

We have a disciplined cash management strategy of maintaining financial flexibility to execute our capital priorities and provide long-term value to our stockholders. Consistent with that strategy, we aim to maintain an acceptable level of net debt and sufficient liquidity to fund debt service costs, operations, capital expenditures, exploration and pre-development projects, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and potential share repurchases. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 22.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which 8.8 million was held in foreign subsidiaries' local currency that we anticipate utilizing for near-term operating, exploration or capital costs by those foreign subsidiaries. At September 30, 2024, we had utilized 13.0 million drawn on our credit facility of 225 million, with 6.3 million used for letters of credit and the remainder available as borrowings. We also have USD cash and cash equivalent balances held by our foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated, may be subject to withholding taxes. We expect that there would be no additional tax burden upon repatriation after considering the cash cost associated with the withholding taxes. We believe that our liquidity and capital resources from our U.S. operations are adequate to fund our U.S. operations and corporate activities. 
 
 Pursuant to our common stock dividend policy described in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, our Board of Directors declared and paid dividends on our common stock and preferred of 8.7 million and 16.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 3.9 million and 11.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our dividend policy has a silver-linked component which ties the amount of declared common stock dividends to our realized silver price for the preceding quarter. Another component of our common stock dividend policy anticipates paying an annual minimum dividend. 
 
 For illustrative purposes only, the table below summarizes potential dividend amounts under our dividend policy.

The declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare and pay common stock dividends in the future. 
 
 Pursuant to our stock repurchase program described in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, we are authorized to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our outstanding common stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued by us at any time. Whether or not we engage in repurchases from time to time may depend on a variety of factors, including not only price and cash resources, but customary black-out restrictions, whether we have any material inside information, limitations on share repurchases or cash usage that may be imposed by our credit agreement or in connection with issuances of securities, alternative uses for cash, applicable law, and other investment opportunities from time to time. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 934,100 shares had been purchased in prior periods at an average price of 3.99 per share, leaving 19.1 million shares that may yet be purchased under the program. We have not repurchased any shares since June 2014. 
 
 As discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) pursuant to an equity distribution agreement dated February 18, 2021, we may offer and sell up to 60 million shares of our common stock from time to time to or through sales agents in at-the-market offerings. Sales of the shares, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers transactions or as otherwise agreed between the Company and the agents as principals. Whether or not we engage in sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors, including share price, our cash resources, customary black-out restrictions, and whether we have any material inside information. The equity distribution agreement can be terminated by us at any time. Any sales of shares under that agreement are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 9,090,726 shares under the agreement for proceeds of 57.3 million, net of commissions and fees of 0.9 million and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 9,339,287 shares under the agreement for proceeds of 58.4 million, net of commissions and fees of 0.94 million. 
 
 As a result of our current cash balances, the performance of our current and expected operations, current metals prices, proceeds from potential at-the-market sales of common stock, and availability under our Credit Agreement, we believe we will be able to meet 
 51 

our obligations and other potential cash requirements during the next 12 months and beyond. Our obligations and other uses of cash may include, but are not limited to: debt service obligations related to the Senior Notes and IQ Notes; principal and interest payments under our Credit Agreement; ramp up and suspension costs; capital expenditures at our operations; potential acquisitions of other mining companies or properties; regulatory matters; litigation; potential repurchases of our common stock under the program described above; and payment of dividends on common stock, if declared by our Board of Directors. 
 
 We currently estimate a range of approximately 196 to 218 million (before any lease financing) will be invested in 2024 on capital expenditures, primarily for equipment, infrastructure, and development at our mines, including 153.7 million already incurred as of September 30, 2024. We also estimate exploration and pre-development expenditures will total approximately 31.5 million in 2024, including 21.6 million already incurred as of September 30, 2024. Our expenditures for these items and our related plans for 2024 may change based upon our financial position, metals prices, and other considerations. Our ability to fund the activities described above will depend on our operating performance, metals prices, our ability to estimate revenues and costs, sources of liquidity available to us, including the revolving credit facility (which requires compliance with certain financial and other covenants), and other factors. A sustained downturn in metals prices, significant increase in operational or capital costs or other uses of cash, poor results of our operating units, our inability to access the credit facility or the sources of liquidity discussed above, or other factors beyond our control could impact our plans. 
 
 We may defer some capital investment and/or exploration and pre-development activities, engage in asset sales or secure additional capital if necessary to maintain liquidity. We also may pursue additional acquisition opportunities, which could require additional equity issuances or other forms of financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us.

Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of 150.8 million represents a 76.2 million increase compared to the 74.6 million provided in the same period for 2023. 106.3 million of the variance was attributable to higher income adjusted for non-cash items, reflecting higher non-cash depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, a foreign exchange gain and write down of property, plant and equipment. The increase was partly offset by negative net working capital changes resulting from higher accounts receivable balances reflecting the timing of sales at Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and Keno Hill and an increase in inventories at Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi and Keno Hill.

Capital expenditures decreased by 7.6 million compared to the same period in 2023. The variance was primarily due to lower capital spending at Lucky Friday and Casa Berardi, partially offset by higher capital spending at Greens Creek.

(2) The Credit Agreement provides for a 225 million revolving credit facility. We had net draws of 13.0 million and 6.3 million in letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The amounts in the table above assume no additional amounts will be drawn in future periods, and include only the standby fee on the current undrawn balance and accrued interest. For more information on our credit facility, see Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) . 

(3) Includes scheduled finance lease payments of 3.9 million, 4.6 million, 7.2 million, and 5.5 million for equipment at Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi, and Keno Hill, respectively. 

(4) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease arrangements. 

(5) On February 19, 2020, we completed an offering of 475 million in aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes due February 15, 2028. The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25 per year, with interest payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. See Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for more information. 

(6) On July 9, 2020, we entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued our IQ Notes for CAD 50 million (approximately USD 36.8 million at the time of the transaction) in aggregate principal amount. The IQ Notes bear interest on amounts outstanding at a rate of 6.515 per year, payable on January 9 and July 9 of each year. See Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for more information. 

We record liabilities for costs associated with mine closure, reclamation of land and other environmental matters. At September 30, 2024, our liabilities for these matters totaled 118.6 million. Future expenditures related to closure, reclamation and environmental expenditures at our sites are difficult to estimate, although we anticipate we will incur expenditures relating to these obligations over the next 30 years. For additional information relating to our environmental obligations, see Note 11 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) . 
 
 Criti cal Accounting Estimates 
 
 There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in Critical Accounting Policies in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Exhibit 99.1 to the May 20, 2024 8-K. 
 
 Off-B alance Sheet Arrangements 	 
 53 

At September 30, 2024, we had no existing off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC regulations, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 
 Guar antor Subsidiaries 
 
 Presented below are Hecla s unaudited interim condensed consolidating financial statements as required by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, resulting from the guarantees by certain of Hecla's subsidiaries of the Senior Notes and IQ Notes (see Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for more information). The Guarantors consist of the following of Hecla's 100 -owned subsidiaries: Hecla Limited; Silver Hunter Mining Company; Rio Grande Silver, Inc.; Hecla MC Subsidiary, LLC; Hecla Silver Valley, Inc.; Burke Trading, Inc.; Hecla Montana, Inc.; Revett Silver Company; RC Resources, Inc.; Troy Mine Inc.; Revett Exploration, Inc.; Revett Holdings, Inc.; Mines Management, Inc.; Newhi, Inc.; Montanore Minerals Corp.; Hecla Alaska LLC; Hecla Greens Creek Mining Company; Hecla Admiralty Company; Hecla Juneau Mining Company; Klondex Holdings Inc.; Klondex Gold Silver Mining Co.; Klondex Midas Holdings Limited; Klondex Aurora Mine Inc.; Klondex Hollister Mine Inc.; Hecla Quebec, Inc.; and Alexco Resource Corp. We completed the offering of the Senior Notes on February 19, 2020 under our shelf registration statement previously filed with the SEC. We issued the IQ Notes in four equal tranches between July and October 2020. 
 
 The unaudited interim condensed consolidating financial statements below have been prepared from our financial information on the same basis of accounting as the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements set forth elsewhere in this report. Investments in the subsidiaries are accounted for under the equity method. Accordingly, the entries necessary to consolidate Hecla, the Guarantors, and our non-guarantor subsidiaries are reflected in the intercompany eliminations column. In the course of preparing consolidated financial statements, we eliminate the effects of various transactions conducted between Hecla and its subsidiaries and among the subsidiaries. While valid at an individual subsidiary level, such activities are eliminated in consolidation because, when taken as a whole, they do not represent business activity with third-party customers, vendors, and other parties. Examples of such eliminations include the following: 
 
 Investments in subsidiaries . The acquisition of a company results in an investment in debt or equity capital on the records of the parent company and a contribution to debt or equity capital on the records of the subsidiary. Such investments and capital contributions are eliminated in consolidation. 

Capital contributions . Certain of Hecla's subsidiaries do not generate cash flow, either at all or that is sufficient to meet their capital needs, and their cash requirements are routinely met with inter-company advances from their parent companies. Generally on an annual basis, when not otherwise intended as debt, the Boards of Directors of such parent companies declare contributions of capital to their subsidiary companies, which increase the parents' investment and the subsidiaries' additional paid-in capital. Occasionally, parent companies may also subscribe for additional common shares of their subsidiaries. In consolidation, investments in subsidiaries and related additional paid-in capital are eliminated. 

Debt. At times, inter-company debt agreements have been established between certain of Hecla's subsidiaries and their parents. The related debt liability and receivable balances, accrued interest expense (if any) and income activity (if any), and payments of principal and accrued interest amounts (if any) by the subsidiary companies to their parents are eliminated in consolidation. 

Dividends. Certain of Hecla's subsidiaries which generate cash flow routinely provide cash to their parent companies through inter-company transfers. On at least an annual basis, the Boards of Directors of such subsidiary companies declare dividends to their parent companies, which reduces the subsidiaries' retained earnings and increases the parents' dividend income. In consolidation, such activity is eliminated. 

Deferred taxes . Our ability to realize deferred tax assets and liabilities is considered for two consolidated tax groups of subsidiaries within the United States: The Nevada U.S. Group and the Hecla U.S. Group. Within each tax group, all subsidiaries' estimated future taxable income contributes to the ability of their tax group to realize all such assets and liabilities. However, when Hecla's subsidiaries are viewed independently, we use the separate return method to assess the realizability of each subsidiary's deferred tax assets and whether a valuation allowance is required against such deferred tax assets. In some instances, a parent company or subsidiary may possess deferred tax assets whose realization depends on the future taxable incomes of other subsidiaries on a consolidated-return basis, but would not be considered realizable if such parent or subsidiary filed on a separate stand-alone basis. In such a situation, a valuation allowance is assessed on that subsidiary's deferred tax assets, with the resulting adjustment reported in the eliminations column of the guarantor and parent's financial statements, as is the case in the unaudited interim financial statements set forth below. The separate return method can result in significant eliminations of deferred tax assets and liabilities and related income tax provisions and benefits. Non-current deferred tax asset balances are included in other non-current assets on the consolidating balance sheets and make up a large portion of that item, particularly for the guarantor balances. 

54 

Separate financial statements of the Guarantors are not presented because the guarantees by the Guarantors are joint and several and full and unconditional, except for certain customary release provisions, including: (1) the sale or disposal of all or substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor; (2) the sale or other disposition of the capital stock of the Guarantor; (3) the Guarantor is designated as an unrestricted entity in accordance with the applicable provisions of the indenture; (4) Hecla ceases to be a borrower as defined in the indenture; and (5) upon legal or covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture.

Item 3. Qua ntitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The following discussion about our exposure to market risks and risk management activities includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as summarizes the financial instruments held by us at September 30, 2024, which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates and are not held for trading purposes. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In the normal course of business, we also face risks that are either non-financial or non-quantifiable (See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024). 
 
 Metals Prices 
 
 Changes in the market prices of silver, gold, lead and zinc can significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. Metals prices can and often do fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control (see Item 1A Risk Factors A substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us in our 2023 Form 10-K). We utilize financially-settled forward and put option contracts to manage our exposure to changes in prices for silver, gold, zinc and lead. 
 Provisional Sales 
 
 Sales of all metals products sold directly to customers, including by-product metals, are recorded as revenues when all performance obligations have been completed and the transaction price can be determined or reasonably estimated. For concentrate sales, revenues are generally recorded at the time of shipment at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement. Due to the time elapsed between shipment to the customer and the final settlement with the customer, we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled. Previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices until final settlement by the customer. Changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement will result in changes to revenues previously recorded upon shipment. Metals prices can and often do fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control (see Item 1A Risk Factors A substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us in our 2023 Form 10-K). At September 30, 2024, metals contained in concentrate sales and exposed to future price changes totaled 1.5 million ounces of silver, 500 ounces of gold, 22,525 tons of zinc and 51,650 tons of lead. If the price for each metal were to change by 10 , the change in the total value of the concentrates sold would be approximately 21.3 million. As discussed in Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) , we utilize a program designed and intended to mitigate the risk of negative price adjustments with limited mark-to-market financially-settled forward contracts for our silver, gold, zinc and lead sales. 
 
 Commodity-Price Risk Management 
 
 See Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for a description of our commodity-price risk management program. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk Management 
 
 We operate and have mining interests in Canada, which exposes us to risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates between the USD and the CAD. We determined the functional currency for our Canadian operations is the USD. As such, foreign exchange gains and losses associated with the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities from CAD to USD are recorded to earnings each period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net foreign exchange loss of 3.2 million and net foreign exchange gain of 3.4 million, respectively, compared to a net foreign exchange gain of 4.2 million and 0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates are influenced by a number of factors beyond our control. A 10 change in the exchange rate between the USD and CAD from the rate at September 30, 2024 would have resulted in a change of approximately 7.3 million in our net foreign exchange gain or loss. We do not hedge the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. We do hedge some of our operating and capital costs denominated in CAD. 
 
 See Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for a description of our foreign currency risk management program. 
 
 57 

Item 4. Con trols and Procedures 
 
 An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Interim Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, including controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us is accumulated and communicated to our management (including our CEO and CFO), were effective as of September 30, 2024, in assuring them in a timely manner that material information required to be disclosed in this report has been properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Internal control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even a system which is determined to be effective cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected or prevented. Our systems of internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

 (c)	The Dividend Equivalent Amount with respect to any Trust Shares means (i) the amount of cash, plus the fair market value as determined by the Board on the date of distribution of any property, other than stock of the Corporation, plus (ii) any shares of stock of the 
 2 

Exhibit 10.3 

 Corporation, in each case which the Participant would have received as dividends or other distributions with respect to the Trust Shares, if the Trust Shares had been delivered to the Participant as shares of Common Stock at the time they were credited to the Participant under this Plan, plus (iii) interest on the amount described in clauses (i) plus (ii) at a rate equal to the Corporation s cost of funds, from the date or date(s) such dividends or other distributions would have been received through the date the Trust Shares are delivered. 
 (d)	If a Participant s Delivery Date is described in clause (iv) (normal cessation of service), clause (v) (Change in Control) or clause (vi) (specified date) of Section 6(b) above, all Trust Shares and all Dividend Equivalent Amounts with respect thereto shall be delivered at one time, as soon as practicable after the Delivery Date. If a Participant s Delivery Date is described in clause (i) (death), clause (ii) (Disability) or clause (iii) (retirement) of Section 6(b) above, the Trust Shares and the Dividend Equivalent Amounts with respect thereto shall be delivered at one time, as soon as practicable after the Delivery Date, unless the Participant has in effect a valid Installment Delivery Election pursuant to Section 6(e) below to have the Trust Shares and Dividend Equivalent Amounts delivered in yearly installments over 5, 10 or 15 years (the Applicable Delivery Period ). If the Participant does have in effect a valid Installment Delivery Election, then the Trust Shares, together with the Dividend Equivalent Amounts with respect thereto, shall be delivered in equal yearly installments over the Applicable Delivery Period, with the first such installment being delivered on the first anniversary of the Delivery Date; provided, that if in order to equalize such installments, fractional shares would have to be delivered, such installments shall be adjusted by rounding to the nearest whole share. If any Trust Shares and Dividend Equivalent Amounts of a Participant are to be delivered after the Participant has died or become legally incompetent, they shall be delivered to the Participant s estate or legal guardian, as the case may be, in accordance with the foregoing schedules; provided, that if the Participant dies with a valid Installment Delivery Election in effect, and the legal representatives of the Participant s estate so request, the Board may (but shall not be obligated to) deliver all remaining undelivered Trust Shares and Dividend Equivalent Amounts to the Participant s estate immediately. References to the Participant in this Plan shall be deemed to refer to the Participant s estate or legal guardian, where appropriate. 
 (e)	An Installment Delivery Election means a written election by a Participant, on such form as may be prescribed by the Board, to receive delivery of Trust Shares and Dividend Equivalent Amounts in installments over a period of 5, 10 or 15 years, as more fully described in Section 6(d) above. Once made, an Installment Delivery Election may be superseded by another Installment Delivery Election. However, in order for any initial or superseding Installment Delivery Election to be valid, it must be received by the Corporation prior to the first day of the year in which the applicable shares of Common Stock are credited to the Participant under Section 5. In the case of multiple Installment Delivery Elections and/or revocations by any Participant, the most recent valid Installment Delivery Election or revocation in effect as of the Delivery Date shall be controlling. No Delivery Elections once made can be accelerated and any elections to further defer Delivery Elections must be made in accordance with the following: 
 (i)	Such election will not take effect until 12 months after the election is made; 
 3 

Exhibit 10.3 

 (ii)	Any subsequent election other than under Section 6(b)(i) or Section 6(b)(ii) above must be for a period of at least 5 years from the date such Delivery Election issuance would otherwise have been made under the Plan; and 
 (iii)	With respect to any Delivery Election issuance to be made at a specified time or pursuant to a fixed schedule pursuant to an election at the time of such initial deferral, such election must be made at least 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled Delivery Election issuance under such initial election. 
 (f)	 Disability shall mean (i) the Participant is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, (ii) the Participant is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three months under an accident and health plan covering service providers of the Corporation or (iii) any other definition provided under Section 409A. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, in the event that the timing of payments under the Plan (that would otherwise be considered deferred compensation subject to Section 409A) would be accelerated upon the occurrence of a Disability, no such acceleration shall be permitted unless the Disability also satisfies the definition of disability pursuant to Section 409A.
