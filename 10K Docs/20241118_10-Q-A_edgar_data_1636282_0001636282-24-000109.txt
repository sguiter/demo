 segment and has its principal offices in Waltham, Massachusetts. 
 On September 8, 2023, the Company effected a reverse stock split of its Common Stock at a ratio of 1-for-25 (the Reverse Split ). Except as indicated otherwise, all share numbers related to the Company's Common Stock disclosed in these financial statements have been adjusted on a post-Reverse Split basis. 
 On April 12, 2023, based on the review of the inconclusive interim results from the Company's Phase 1/2 clinical trial of pegtarviliase for the treatment of Classical Homocystinuria and other business considerations, the Company announced that it had initiated a process to explore strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value and engaged an independent exclusive financial advisor to support this process. As a result, in April 2023, the Company implemented a restructuring plan resulting in an approximate reduction of the Company s existing headcount. 
 On June 22, 2023, the Company acquired, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Acquisition Agreement"), the assets of Spyre Therapeutics, Inc. Pre-Merger Spyre ), a privately held biotechnology company advancing a pipeline of antibody therapeutics with the potential to transform the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease through a research and development option agreement ("Paragon Agreement") with Paragon Therapeutics ("Paragon"). The asset acquisition was accomplished through a two-step reverse triangular merger whereby a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company merged with and into Pre-Merger Spyre, which existed at the time the Acquisition Agreement was entered into, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement. Immediately following this merger, Pre-Merger Spyre merged with an into a second wholly subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement and Pre-Merger Spyre ceased to exist. Subsequently, Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc. was renamed Spyre Therapeutics, Inc. and is a different entity than Pre-Merger Spyre, which ceased to exist upon merging with Merger Sub. The transaction was structured as a stock-for-stock transaction pursuant to which all of Pre-Merger Spyre's outstanding equity interests were exchanged based on a fixed exchange ratio of to 1 for consideration from the Company of shares of common stock, par value of per share ("Common Stock"), and shares of Series A non-voting convertible preferred stock, par value of per share ("Series A Preferred Stock") (convertible on a to 1 basis), in addition to the assumption of outstanding and unexercised stock options to purchase shares of Common Stock from the Amended and Restated Spyre 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Asset Acquisition"). The Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock related to the Asset Acquisition were issued to the Pre-Merger Spyre stockholders on July 7, 2023. 
 In connection with the Asset Acquisition, on June 26, 2023, the Company completed a private placement of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the June 2023 PIPE to a group of investors (the June 2023 Investors ). The Company sold an aggregate of shares of Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million before deducting approximately million in placement agent and other offering expenses (together with the Asset Acquisition, the Transactions ). 
 In connection with the Asset Acquisition, a non-transferable contingent value right ("CVR") was distributed to stockholders of record of the Company as of the close of business on July 3, 2023 (the "Legacy Stockholders"), but was not distributed to the holders of shares of Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock issued to the former stockholders of Pre-Merger Spyre or the June 2023 Investors in the Transactions. Holders of the CVRs will be entitled to receive cash payments from proceeds received by the Company for a period related to the disposition or monetization of its legacy assets for a period of following the closing of the Asset Acquisition. 
 On November 21, 2023, the Company's stockholders approved the conversion of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock to Common Stock.

per share ("Series B Preferred Stock") (convertible on a to 1 basis) (the December 2023 PIPE to a group of investors. The Company sold an aggregate of shares of Common Stock and shares of Series B Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million before deducting approximately million of placement agent and other offering expenses. 
 On March 20, 2024, the Company completed a private placement of Series B Preferred Stock (convertible on a to 1 basis) (the March 2024 PIPE to a group of investors. The Company sold shares of Series B Preferred Stock for a purchase price of million before deducting approximately million of placement agent and other offering costs. 
 Liquidity 
 The Company is a preclinical stage biotechnology company with a limited operating history, and due to its significant research and development expenditures, the Company has generated operating losses since its inception and has not generated any revenue from the commercial sale of any products. There can be no assurance that profitable operations will ever be achieved, and, if achieved, whether profitability can be sustained on a continuing basis. 
 Since its inception and through March 31, 2024, the Company has funded our operations by raising an aggregate of approximately billion of gross proceeds from the sale and issuance of convertible preferred stock and common stock, pre-funded warrants, the collection of grant proceeds, and the licensing of its product rights for commercialization of pegzilarginase in Europe and certain countries in the Middle East. As of March 31, 2024, Spyre had an accumulated deficit of million, and cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash of million. 
 Based on current operating plans, the Company has sufficient resources to fund operations for at least one year from the issuance date of these financial statements with existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Spyre will need to secure additional financing in the future to fund additional research and development, and before a commercial drug can be produced, marketed and sold. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing or generate license or product revenue, the lack of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 Unaudited Interim Financial Information 
 The interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature that are necessary for a fair statement of the Company s financial position as of March 31, 2024, and its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, changes in convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for any other future annual or interim period. The December 31, 2023 balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "Annual Report") as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024 and amended on March 1, 2024 and November 18, 2024.

of the then outstanding shares of the Company s Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis, during the term of the Paragon Agreement (the "Parapyre Option Obligation"). The Company determined that the 2023 and 2024 grants are two separate grants, as there would be no obligation for the 2024 grant had the Company exercised or terminated all of the options under the Paragon Agreement prior to December 31, 2023. The service inception period for the grant precedes the grant date, with the full award being vested as of the grant date with no post-grant date service requirement. Accordingly, a liability related to the Parapyre Option Obligation is recorded pursuant to the Paragon Agreement during interim periods. On December 31, 2023, the Company settled its 2023 obligation under the Parapyre Option Obligation by issuing Parapyre warrants to purchase the Company's Common Stock, with a per share exercise price for each warrant. 
 The Parapyre Option Obligation is considered a Level 2 liability based on observable market data for substantially the full term of the liability. The Parapyre Option Obligation is measured each period using a Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of the option grant. Changes in the fair value of the Parapyre Option Obligation are recorded as stock-based compensation within Research and development expenses for non-employees who provided pre-clinical development services. 
 CVR Liability 
 In connection with the Asset Acquisition, a non-transferable CVR was distributed to the Legacy Stockholders, but was not distributed to holders of shares of Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock issued to the June 2023 Investors or former stockholders of Pre-Merger Spyre in connection with the Transactions. Holders of the CVR will be entitled to receive certain cash payments from proceeds received by the Company for a period, if any, related to the disposition or monetization of the Company s legacy assets for a period of following the closing of the Asset Acquisition. 
 The CVR liability value is based on significant inputs not observable in the market such as estimated cash flows, estimated probabilities of success, and risk-adjusted discount rates, which represent a Level 3 liability. 
 The fair value of the CVR liability was determined using the probability weighted discounted cash flow method to estimate future cash flows associated with the sale of the legacy assets. Analogous to a dividend being declared/approved in one period and paid out in another, the liability was recorded at the date of approval, June 22, 2023, as a Common Stock dividend, returning capital to the Legacy Stockholders. Changes in fair value of the liability will be recognized as a component of Other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in each reporting period. The liability value is based on significant inputs not observable in the market such as estimated cash flows, estimated probabilities of regulatory success, and discount rates, which represent a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.

 The Company evaluated its securities for credit losses and considered the decline in market value to be primarily attributable to current economic and market conditions and not to a credit loss or other factors. Additionally, the Company does not intend to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position and does not expect it will be required to sell the securities before recovery of the unamortized cost basis. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, an allowance for credit losses had been recognized. Given the Company's intent and ability to hold such securities until recovery, and the lack of significant change in credit risk of these investments, the Company does consider these marketable securities to be impaired as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits. Accounts at each of our U.S. banking institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC up to per depositor. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash deposits at the Company's U.S. banking institutions exceeded the FDIC limits. Uninsured foreign cash deposits were immaterial for both periods. 
 There were realized gains or losses on marketable securities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Interest on marketable securities is included in interest income. Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was million and million, respectively.

 The Company may sell investments at any time for use in current operations even if they have not yet reached maturity. As a result, the Company classifies marketable securities, including securities with maturities beyond twelve months as current assets.

 of the Company's capital stock through their respective holdings of the Company's Common Stock. Fairmount Funds Management LLC ("Fairmount") beneficially owns more than of the Company's capital stock on an as-converted basis, has seats on the Company's board of directors (the "Board") and beneficially owns more than of Paragon, which is a joint venture between Fairmount and FairJourney Biologics. Fairmount appointed Paragon's board of directors and has the contractual right to approve the appointment of any executive officers. Parapyre is an entity formed by Paragon as a vehicle to hold equity in Spyre in order to share profits with certain employees of Paragon. 
 In connection with the Asset Acquisition, the Company assumed the rights and obligations of Pre-Merger Spyre under the Paragon Agreement. Under the Paragon Agreement, Spyre is obligated to compensate Paragon for its services performed under each research program based on the actual costs incurred with mark-up costs pursuant to the terms of the Paragon Agreement. Spyre is also obligated under the Paragon Agreement to issue Parapyre annual equity grants of warrants in accordance with the Parapyre Option Obligation. 
 For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized expenses related to services provided by Paragon subsequent to the Asset Acquisition totaling million, which included million of stock-based compensation expense, and were recorded as Research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, was unpaid and was included in Related party accounts payable and other current liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 
 For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company made payments totaling million to Paragon. 
 On July 12, 2023 and December 14, 2023, the Company exercised the option to license certain intellectual property rights (collectively, the "Option") available under the Paragon Agreement with respect to the SPY001 and SPY002 research programs, respectively, and expects to enter into a SPY001 license agreement (the "SPY001 License Agreement") and a SPY002 license agreement (the "SPY002 License Agreement"). Our Option available under the Paragon Agreement with respect to the SPY003 and SPY004 programs remains unexercised. 
 Following the execution of each of the SPY001 License Agreement and SPY002 License Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay Paragon up to million upon the achievement of specific development, regulatory and clinical milestones for the first product under each agreement, respectively, that achieves such specified milestones. Upon execution of each of the SPY001 License Agreement and the SPY002 License Agreement, we expect to pay Paragon a million fee for nomination of a development candidate, as applicable, and the Company expects to be obligated to make a further milestone payment of million upon the first dosing of a human subject in a Phase 1 trial. With respect to the SPY002 License Agreement only, on a product by product basis, the Company expects to pay Paragon sublicensing fees of up to approximately million upon the achievement of mostly commercial milestones.

 Pursuant to the Paragon Agreement, the Company agreed to issue Parapyre an annual equity grant of warrants, on the last business day of each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, to purchase of the then outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis, during the term of the Paragon Agreement

 Mark McKenna Option Grant 
 On February 1, 2024, the Board appointed Mark McKenna as a Class I director.

 million in upfront cash proceeds and up to million in contingent milestone payments. The sale of pegzilarginase to Immedica superseded and terminated the Immedica Agreement. 
 The milestone payments are contingent on formal reimbursement decisions by national authorities in key European markets and pegzilarginase approval by the FDA, among other events. The upfront payment and contingent milestone payments if paid, net of expenses and adjustments, will be distributed to holders of the Company's CVRs (as defined in Note 1) pursuant to the contingent value rights agreement we entered into with Equiniti Trust Company LLC (f/k/a American Stock Transfer Trust Company LLC) as rights agent in connection with the Asset Acquisition.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 At the time the Company filed the Original Filing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2024. Subsequent to the Original Filing and in connection with this Amendment, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer reevaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and identified a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as the Company did not design and maintain effective controls related to the earnings per share calculation. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Specifically, subsequent to the Original Filing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024 as the Company did not design and maintain effective controls related to the earnings per share calculation, as there was not an effectively designed control in place to evaluate the treatment of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock for the purpose of calculating earnings per share under the two-class method. The material weakness resulted in the restatement of the Company s previously filed consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as the quarterly condensed consolidated financial information for the 2024 interim periods ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024 related to earnings per share. Additionally, the material weakness could result in further misstatements of the earnings per share calculation that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 Notwithstanding the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, our management, including our principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, have concluded that our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of our operations and our cash flows for the periods presented in this Quarterly Report, in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 
 Remediation Plan 
 Our remediation process includes, but is not limited to, enhancing the design of the control relevant to the calculation of net earnings (loss) per share calculations and disclosures to ensure that economic substance beyond the legal form of our capital structure is considered when calculating net earnings (loss) per share. We believe that these actions will remediate the material weakness. The material weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate, and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
