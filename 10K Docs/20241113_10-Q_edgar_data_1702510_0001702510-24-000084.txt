 The Company generally uses the following framework when determining the fair value of investments that are categorized as Level 3: 
 Investments in debt securities are initially evaluated to determine whether the enterprise value of the portfolio company is greater than the applicable debt. The enterprise value of the portfolio company is estimated using a market approach and an income approach. The market approach utilizes market value (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The Investment Adviser carefully considers numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose multiples are used to value the Company s portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. The income approach typically uses a discounted cash flow analysis of the portfolio company. 
 Investments in debt securities that do not have sufficient coverage through the enterprise value analysis are valued based on an expected probability of default and discount recovery analysis. 
 Investments in debt securities with sufficient coverage through the enterprise value analysis are generally valued using a discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying security. Projected cash flows in the discounted cash flow typically represent the relevant security s contractual interest, fees and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the security s expected maturity date. The discount rate to be used is determined using an average of two market-based methodologies. Investments in debt securities may also be valued using consensus pricing. 
 Investments in equities are generally valued using a market approach and/or an income approach. The market approach utilizes market value (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The income approach typically uses a discounted cash flow analysis of the portfolio company.

 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s investments in first and second lien debt securities are discount rates, indicative quotes and comparable EBITDA multiples. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s investments in equities are discount rates and comparable EBITDA multiples. Significant increases in discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Significant decreases in indicative quotes or comparable EBITDA multiples in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. 
 Financial instruments disclosed but not carried at fair value 
 The carrying values of the secured borrowings generally approximate their respective fair values due to their variable interest rates. Secured borrowings are categorized as Level 3 within the hierarchy. The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair value based on the short term nature of these items.

 , conditional upon stockholders approval of the proposal to convert the Company to a perpetual life BDC as discussed above. On January 21, 2022, stockholders approved the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, which the Company entered into effective as of the date of such approval. 
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement effective as of January 21, 2022, and subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Directors, the Investment Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Company. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives fees from the Company consisting of components a management fee and an incentive fee. 
 From the period September 12, 2021 until January 21, 2022, the management fee was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of of the Company s average Capital Under Management (as defined below) at the end of the then-current quarter and the prior calendar quarter. Capital Under Management means cumulative capital called, less cumulative distributions categorized as Returned Capital. Returned Capital means unused capital commitments increased by the aggregate amount of (i) any portion of distributions made by the Company to an investor during the Original Investment Period (as defined below) which represents (A) proceeds realized from the sale or repayment of any investment (as opposed to investment income) during the Investment Period (but not in excess of the cost of any such investment) or (B) a return of such investor s capital contributions to the Company, as determined by the Board of Directors, and (ii) any amount drawn down by the Company from unused capital commitments to pay management fees, incentive fees, organizational expenses or Company expenses, to the extent such investor receives subsequent distributions. For the avoidance of doubt, Capital Under Management does not include capital acquired through the use of leverage, and Returned Capital does not include distributions of the Company s investment income (i.e., proceeds received in respect of interest payments, dividends or fees, net of expenses) or net realized capital gains to the investors. 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement until January 21, 2022, the incentive fee consisted of parts. The first part was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equaled of pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a preferred return of per quarter annualized), or hurdle rate, and a catch-up feature.

 Carlyle Credit Solutions, Inc., a Maryland corporation is a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act and have operated our business as a BDC since we began our investment activities. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a registered investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Code ). We were incorporated in February 2017. We conducted the Initial Private Offering and intend to conduct the New Continuous Offering of our shares of common stock to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We have an indefinite term. Our principal executive offices are located at One Vanderbilt Avenue, Suite 3400, New York, New York 10017. 
 Our investment objective is to generate attractive risk adjusted returns and current income primarily through assembling a portfolio of senior secured term loans to U.S. middle market companies in which private equity sponsors hold, directly or indirectly, a financial interest in the form of debt and/or equity. Our core investment strategy focuses on lending to U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies with approximately 25 million to 100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), supported by financial sponsors. This core strategy is opportunistically supplemented with differentiated and complementary lending and investing strategies, which take advantage of the broad capabilities of Carlyle's Global Credit platform while offering risk-diversifying portfolio benefits. We seek to achieve our investment objective primarily through direct origination of secured debt instruments, including first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans, first lien/last out loans and unitranche loans) and second lien senior secured loans (collectively, Middle Market Senior Loans ), with a minority of our assets invested in investments that are typically higher yielding than Middle Market Senior Loans (which may include unsecured debt, mezzanine debt and investments in equities and structured products). The Middle Market Senior Loans are generally made to private U.S. middle market companies that are, in many cases, controlled by private equity firms.

Table o f Contents 

 We invest primarily in loans to middle market companies whose debt is rated below investment grade, or would likely be rated below investment grade if it was rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominately speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. 
 We are externally managed by our Investment Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Investment Company Act and a subsidiary of Carlyle. We benefit from our Investment Adviser s investment team of over 200 investment professionals with the deep knowledge and expertise across multiple asset classes who are supported by a team of finance, operations and administrative professionals currently employed by Carlyle Employee Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Carlyle. In conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale, relationships and resources of Carlyle, including our Investment Adviser and its affiliates. 
 Third Quarter 2024 Highlights 
 Quarterly Results 
 Net investment income was 31.0 million or 0.58 per share. 
 During the quarter, total dividends declared were 0.51 per share or 27.1 million. 
 Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 declined from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in the size of our portfolio. 
 The NAV per share was 19.76 as of September 30, 2024 and 19.76 as of June 30, 2024, as the net investment income in excess of our dividends was offset by the net unrealized depreciation on the portfolio. 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 161 investments across 120 portfolio companies and 25 industries for a total fair value of 1.7 billion.

 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 As a BDC, we believe that the key components of our results of operations for our business are earnings per share, dividends declared, net investment income and net asset value per share. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded basic and diluted earnings per share of 0.50, declared dividends per share of 0.51 and earned 0.58 of net investment income per share. 
 The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data):

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our NAV per share was 19.76 and 19.60, respectively. 
 Investment Income 
 We generate investment income primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and debt and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and generally bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as SOFR. Interest on these debt investments is generally paid quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. At times, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate investment income in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include: (i) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to our Investment Adviser pursuant to the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; (iii) costs and other expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by our Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement between us and our Administrator (the Administration Agreement and (iv) other operating expenses summarized below:

 Portfolio Credit 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk assessment policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments and rates each of them based on the following categories, which we refer to as Internal Risk Ratings . Key drivers of internal risk ratings include financial metrics, financial covenants, liquidity and enterprise value coverage. Pursuant to these risk policies, an Internal Risk Rating of 1 5, which are defined below, is assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. 
 60 

Table o f Contents 

 Rating Definition 1 Borrower is operating above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 
 2 Borrower is operating generally as expected or at an acceptable level of performance. The level of risk to our initial cost basis is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination. This is the initial risk rating assigned to all new borrowers. 
 3 Borrower is operating below expectations and level of risk to our cost basis has increased since the time of origination. The borrower may be out of compliance with debt covenants. Payments are generally current although there may be higher risk of payment default. 
 4 Borrower is operating materially below expectations and the loan s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due, but generally not by more than 120 days. It is anticipated that we may not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 
 5 Borrower is operating substantially below expectations and the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. It is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 
 
 Our Investment Adviser monitors and, when appropriate, changes the risk ratings assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. Our Investment Adviser reviews our investment ratings in connection with our quarterly valuation process. The below table summarizes the Internal Risk Ratings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 
 The following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the three month periods ending September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Three Months Ended Change September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Investment income: Interest income 48,453 51,044 (2,591) PIK income 5,246 4,307 939 Other income 898 923 (25) Total investment income 54,597 56,274 (1,677) Expenses: Base management fees 2,569 2,505 64 Incentive fees 4,434 4,509 (75) Professional fees 263 441 (178) Administrative service fees 568 500 68 Interest expense and credit facility fees 14,460 15,635 (1,175) Directors fees and expenses 79 83 (4) Other general and administrative 784 553 231 Excise tax expense 410 460 (50) Total expenses 23,567 24,686 (1,119) Net investment income (loss) 31,030 31,588 (558) Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation): Net realized gain (loss) on investments (1,052) (1,772) 720 Net realized currency gain (loss) on non-investment assets and liabilities 229 (70) 299 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (137) (5,833) 5,696 Net change in unrealized currency gains (losses) on non-investment assets and liabilities (3,211) 276 (3,487) Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and non-investment assets and liabilities (4,171) (7,399) 3,228 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations 26,859 24,189 2,670 
 Investment Income 
 The decrease in investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in average investment balances. As of September 30, 2024, the size of our portfolio decreased to 1,722,795 from 1,737,333 as of June 30, 2024, at amortized cost. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the weighted average yield of our total debt and income producing investments was 11.8 and 12.4 , respectively, based on amortized cost. 
 Interest income and PIK income on our first and second lien debt investments are dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, we expect the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan s credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024, two of our debt investments were on non-accrual status at a fair value of 9,203, which represented approximately 0.5 of total investments at fair value. As of June 30, 2024, two of our debt investments were on non-accrual status at a fair value of 10,922, which represented approximately 0.6 of total investments at fair value. 
 Expenses 
 The decrease in interest expense and credit facility fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 was driven by lower weighted average borrowings outstanding. 
 The increase in base management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 was driven by an increase in our net asset value. 
 64 

Table o f Contents 

 The decrease in incentive fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 was driven by lower pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no accrued capital gains incentive fees based upon the cumulative net realized and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of September 30, 2024. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. See Note 4, Related Party Transactions, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the incentive and management fees. 
 Professional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and their respective staff. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs. 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 The amount of and number of investments with realized gain (loss) and change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Realized gains on investments 1,580 86 Number of investments with realized gains 4 3 Realized losses on investments (2,632) (1,858) Number of investments with realized losses 1 3 Change in unrealized appreciation on investments 12,618 11,752 Number of investments with unrealized appreciation 73 62 Change in unrealized depreciation on investments (12,755) (17,585) Number of investments with unrealized depreciation 92 91 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a realized loss due to the sale of our investment in Stonegate Pub Company Bidco Limited partially offset by a realized gain from the sale of our equity investment in Chartis Holding, LLC. 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is driven by changes in other inputs utilized under our valuation methodology, including, but not limited to, enterprise value multiples, borrower leverage multiples and borrower ratings, and the impact of exits.

 Investment Income 
 The decrease in investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by a decrease in interest income. As of September 30, 2024, the size of our portfolio decreased to 1,722,795 from 1,912,035 as of September 30, 2023, at amortized cost. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the weighted average yield of our total debt and income producing investments was 11.8 and 12.5 , respectively, based on amortized cost. 
 Interest and PIK income on our first and second lien debt investments are dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, we expect the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan s credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, two and three of our debt investments were on non-accrual status, respectively. Non-accrual investments had a fair value of 9,203 and 8,855, which represented 0.5 and 0.5 of total investments at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The remaining first and second lien debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

 Expenses 
 The decrease in interest expense and credit facility fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by a lower weighted average debt balance. 
 The decrease in incentive fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by lower pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
 The decrease in base management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by lower average net assets as a result of net repayments on our investments. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no accrued capital gains incentive fees based upon the cumulative net realized and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of September 30, 2024. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under U.S. GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. See Note 4, Related Party Transactions, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the incentive and management fees. 
 Professional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and their respective staff. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs. 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 The amount of and number of investments with realized gain (loss) and changes in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Realized gains on investments 1,580 22 5,678 1,263 Number of investments with realized gains 4 6 9 10 Realized losses on investments (2,632) 275 (48,860) 1,475 Number of investments with realized losses 1 2 5 5 Change in unrealized appreciation on investments 12,618 17,201 68,042 48,145 Number of investments with unrealized appreciation 73 100 93 114 Change in unrealized depreciation on investments (12,755) 16,784 (30,098) 78,259 Number of investments with unrealized depreciation 92 51 91 56 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a realized loss after the write-off of our investment in American Physician Partners, partially offset by a realized gain from the recapitalization of our investment in Dermatology Associates. The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly driven by the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation (depreciation). 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is driven by changes in other inputs utilized under our valuation methodology, including, but not limited to, enterprise value multiples, borrower leverage multiples and borrower ratings, and the impact of exits. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Capitalization 
 We have capitalized our business to date primarily through the issuance and sale of our common stock and asset-level financing. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings under the Credit Facilities, as well as through 
 67 

Table o f Contents 

 securitization of a portion of our existing investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had 664,312 of outstanding consolidated indebtedness under the Credit Facilities, as previously discussed within Portfolio and Investment Activity - Portfolio Financing . As of September 30, 2024, we had 259,288 of liquidity that can be used to satisfy our short-term cash requirements and working capital for our business. Refer to Note 5, Borrowings, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our financing. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net financial leverage was 0.61x and 0.66x, respectively. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our Credit Facilities. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 65,586 65,755 Available borrowings under Credit Facilities 193,702 226,028 Total Liquidity 259,288 291,783 
 We generate cash from the net proceeds of offerings of our common stock and through cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, as well as income earned on investments and cash equivalents. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings under our credit facilities, the issuance of debt, and through securitization of a portion of our existing investments. The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for investments in portfolio companies, repayment of indebtedness, cash distributions to our stockholders, the repurchase of our shares through the Quarterly Tender Offer, and for other general corporate purposes. We believe our current cash position, available capacity on our credit facilities, which is well in excess of our unfunded commitments, and net cash provided by operating activities will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our obligations and continue to support our investment objectives, including reserving for the capital needs which may arise at our portfolio companies. 
 Liquidity Needs 
 Our primary liquidity needs include our funding of new and existing portfolio investments, payment of operating expenses and interest and principal payments under the Credit Facilities. We also repurchase our shares through the Quarterly Tender Offers. 
 Contractual Obligations and Contingencies 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into contracts or agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could occur which may give rise to liabilities arising from these provisions against us. We believe that the likelihood of such an event is remote; however, the maximum potential exposure is unknown. No accrual has been made in the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of September 30, 2024 and the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 for any such exposure. 
 We have in the past, currently are and may in the future become obligated to fund commitments such as revolving credit facilities, bridge financing commitments, or delayed draw commitments. We had the following unfunded commitments to fund delayed draw and revolving senior secured loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 Par / Principal Amount as of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Unfunded delayed draw commitments 104,622 75,501 Unfunded revolving commitments 60,686 63,465 Total unfunded commitments 165,308 138,966

 Cash Flows 
 The following table details the net change in our cash and cash equivalents: 
 For the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities 242,144 Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities (242,313) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (169) 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 233,257 related to cost of investments purchased and received 401,134 in repayments on our investments. Net borrowings on our Credit Facilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 92,166. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 3,419,279 shares for an aggregate offering price of approximately 67,162 and repurchased and extinguished 6,535,860 shares for an aggregate purchase price of 128,795. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. There have been no material changes in the critical accounting estimates since those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in the valuations of our investment portfolio and interest rates. 
 Valuation Risk 
 Our investments generally do not have a readily available market price. Our Investment Adviser, as the valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, values our investments for which market quotations are not readily available in good faith at fair value in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. In addition, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is possible that the difference could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, on a fair value basis, approximately 99.8 of our debt investments bear interest at a floating rate, which primarily are subject to interest rate floors. The Credit Facilities are subject to floating interest rates and are primarily paid based on floating SOFR rates. 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. There can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our income in the future. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income, should interest rates increase or decrease by 100, 200 or 300 basis points. These hypothetical interest income calculations are based on a model of the settled debt investments in our portfolio held as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates and the impact of that change on interest income. Interest expense is calculated based on outstanding secured borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and based on the terms 
 69 

Table o f Contents 

 of our Credit Facilities. Interest expense on our Credit Facilities is calculated using the stated interest rate as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, adjusted for the hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below. We intend to continue to finance a portion of our investments with borrowings and the interest rates paid on our borrowings may significantly impact our net interest income. 
 We regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates for our settled debt investments (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) and outstanding secured borrowings assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Basis Point Change Interest Income Interest Expense Net Investment Income Interest Income Interest Expense Net Investment Income Up 300 basis points 49,731 (19,929) 29,802 53,741 (22,642) 31,099 Up 200 basis points 33,154 (13,286) 19,868 35,827 (15,095) 20,732 Up 100 basis points 16,577 (6,643) 9,934 17,914 (7,547) 10,367 Down 100 basis points (16,577) 6,643 (9,934) (17,914) 7,547 (10,367) Down 200 basis points (33,154) 13,286 (19,868) (35,827) 15,095 (20,732) Down 300 basis points (49,662) 19,929 (29,733) (53,712) 22,642 (31,070) 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them of material information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company may become party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. The Company is not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against the Company. See also Note 9, Litigation, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth within this Form 10-Q, consideration should be given to the information disclosed in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Except as previously reported by the Company on a Current Report on Form 8-K, we did not sell any equity securities during the period covered in this report that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 Share Repurchases 
 In the second quarter of 2022, we commenced a quarterly liquidity program pursuant to which we expect to conduct quarterly tender offers (the Quarterly Tender Offer to repurchase up to 3.5 of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately prior to the quarter in which the Quarterly Tender Offer is conducted, at a per share price equal to the net asset value per share as of the last day of the quarter in which the Quarterly Tender Offer is conducted, less an early repurchase fee of 2 of the net asset value of such shares in the case of shares that have an initial issue date within the one year period prior to the valuation date associated with such Quarterly Tender Offer. However, the Board of Directors has the discretion to determine whether or not we will purchase common stock from stockholders, and we are not required to conduct tender offers on a quarterly basis or at all. If during any consecutive 24-month period, we do not engage in a quarterly tender offer in which we accept for purchase 100 of properly tendered shares (a Qualifying Tender ), we will not make commitments for new portfolio investments (excluding short-term cash management investments under 30 days in duration) and will reserve available assets to satisfy future tender requests until a Qualifying Tender occurs, subject to our continuing to use available funds and liquidity for certain purposes. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, upon completion of our tender offer that commenced June 28, 2024, we repurchased 789,019 shares for a purchase price 19.76 of per share, or approximately 15.6 million in aggregate. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or Section 16 officer of the Company or any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements (in each case, as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K).

The Contributor shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement, take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if this Agreement were deemed to create a security interest in the Contributed Collateral Obligations, such security interest would be deemed to be a perfected security interest of first priority (subject only to customary permitted liens) under applicable law and will be maintained as such throughout the term of this Agreement. The Contributee shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies which it may have under this Agreement, all other rights and remedies provided to a secured creditor under the UCC and other applicable law, which rights and remedies shall be cumulative.

The Contributor agrees to reflect in the Contributor s financial records and to include a note in the publicly filed annual and quarterly financial statements of the Contributor indicating that (i) assets related to transactions that do not meet GAAP requirements for accounting sale treatment are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of the Contributor within the investments line and are disclosed in the Contributor s schedule of investments, and (ii) those assets are owned by a special purpose entity that is consolidated in the financial statements of the Contributor, and the creditors of that special purpose entity have received ownership and or security interests in such assets and such assets are not intended to be available to the creditors of the Contributor (or any affiliate of the Contributor other than the Contributee) of such assets to that special purpose entity.

 Section I.5 Treatment of Transfer Backup Grant of Security Interest . (a) Each party hereto (i) agrees that each Transfer shall be a contribution for all relevant purposes and (ii) intends, and has as its business objective, that each Transfer be an absolute transfer and not be a transfer as security for a loan.

In their capacities as Transferor and Transferee under this Agreement, neither party is a trustee or agent for the other party, nor does either party have any fiduciary obligations to the other party. This Agreement shall not be construed to create a partnership or joint venture between the parties hereto. 
 (a) If, notwithstanding such intention, any Transfer is characterized by a court of competent jurisdiction as a transfer as security for a loan rather than a contribution, or any 
 19 

Transfer shall for any reason be ineffective to transfer to the Transferee all of the Transferor s right, title and interest in the Participation Interest in any Contributor Participation (including the Income Collections thereon), then the Transferor shall be deemed to have granted to the Transferee, and the Transferor hereby grants to the Transferee, a security interest in and lien on all of the Transferor s right, title and interest in and to such Contributor Participation (including the Participation Interests therein and the Income Collections thereon), whether now existing or hereafter acquired, in order to secure such loan and all other obligations of the Transferor hereunder. For such purposes, this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under the UCC, to secure the prompt and complete payment of a loan deemed to have been made by the Transferee to the Transferor in an amount equal to the aggregate purchase price paid to the Transferor together with such other obligations of the Transferor as may arise hereunder in favor of the Transferee. 
 (b) For so long as the Transferee owns (i) prior to the relevant Elevation Date, a Participation Interest in any Contributor Participation, the Transferee shall record in the Transferee s books and records the fact that the Transferee is the beneficial owner of such Contributor Participation and (ii) after the relevant Elevation Date any Contributor Participation, the Transferee shall record in the Transferee s books and records the fact that the Transferee is the record owner of such Contributor Participation. After the Settlement Date, the Transferor shall record in its books and records the fact that the Transferor is no longer the beneficial owner of such Contributor Participation and, after the relevant Elevation Date with respect to any Contributor Participation, the Transferor shall record in its books and records the fact that the Transferor is no longer the record owner of such Contributor Participation. 
 (c) The Transferor hereby authorizes the Transferee to prepare and file such UCC financing statements, including but not limited to amendment, renewal, continuation or in lieu statements and amendments or supplements thereto or other instruments as the Transferee may from time to time deem necessary or appropriate in order to perfect and maintain the security interests granted hereunder in accordance with the UCC. 
 Section I.6 Accounts and Payments . The Transferor agrees to (a) until the Elevation of each Contributor Participation has been completed, maintain its existing custodial arrangements and bank accounts established to receive proceeds of such Contributor Participation and (b) remit to the Transferee, no more than two (2) Business Days after receipt of such payment, each payment received in connection with each Contributor Participation to which the Transferee is entitled in accordance with Section 1.02 . The Transferor acknowledges that, from and after the Settlement Date, it shall have no equitable or beneficial interest in any payments received by it with respect to any Contributor Participations to which Transferee is entitled in accordance with Section 1.02 . 
 Section I.7 Standard of Care . The Transferor, in its capacity as such, shall not be held to the standard of care of a fiduciary but agrees that, until the Elevation of each Contributor Participation has been completed, it shall exercise the same duty of care in the administration and enforcement of the Participation Interests that it would exercise if it held the Contributor Participations solely for its own account, but in any event, no less than a commercially 
 20 

reasonable standard of care. Except for losses actually incurred by the Transferee that result from the Transferor s bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of any of the express terms and provisions of this Agreement, it shall not be liable for any error in judgment or for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it. The Transferor may rely on any notice, consent, certificate, request or other written document or communication received by the Transferor from the Transferee believed by the Transferor in good faith to be genuine.
