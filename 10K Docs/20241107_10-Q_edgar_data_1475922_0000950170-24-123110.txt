In April 2024, the Company executed agreements providing for the receipt of proceeds for certain claims filed by the Company under a Representation and Warranty insurance policy negotiated and purchased in connection with the acquisition of e-TeleQuote on July 1, 2021. The claims made by the Company involved breaches of certain representations and warranties relating to the pre-acquisition financial statements made by the sellers of e-TeleQuote in connection with the acquisition. The Company recognized a gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of million, which is equal to the aggregate proceeds received from the third-party insurers under the policy in May 2024, reflecting the full coverage under the policy. The Company recognized this gain in Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment revenues as it resulted from a corporate investment decision to purchase the insurance policy. On a consolidated basis, this gain is included in Other, net revenue in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. The Company recorded corporate restructuring charges of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, associated with the decision to exit the Senior Health business, which are included in the determination of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes in the Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment.

All of our AFS mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent beneficial interests in variable interest entities VIEs ). We are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities economic performance. The maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement in these VIEs equals the carrying value of the securities.

Expected maturities may differ from scheduled contractual maturities because issuers of securities may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Trading Securities. 

Held-to-maturity Security. Concurrent with the execution of the Vidalia Re Coinsurance Agreement, Vidalia Re entered into a Surplus Note Purchase Agreement (the Surplus Note Purchase Agreement with Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Hannover Re and a newly formed limited liability company (the LLC owned by a third- party service provider. Under the Surplus Note Purchase Agreement, Vidalia Re issued a surplus note (the Surplus Note to the LLC in exchange for a credit enhanced note from the LLC with an equal principal amount (the LLC Note ). The principal amount of both the LLC Note and the Surplus Note will fluctuate over time to coincide with the amount of reserves contractually supported under the Vidalia Re Coinsurance Agreement. Both the LLC Note and the Surplus Note mature on and bear interest at an annual interest rate of . The LLC Note is guaranteed by Hannover Re through a credit enhancement feature in exchange for a fee, which is reflected in interest expense in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. The LLC is a VIE as its owner does not have an equity investment at risk that is sufficient to permit the LLC to finance its activities without Vidalia Re or Hannover Re. The Parent Company, Primerica Life, and Vidalia Re share the power to direct the activities of the LLC with Hannover Re, but they do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive any residual returns related to the LLC s primary risks or sources of variability. Through the credit enhancement feature, Hannover Re is the ultimate risk taker in this transaction and bears the obligation to absorb the LLC s losses in the event of a Surplus Note default in exchange for the fee. Accordingly, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the LLC and does not consolidate the LLC within its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Hannover Re's financial strength rating by A.M. Best was A+ as of September 30, 2024. The LLC Note is classified as a held-to-maturity debt security in the Company s invested asset portfolio as we have the positive intent and ability to hold the security until maturity. As of September 30, 2024, the LLC Note had an estimated unrealized holding loss of million based on its amortized cost and estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the LLC Note is expected to be at least equal to the estimated fair value of the offsetting Surplus Note. See Note 16 (Debt) for more information on the Surplus Note. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , credit losses have been recognized on the LLC Note. Investments on Deposit with Governmental Authorities. As required by law, we have investments on deposit with governmental authorities and banks for the protection of policyholders. The fair value of investments on deposit was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Securities Lending Transactions. We participate in securities lending transactions with broker-dealers and other financial institutions to increase investment income with minimal risk. We require minimum collateral on securities loaned equal to of the fair value of the loaned securities. We accept collateral in the form of securities, which we are not able to sell or encumber, and to the extent the collateral declines in value below , we require additional collateral from the borrower. Any securities collateral received is not reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. We also accept collateral in the form of cash, all of which we reinvest. For loans involving unrestricted cash collateral, the collateral is reported as an asset with a corresponding liability representing our obligation to return the collateral. We continue to carry the loaned securities as invested assets in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets during the terms of the loans, and we do not report them as sales. Cash collateral received and reinvested was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The amortized cost of AFS securities with a cost basis in excess of their fair values were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , allowance for credit losses was recorded for AFS securities. Substantially all of the unrealized losses were the result of change in market interest rates compared to the date the securities were acquired rather than the credit quality of the securities, and we have no present intention to dispose of them. We recognized million for credit losses on AFS securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. We did t recognize any credit losses on AFS securities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and we recognized million for credit losses on AFS securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. We recognize credit losses on securities due to: (i) our intent to sell them; (ii) adverse credit events indicating that we will not receive the security s contractual cash flows when contractually due, such as news of an impending filing for bankruptcy; (iii) analyses of the issuer s most recent financial statements or other information indicating that significant liquidity deficiencies, significant losses and large declines in capitalization exist; and (iv) analyses of rating agency information for issuances with severe ratings downgrades indicating a significant increase in the possibility of default. Derivatives. We have a deferred loss related to closed forward contracts, which were settled several years ago, that were used to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates that resulted from the net investment in our Canadian operations. The amount of deferred loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was million as of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . These deferred losses will not be recognized until such time as we sell or substantially liquidate our Canadian operations, although we have no such intention.

In estimating fair value of our investments, we use a third-party pricing service for approximately all of our securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The remaining securities are primarily thinly-traded securities, such as private placements, and are valued using models based on observable inputs on public corporate spreads having similar characteristics (e.g., sector, average life and quality rating), liquidity and yield based on quality rating, average life and U.S. Treasury yields. All observable data inputs are corroborated by independent third-party data. We also corroborate pricing information provided by our third-party pricing service by performing a review of selected securities. Our review activities include: obtaining detailed information about the assumptions, inputs and methodologies used in pricing the security; documenting this information; and corroborating it by comparison to independently obtained prices and/or independently developed pricing methodologies. Furthermore, we perform internal reasonableness assessments on fair value determinations within our portfolio throughout the year and as of year-end, including pricing variance analyses and comparisons to alternative pricing sources and benchmark returns. If a fair value appears unusual relative to these assessments, we will re-examine the inputs and may challenge a fair value assessment made by the pricing service. If there is a known pricing error, we will request a reassessment by the pricing service. If the pricing service is unable to perform the reassessment on a timely basis, we will determine the appropriate price by requesting a reassessment from an alternative pricing service or other qualified source as necessary. We do not adjust quotes or prices except in a rare circumstance to resolve a known error. Because many fixed-maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis, third-party pricing services generally determine fair value using industry-standard methodologies, which vary by asset class. For corporates, governments, and agency securities, these methodologies include developing prices by incorporating available market information such as U.S. Treasury curves, benchmarking of similar securities including new issues, sector groupings, quotes from market participants and matrix pricing. Observable information is compiled and integrates relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. Additionally, security prices are periodically back-tested to validate and/or refine models as conditions warrant. Market indicators and industry and economic events are also monitored as triggers to obtain additional data. For certain structured securities (such as mortgage- and asset-backed securities) with limited trading activity, third-party pricing services generally use industry-standard pricing methodologies that incorporate market information, such as index prices or discounting expected future cash flows based on underlying collateral, and quotes from market participants, to estimate fair value. If one or more of these input measures are not deemed observable for a particular security, the security will be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Where specific market information is unavailable for certain securities, pricing models produce estimates of fair value primarily using Level 2 inputs along with certain Level 3 inputs. These models include matrix pricing. The pricing matrix uses current U.S. Treasury rates and credit spreads received from third-party sources to estimate fair value. The credit spreads incorporate the issuer s industry- or issuer-specific credit characteristics and the security s time to maturity, if warranted. Remaining unpriced securities are valued using an estimate of fair value based on indicative market prices that include significant unobservable inputs not based on, nor corroborated by, market information, including the utilization of non-binding broker quotes.

We obtain independent pricing quotes based on observable inputs as of the end of the reporting period for all securities in Level 2. Those inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, market bids/offers, quoted prices for similar instruments in markets that are not active, and other relevant data. We monitor these inputs for market indicators, industry and economic events. There were material transfers between Level 1 and Level 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The fair values of financial instruments presented above are estimates of the fair values at a specific point in time using various sources and methods, including market quotations and a complex matrix system that takes into account issuer sector, quality, and spreads in the current marketplace. Financial Instruments Recognized at Fair Value in the Balance Sheets. Estimated fair values of investments in AFS securities are principally a function of current spreads and interest rates that are corroborated by independent third-party data. Therefore, the fair values presented are indicative of amounts we could realize or settle at the respective balance sheet date. We do not necessarily intend to dispose of or liquidate such instruments prior to maturity. Trading securities and equity securities, including common and nonredeemable preferred stocks, are carried at fair value. Segregated funds in separate accounts are carried at the underlying value of the variable insurance contracts, which is fair value. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accrued investment income, accounts payable, cash collateral and payables for security transactions approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Consequently, such financial instruments are not included in the above table.

We estimate and recognize lifetime expected credit losses for reinsurance recoverables. In estimating the allowance for credit losses for reinsurance recoverables, we factor in the underlying collateral for reinsurance agreements where available. Specifically, for reinsurers with underlying trust assets, we compare the reinsurance recoverables balance to the underlying trust assets that mitigate the potential exposure to credit losses. We also analyze the financial condition of the reinsurers, as determined by third-party rating agencies, to determine the probability of default for the reinsurers. We then utilize a third-party credit default study to calculate an expected credit loss given default rate or recovery rate. The probability of default and loss given default rates are then applied to the reinsurers recoverable balance, while also factoring in any third-party letters of credit that support the reinsurance agreement, in order to calculate our allowance for credit losses.

The cash surrender value represents the amount of the contract holders account balance distributable at the balance sheet date less the Company s estimate of the deferred sales charges that would be assessed if the policyholders redeemed their contracts at the balance sheet date. This estimate requires the Company to make certain assumptions regarding the underlying account balances by contribution year and application of the contractually defined deferred sales charges that would be applicable to each contribution year.

million, net of reinsurance, primarily due to the reduction of the expected cost of waiver of premium benefits. The adjustment resulting from the assumption change was recognized as a remeasurement gain in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The waiver of premium benefit offered for our term life insurance product is an optional supplemental rider that waives the policyholder s insurance premiums during a qualifying disability. Lower than expected disability incidence rates have consistently been observed each year since the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike our mortality or lapse rates, which had both favorable and unfavorable experience in the years since the onset of the pandemic, the disability incidence rates declined in 2020 and have remained at similar levels since then. Therefore, we have partially reflected this improvement in recognizing our best estimate assumption in determining our LFPB. Waiver of premium benefits are not reinsured on a yearly renewal term basis, therefore, most of the impact of this assumption change is reflected in the future policy benefits remeasurement gain line item in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. In our recent experience, we continue to observe lower mortality and higher lapses compared to the updated actuarial assumptions in our Term Life Insurance segment. However, we believe the majority of these variances are likely temporary and experience will return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels in the future. Slight changes were made to the mortality assumption that included rolling the mortality improvement forward one calendar year. The early duration lapse rate assumption was also increased to partially reflect recent experience. The LFPB impact, net of reinsurance, for both the mortality and lapse assumption changes was de minimus. We also performed our annual review of LFPB assumptions for our closed block of non-term life insurance included in the Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment. Based on this review, we recognized a remeasurement loss of approximately million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Discount rates, while a material assumption to our LFPB, are not part of the assumption-setting process since they are updated quarterly based on observable rates. There have been no changes with the compilation of data sources used for this input. Losses recognized as a result of capping the net premium ratio at were immaterial during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Equity awards expense deferred 

On February 16, 2024, the Compensation Committee of our Board granted the following equity awards to employees as part of the annual approval of management incentive compensation: RSUs awarded to management with a measurement-date fair value of per unit that have time-based vesting requirements with equal and annual graded vesting over approximately subsequent to the grant date. 

 PSUs awarded to our five top executives as of that date with a measurement-date fair value of per unit. The PSUs will be earned on March 1, 2027 contingent upon the Company achieving a targeted annual average return on adjusted equity ROAE and average EPS growth for the period from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026. The actual number of common shares that will be earned will vary based on the actual ROAE and average EPS growth relative to the targeted ROAE and average EPS growth and can range from to shares. 

 All awards granted to employees on February 16, 2024 vest upon voluntary termination of employment by any employee who is retirement eligible as of his or her termination date. The substantive conditions in order to be retirement eligible require that an employee must be at least 55 years old and his or her age plus years of service with the Company must equal at least 75. The number of PSUs that will ultimately be earned for a retirement eligible employee is equal to the amount calculated using the Company s actual cumulative three-year ROAE and average EPS growth for the performance period even if that employee retires prior to the completion of such relevant three-year performance period.

Business Overview 
 We are a leading provider of financial products and services to middle-income households in the United States and Canada primarily through a network of independent contractor sales representatives independent sales representatives or independent sales force ). We assist our clients in meeting their needs for term life insurance, which we underwrite, and mutual funds, annuities, managed investments, and other financial products, which we distribute primarily on behalf of third parties. We have two primary operating segments, Term Life Insurance and Investment and Savings Products, and a third segment, Corporate and Other Distributed Products. 
 The Company previously reported a Senior Health segment, which consisted of e-TeleQuote Insurance, Inc. and subsidiaries, a marketer of Medicare-related insurance products underwritten by third-party health insurance carriers to eligible Medicare beneficiaries (the Senior Health business that was disposed of as of September 30, 2024, and is now reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Refer to Note 2 (Discontinued Operations) to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details. 
 Term Life Insurance. We distribute the term life insurance products that we underwrite through our three issuing life insurance company subsidiaries: Primerica Life Insurance Company Primerica Life ), National Benefit Life Insurance Company NBLIC ), and Primerica Life Insurance Company of Canada Primerica Life Canada ). Policies remain in-force until the expiration of the coverage period or until the policyholder ceases to make premium payments. Our in-force term life insurance policies have level premiums for the stated term period. As such, the policyholder pays the same amount each year. Initial policy term periods are between 10 and 35 years. While premiums typically remain level during the initial term period, our claim obligations generally increase as our policyholders age. In addition, we incur significant up-front costs in acquiring new insurance business. 
 Investment and Savings Products. In the United States, we distribute mutual funds, managed investments, variable annuity, and fixed annuity products of several third-party companies. We provide investment advisory and administrative services for client assets invested in our managed investments program. We also perform distinct transfer agent recordkeeping services and non-bank custodial services for investors purchasing certain mutual funds we distribute. In Canada, we offer mutual funds of other companies and segregated funds, which are underwritten by Primerica Life Canada. 
 Corporate and Other Distributed Products. The Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment consists primarily of revenues and expenses related to other distributed products, including closed blocks of various insurance products underwritten by NBLIC, prepaid legal services, mortgage originations, and other financial products. These products, except for closed blocks of various insurance products underwritten by NBLIC, are distributed pursuant to distribution arrangements with third-party companies through the independent sales force. Net investment income earned on cash, cash equivalents, and our invested asset portfolio is recorded in the Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment. Interest expense incurred by the Company is attributed to the Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment. 
 Business Trends and Conditions 
 The relative strength and stability of the financial markets and economies in the United States and Canada affect our growth and profitability. Our business is, and we expect will continue to be, influenced by a number of industry-wide and product-specific trends 
 29 

and conditions. Economic conditions, including unemployment levels and consumer confidence, influence investment and spending decisions by middle-income consumers, who are generally our primary clients. These conditions and factors also impact prospective recruits perceptions of the business opportunity that becoming an independent sales representative offers, which can drive or dampen recruiting. Consumer spending and borrowing levels affect how consumers evaluate their savings and debt management plans. In addition, equity market returns and interest rates impact consumer demand for the investment and savings products we distribute. Our customers perception of the strength of the capital markets may also influence their decisions to invest in the investment and savings products we distribute. 
 The financial and distribution results of our operations in Canada, as reported in U.S. dollars, are affected by changes in the currency exchange rate. As a result, changes in the Canadian dollar exchange rate may significantly affect the results of our business for all amounts translated and reported in U.S. dollars. 
 Volatility in capital markets in recent periods has continued to impact our business. Strong equity market performance has influenced product sales and client asset values that drive revenue in the Investment and Savings Products segment. In addition, the sharp rise in market interest rates during 2022 has largely driven the unrealized losses that have accumulated in our investment portfolio. We have not recognized losses caused by interest rate volatility in the income statement for securities where we have no present intention to dispose of them and we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity or a market price recovery. Elevated interest rates have also led to increases in net investment income as we are able to earn higher returns on our new debt securities purchases and cash balances. 
 Significant inflation that followed the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an elevated cost of living for middle-income families. We believe that the higher cost of living has adversely impacted persistency for term life insurance policies. While the rate of inflation has been normalizing from its peak in 2022, lapses of term life insurance policies have remained above long-term historical levels. The continuation of the elevated cost of living could adversely impact demand for our products. 
 The effects of these trends and conditions on our quarterly results are discussed below in the Results of Operations and Financial Condition sections. 
 Size of the Independent Sales Force. 
 Our ability to increase the size of the independent sales force independent sales representatives or independent sales force is largely based on the success of the independent sales force s recruiting efforts as well as training and motivating recruits to get licensed to sell life insurance. We believe that recruitment and licensing levels are important to independent sales force trends, and growth in recruiting and licensing is usually indicative of future growth in the overall size of the independent sales force. Recruiting changes do not always result in commensurate changes in the size of the licensed independent sales force because new recruits may obtain the requisite licenses at rates above or below historical levels.

The number of new recruits increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the momentum following our biennial convention held in July 2024 and special recruiting incentives that were offered in connection with the convention. Approximately 81,000 individuals were recruited while the special incentives were in place. In addition, positive sentiment regarding interest in our business opportunity along with the demand for supplemental income likely contributed to the increase in recruiting. 
 
 New life-licensed independent sales representatives increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 as the pipeline of recruits has increased year-over-year.

 The face amount of term life insurance policies in-force increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as the face amount issued continued to exceed the face amount terminated. Issued face amount during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to the increase in the number of new policies issued as discussed above. Policy terminations increased year-over-year but were consistent when measured as a percentage of beginning face amount in-force. Policy terminations were elevated in all periods with the high cost of living a likely key contributing factor.

Changes in Investment and Savings Product Sales, Asset Values and Accounts/Positions During the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Product sales. Investment and savings product sales increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to our ability to leverage increased demand across all product lines except for Canadian segregated funds. The increase in demand was driven by strong equity market performance in the period leading up to and including the first nine months of 2024. In particular, variable annuity product sales continued to lead the growth in sales as the guarantees offered by these products have become more appealing to investors given strong equity market performance and elevated interest rates. The increase in product sales for managed investments was also impacted by a favorable comparison to the prior year. Sales during the third quarter of 2023 were temporarily disrupted by the transition of our managed accounts platform to a different third-party clearing broker. Marginally offsetting the increase in product sales were lower year-over-year sales of Canadian segregated funds as sales of investments in new Canadian segregated funds accounts have effectively been discontinued after May 2023 due to new regulations in Canada. Refer to the MD A section of the 2023 Annual Report for more information on regulations impacting Canadian segregated funds. 
 Rollforward of client asset values. Ending client asset values increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the difference in market performance during each respective period. 
 32 

Average client asset values. Average client asset values were higher for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven by the cumulative effect of market increases and net client inflows. 
 Average number of fee-generating positions. The average number of fee-generating positions was higher during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the cumulative effect of retail mutual fund sales in recent periods that led to an increase in the number of retail mutual fund positions serviced on our transfer agent recordkeeping platform. 
 Changes in Investment and Savings Product Sales, Asset Values and Accounts/Positions During the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Product sales. Investment and savings product sales increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the same factors as described in the three month comparison. 
 Rollforward of client asset values. Ending client asset values increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to market performance during each respective period. 
 Average client asset values. Average client asset values was higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the same factors as described in the three month comparison. 
 Average number of fee-generating positions. The average number of fee-generating positions was higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the same factors as described in the three month comparison. 
 Regulatory Changes. 
 
 Fiduciary standards for investment recommendations. In April 2024, the DOL issued a fiduciary rule package DOL Fiduciary Package that revises the fiduciary definition and amends certain prohibited transaction exemptions relied on by fiduciaries subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for the receipt of compensation. Since its release, multiple litigants have challenged the DOL Fiduciary Package and its effective date has been stayed by the courts pending final resolution of the litigation. We will not make substantial adjustments to our Investment and Savings Products business operations in response to this rule. 
 
 Restrictions on compensation models in Canada. In response to regulatory changes in Canada by the Canadian Securities Administrators CSA, the provincial and territorial securities commissions), we developed a set of mutual fund products with two third-party mutual fund companies that are sold exclusively by our independent sales representatives (the Principal Distributor funds ). The revenue we receive is primarily in the form of asset-based distribution fees from the mutual fund companies and asset-based service fees that are charged to investors. In turn, the primary compensation we offer independent sales representatives is the option of an up-front sales commission or higher asset-based commissions over time. Although we received the requisite approval, the CSA, as they indicated to us at the outset, is closely examining the model, and we expect there will be a public consultation on related sales practices, and may require undertakings or consider future amendments that would require modifications to the model, including with respect to its up-front commission features. At this time, we cannot quantify the financial impact, if any, of future changes to our business that may be necessary if our Principal Distributor funds model is required to be modified or discontinued. 
 Factors Affecting Our Results 
 Term Life Insurance Segment. The Term Life Insurance segment results are primarily driven by sales volumes, how closely actual experience matches our pricing assumptions, terms and use of reinsurance, and expenses. 
 Sales and policies in-force. Sales of term policies and the size and characteristics of our in-force book of policies are vital to our results over the long term. Premium revenue is recognized as it is earned over the term of the policy. However, because we incur significant cash outflows at or about the time policies are issued, including the payment of sales commissions and underwriting costs, changes in life insurance sales volume in a period will have a more immediate impact on our cash flows than on revenue. 
 Historically, we have found that while sales volume of term life insurance products between fiscal periods may vary based on a variety of factors, the productivity of sales representatives generally remains within a range (i.e., an average monthly rate of new policies issued per life-licensed independent sales representative between 0.20 and 0.24). The volume of term life insurance products sales will fluctuate in the short term, but over the longer term, our sales volume generally correlates to the size of the independent sales force. 
 Actuarial assumptions. The actuarial assumptions that underlie our reserves are based upon our best estimates of mortality, persistency, disability, and interest rates. Our results will be affected to the extent there is a variance between our actuarial assumptions and actual experience. These variances will be reflected in our financial results by unlocking assumptions and cash flows underlying the liability for future policy benefits LFPB and ceded reserves that are part of the reinsurance recoverables. See Note 10 (Future Policy Benefits) to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more 
 33 

information on LFPB. The variances are also reflected in the projection of future face amount that is the basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs DAC ). 
 Persistency . Persistency is a measure of how long our insurance policies stay in-force. As a general matter, persistency that is lower than our actuarial assumptions adversely affects our results over the long term because we lose the recurring revenue stream associated with the policies that lapse. In general, persistency differences have a minimal impact on our financial results from period to period since DAC is generally amortized on a straight-line basis and the unlocking of the LFPB adjusts both expected net premiums and expected future policy benefits and spreads any variances over the remaining contract period. 

Mortality. Our profitability will fluctuate to the extent actual mortality rates differ from actuarial assumptions. We mitigate a significant portion of our mortality exposure through reinsurance. Long term mortality variances that result in an assumption change may have a significant impact on our financial results. 

Disability. Our profitability will fluctuate to the extent actual disability rates underlying our waiver of premium benefits, including recovery rates for individuals currently disabled, differ from actuarial assumptions. The waiver of premium benefit is secondary to the death benefit coverage provided. However, the waiver of premium benefit is not reinsured on a yearly renewable term YRT basis and material changes in assumptions compared to expectations can have a disproportionate impact on our financial results. 

Interest Rates. We use a locked-in assumption for future interest rates for reserves underlying our segment results. Policies issued prior to the January 1, 2021 transition date of the Company's adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-12, Financial Services Insurance (Topic 944) Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts (the Transition Date use an interest rate that reflects the portfolio s current reinvestment rate while policies issued on or after the Transition Date use an upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yield during the period of issue. 

Reinsurance. We use reinsurance extensively, which has a significant effect on our results of operations. We have generally reinsured between 80 and 90 of the mortality risk on term life insurance (excluding coverage under certain riders) on a quota share YRT basis. To the extent actual mortality experience is more or less favorable than the contractual rate, the reinsurer will earn incremental profits or bear the incremental cost, as applicable. In contrast to coinsurance, which is intended to eliminate all risks (other than counterparty risk of the reinsurer) and rewards associated with a specified percentage of the block of policies subject to the reinsurance arrangement, the YRT reinsurance arrangements we enter into are intended only to reduce volatility associated with variances between estimated and actual mortality rates. 
 In 2010, as part of our corporate reorganization and the initial public offering of our common stock, we entered into significant coinsurance transactions (the IPO coinsurance transactions with entities then affiliated with Citigroup, Inc. (collectively, the IPO coinsurers and ceded between 80 and 90 of the risks and rewards of term life insurance policies that were in-force at year-end 2009. We administer all such policies subject to these coinsurance agreements. Policies reaching the end of their initial level term period are no longer ceded under the IPO coinsurance transactions. 
 The effect of our reinsurance arrangements on ceded premiums and benefits and expenses on our statements of income follows: 
 Ceded premiums. Ceded premiums are the premiums we pay to reinsurers. These amounts are deducted from the direct premiums we earn to calculate our net premium revenues. Similar to direct premium revenues, ceded coinsurance premiums remain level over the initial term of the insurance policy. Ceded YRT premiums increase over the period that the policy has been in-force. Accordingly, ceded YRT premiums generally constitute an increasing percentage of direct premiums over the policy term. 

Benefits and claims. Benefits and claims include incurred claim amounts and changes in future policy benefit reserves. Reinsurance reduces incurred claims in direct proportion to the percentage ceded and reinsurance cash flows are reflected in the ceded reserves included in reinsurance recoverables. Changes in ceded reserves offset changes in future policy benefit reserves. 

Insurance expenses. Insurance expenses are reduced by the allowances received from coinsurance. There is no impact on insurance expenses associated with our YRT contracts. 

We may alter our reinsurance practices at any time due to the unavailability of YRT reinsurance at attractive rates or the availability of alternatives to reduce our risk exposure. We intend to continue ceding approximately 90 of our U.S. and Canadian mortality risk on new business. 
 Expenses. Results are also affected by variances in client acquisition, maintenance and administration expense levels. 
 Investment and Savings Products Segment. The Investment and Savings Products segment results are primarily driven by sales, the value of assets in client accounts for which we earn ongoing management, marketing and support, and distribution fees, and the number of transfer agent recordkeeping positions and non-bank custodial fee-generating accounts we administer. 
 34 

Sales. We earn commissions and fees, such as dealer re-allowances and marketing and distribution fees, based on sales of mutual fund products and annuities in the United States and sales of certain mutual fund products in Canada. Sales of investment and savings products are influenced by the overall demand for investment products in the United States and Canada, as well as by the size and productivity of the independent sales force. We generally experience seasonality in the Investment and Savings Products segment results due to our high concentration of sales of retirement account products. These accounts are typically funded in February through April, coincident with our clients tax return preparation season. While we believe the size of the independent sales force is a factor in driving sales volume in this segment, there are a number of other variables, such as economic and market conditions, which may have a significantly greater effect on sales volume in any given fiscal period. 
 Asset values in client accounts. We earn marketing and distribution fees (trail commissions or, with respect to U.S. mutual funds, 12b-1 fees) on mutual fund and annuity assets in the United States and Canada. In the United States, we also earn investment advisory and administrative fees on assets in managed investments. In Canada, we earn marketing, distribution, and shareholder services fees on mutual fund assets for which we serve as the principal distributor and management fees on the segregated funds for which we serve as investment manager. Asset values are influenced by new product sales, ongoing contributions to existing accounts, redemptions and the change in market values in existing accounts. While we offer a wide variety of asset classes and investment styles, our clients accounts are primarily invested in equity funds. Volatility in equity markets will impact the value of assets in client accounts and, as a result, the revenue we earn on those assets. 
 Positions. We earn transfer agent recordkeeping fees for administrative functions we perform on behalf of several of our mutual fund providers. An individual client account may include multiple fund positions for which we earn transfer agent recordkeeping fees. We may also receive fees earned for non-bank custodial services that we provide to clients with retirement plan accounts. 
 Sales mix. While our investment and savings products all provide similar long-term economic returns to the Company, our results in a given fiscal period will be affected by changes in the overall mix of products within these categories. Examples of changes in the sales mix that influence our results include the following: 
 sales of annuity products in the United States will generate higher revenues in the period such sales occur than sales of other investment products that either generate lower up-front revenues or, in the case of managed investments and segregated funds, no up-front revenues; 

sales of a higher proportion of managed investments, Canadian mutual funds, and segregated funds products will spread the revenues generated over time because we earn higher revenues based on assets under management for these accounts each period as opposed to earning up-front revenues based on product sales; and 

sales of a higher proportion of mutual fund products sold in the United States will impact the timing and amount of revenue we earn given the distinct transfer agent recordkeeping and non-bank custodial services we provide for certain mutual fund products we distribute. 

Corporate and Other Distributed Products Segment. We earn revenues and pay commissions and referral fees within the Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment for mortgage loan originations, prepaid legal services, auto and homeowners insurance referrals, and other financial products, all of which are originated by third parties. The Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment also includes in-force policies from several discontinued lines of insurance underwritten by NBLIC. 
 The Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment includes net investment income recognized by the Company. Net investment income is impacted by the size and performance of our invested asset portfolio, which can be influenced by interest rates, credit spreads, and the mix of invested assets. Net investment income also is influenced by short-term interest rates and the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
 The Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment also includes corporate income and expenses not allocated to our other segments, general and administrative expenses (other than expenses that are allocated to the Term Life Insurance and Investment and Savings Products segments), interest expense on notes payable, a redundant reserve financing transaction and our revolving credit facility Revolving Credit Facility ), as well as realized gains and losses on our invested asset portfolio. 
 Capital Structure. Our financial results are affected by our capital structure, which includes our senior unsecured notes (the Senior Notes ), a redundant reserve financing transaction, our Revolving Credit Facility, and our common stock. See Note 11 (Stockholders Equity), Note 14 (Commitments and Contingent Liabilities), and Note 16 (Debt) to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on changes in our capital structure. 
 Foreign Currency. The Canadian dollar is the functional currency for our Canadian subsidiaries and our consolidated financial results, reported in U.S. dollars, are affected by changes in the currency exchange rate. As such, the translated amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries will be higher or lower in periods where the Canadian dollar appreciates or weakens relative to the U.S. dollar, respectively. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Canadian Currency Risk included in our 2023 Annual Report and Note 3 (Segment and Geographical Information) to our 
 35 

unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on our Canadian subsidiaries and the impact of foreign currency on our financial results. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ). These principles are established primarily by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 (Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report. The most significant items in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets are based on fair value determinations, accounting estimates and actuarial determinations, which are susceptible to changes in future periods and could affect our results of operations and financial position. 
 The estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial position are those related to DAC, future policy benefit reserves and corresponding amounts recoverable from reinsurers, income taxes, and the valuation of investments. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management s analyses and judgments. Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results.

 Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Total revenues. Total revenues increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in commissions and fees earned in our Investment and Savings Products segment, net 
 36 

premiums earned in our Term Life Insurance segment, and net investment income and investment gains earned in our Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment. These movements are further discussed in detail in the Segment Results sections below. 
 Total benefits and expenses. Total benefits and expenses increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 largely due to higher sales commissions in our Investment and Savings Products segment, and higher insurance expenses and other operating expenses. Insurance expenses and other operating expenses were higher in the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher variable growth-related costs, infrastructure technology investments, and employee-related costs, which includes higher incentive compensation given current year results. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase are higher benefits and claims and amortization of DAC in our Term Life Insurance segment. Partially offsetting these increases was a future policy benefits remeasurement gain compared to a small remeasurement loss in the comparative period. These movements are discussed in further detail in the Segment Results section below. 
 Income taxes. Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations of 23.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was largely consistent compared to 23.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to Note 18 (Income Taxes) to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a comparison of the year-over-year effective income tax rate. 
 Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes. Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes relates to the Senior Health business, which was disposed of as of September 30, 2024 and is reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Refer to Note 2 (Discontinued Operations) to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details. 
 For additional information, see the Segment Results discussions below. 
 Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Total revenues. Total revenues increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the same factors as described in the three month comparison as well as a 50.0 million gain recognized within other, net revenue in our Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment related to payments received under a Representation and Warranty insurance policy in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Total benefits and expenses. Total benefits and expenses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the same factors as described in the three month comparison. 
 Income taxes. Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations of 23.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was largely consistent compared to 23.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to Note 18 (Income Taxes) to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a comparison of the year-over-year effective income tax rate. 
 Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes. Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes relates to the Senior Health business, which was disposed of as of September 30, 2024 and is reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented.

 Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Net premiums. Direct premiums increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 largely due to the layering effect of new policy sales that contributed to growth in the in-force book of business. This increase was partially offset by an increase in ceded premiums, which includes 6.2 million in higher non-level YRT reinsurance ceded premiums as business not subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions ages, reduced by 4.5 million in lower coinsurance ceded premiums due to the run-off of business subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions. 
 Benefits and claims. Benefits and claims increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Direct benefits and claims increased with the growth in the business. Year-over-year claims incurred during the three month period in 2024 were higher compared to the three month period in 2023 and in line with the growth in the in-force book of business. 
 Future policy benefits remeasurement (gain) loss. Future policy benefits remeasurement gain increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and represents the impact of long-term assumption changes made during the third quarter in connection with the annual assumption review as well as differences in experience variances that occurred in each period. The gain recognized in the 2024 period is primarily due to an assumption change related to the reduction of the expected cost of waiver of premium benefits. Refer to Note 10 (Future Policy Benefits) to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details. 
 Amortization of DAC. The amortization of DAC increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to continued growth in the in-force book of business. 
 Insurance expenses. Insurance expenses increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher costs resulting from growth in the business, employee-related costs, and higher variable expenses to support recruiting and licensing. 
 Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Net premiums. Direct premiums increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 largely due to the layering effect of new policy sales that contributed to growth in the in-force book of business. This increase was partially offset by an increase in ceded premiums, which includes 26.9 million in higher non-level YRT reinsurance ceded premiums as business not subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions ages, reduced by 18.0 million in lower coinsurance ceded premiums due to the run-off of business subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions. 
 Benefits and claims. Benefits and claims increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the same factors as described in the three month comparison. 
 Future policy benefits remeasurement (gain) loss. Future policy benefits remeasurement gain increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the same factors as described in the three month comparison.

 Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Commissions and fees. Commissions and fees increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by higher sales-based and asset-based revenues. The increase in sales-based revenue was largely the result of higher product sales for variable annuities and U.S. mutual fund product sales. Higher asset-based revenues were driven by an increase in average client assets in the 2024 period versus the prior year period. 
 Sales commissions. The increase in sales-based commissions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was generally in line with the increases in sales-based revenues although modestly lower due to a mix shift towards higher margin variable annuity sales. Asset-based commissions were up for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and were consistent with the movement in asset-based revenues when excluding Canadian segregated funds revenue. Asset-based expenses for our Canadian segregated funds are reflected within insurance commissions and amortization of DAC. 
 Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher growth-related costs and employee-related costs. 
 Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Commissions and fees. Commissions and fees increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the same factors as described in the three month comparison. 
 Sales commissions. Sales commissions increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the same factors as described in the three month comparison. 
 Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the same factors as described in the three month comparison.

 Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Total revenues. Total revenues increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher net investment income and investment gains. Net investment income increased 2.2 million from higher yields in the invested asset portfolio, 2.0 million from a larger invested asset portfolio, and a 1.9 million higher total return on the deposit asset backing our 10 coinsurance agreement compared to the same period in the prior year. Investment income net of investment expenses includes interest earned on our held-to-maturity asset, which is offset by interest expense on the surplus note Surplus Note ), thereby eliminating any impact on net investment income. Amounts recognized for each line item will remain offsetting and will fluctuate from period to period along with the principal amounts of the held-to-maturity asset and the Surplus Note based on the balance of reserves being contractually supported under a redundant reserve financing transaction used by Vidalia Re, Inc. Vidalia Re ). For more information on the Surplus Note, see Note 4 (Investments) and Note 16 (Debt) to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 The Company recorded investment gains during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to investment losses during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 2.3 million positive mark-to-market adjustment on equity securities held within our investment portfolio during the 2024 period compared to a 1.8 million negative mark-to-market adjustment during the 2023 period. Partially offsetting these changes was lower commission revenue from other distributed products. 
 Total benefits and expenses. Total benefits and expenses increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a future policy benefits remeasurement loss in the third quarter of 2024 recorded in connection with the refinement of assumptions on a closed block of non-term life insurance as well as higher employee-related costs, infrastructure technology investments, legal expenses and corporate restructuring charges associated with the decision to exit the Senior Health business. 
 Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Total revenues. Total revenues increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also due to higher net investment income, higher investment gains, and the 50.0 million gain within other, net revenue related to payments received under a Representation and Warranty insurance policy. Net investment income increased 8.4 million from higher yields in the invested asset portfolio, 6.0 million from a larger invested asset portfolio, and 2.8 million from higher total returns on the deposit asset backing our 10 coinsurance agreement compared to the prior year period. For more

information on the gain related to payments received under the Representation and Warranty insurance policy, refer to Note 3 (Segment and Geographical Information) to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 The Company recorded investment gains during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to investment losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 3.0 million positive mark-to-market adjustment on equity securities held within our investment portfolio during the 2024 period compared to a 3.9 million negative mark-to-market adjustment during the 2023 period. Partially offsetting these changes was lower commission revenue from other distributed products. 
 Total benefits and expenses. Total benefits and expenses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the same factors as described in the three month comparison . These increases were partially offset by a decrease in benefits and claims as a result of a credit loss recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for the remaining ceded reserves on a closed block of non-term life insurance business from an insolvent reinsurer that was ordered into liquidation. 
 Financial Condition 
 Investments. Our insurance business is primarily focused on selling term life insurance, which does not include an investment component for the policyholder. The invested asset portfolio funded by premiums from our term life insurance business does not involve the substantial asset accumulations and spread requirements that exist with other non-term life insurance products. As a result, the profitability of our term life insurance business is not as sensitive to the impact that interest rates have on our invested asset portfolio and investment income as the profitability of other companies that distribute non-term life insurance products. 
 We follow a conservative investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of our invested assets and provide adequate liquidity for the prompt payment of claims. To meet business needs and mitigate risks, our investment guidelines provide restrictions on our portfolio s composition, including limits on asset type, per issuer limits, credit quality limits, portfolio duration, limits on the amount of investments in approved countries and permissible security types. We also manage and monitor our allocation of investments to limit the accumulation of any disproportionate concentrations of risk among industry sectors or issuer countries outside of the U.S. and Canada. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we did not hold any country of issuer concentrations outside of the U.S. or Canada that represented more than 5 of the fair value of our available-for-sale invested asset portfolio or any industry concentrations of corporate bonds that represented more than 10 of the fair value of our available-for-sale invested asset portfolio. 
 We invest a portion of our portfolio in assets denominated in Canadian dollars to support our Canadian operations. Additionally, to ensure adequate liquidity for payment of claims, we take into account the maturity and duration of our invested asset portfolio and our general liability profile. 
 We also hold within our invested asset portfolio a credit enhanced note LLC Note issued by a limited liability company owned by a third-party service provider which is classified as a held-to-maturity security. The LLC Note, which is scheduled to mature on December 31, 2030, was obtained in exchange for the Surplus Note of equal principal amount issued by Vidalia Re, a special purpose financial captive insurance company and wholly owned subsidiary of Primerica Life. For more information on the LLC Note, see Note 4 (Investments) to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 We have an investment committee composed of members of our senior management team that is responsible for establishing and maintaining our investment guidelines and supervising our investment activity. Our investment committee regularly monitors our overall investment results and our compliance with our investment objectives and guidelines. We use a third-party investment advisor to assist us in the management of our investing activities. Our investment advisor reports to our investment committee. 
 Our invested asset portfolio is subject to a variety of risks, including risks related to general economic conditions, market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, liquidity risk and credit and default risk. Investment guideline restrictions have been established to minimize the effect of these risks but may not always be effective due to factors beyond our control. Interest rates and credit spreads are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates or credit spreads could result in significant losses in the value of our invested asset portfolio. We believe that fluctuations caused by movement in interest rates and credit spreads generally have little bearing on the recoverability of our investments as we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity or a market price recovery and we have no present intention to dispose of them.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Dividends and other payments to the Parent Company from its subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash. The amount of dividends paid by the subsidiaries is dependent on their capital needs to fund future growth and applicable regulatory restrictions. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company include the payments of stockholder dividends, interest on notes payable, general operating expenses, and income taxes, as well as repurchases of shares of our common stock outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company had cash and invested assets of 382.5 million. 
 The Parent Company s subsidiaries generate operating cash flows primarily from term life insurance premiums (net of premiums ceded to reinsurers), income from invested assets, commissions and fees collected from the distribution of investment and savings products, as well as other financial products. The subsidiaries principal operating cash outflows include the payment of insurance claims and benefits (net of ceded claims recovered from reinsurers), commissions to the sales force, insurance and other operating expenses, interest expense for future policy benefit reserves financing transactions, and income taxes. 
 The distribution and underwriting of term life insurance requires up-front cash outlays at the time the policy is issued as we pay a substantial majority of the sales commission during the first year following the sale of a policy and incur costs for underwriting activities at the inception of a policy s term. During the early years of a policy s term, we generally receive level term premiums in excess of claims paid. We invest the excess cash generated during earlier policy years in fixed-maturity and equity securities held in support of future policy benefit reserves. In later policy years, cash received from the maturity or sale of invested assets is used to pay claims in excess of level term premiums received. 
 Historically, cash flows generated by our businesses, primarily from our existing block of term life insurance policies and our investment and savings products, have provided us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We anticipate that cash flows from our businesses will continue to provide sufficient operating liquidity over the next 12 months. 
 42 

If necessary, we could seek to enhance our liquidity position or capital structure through sales of our available-for-sale investment portfolio, changes in the timing or amount of share repurchases, borrowings against our Revolving Credit Facility, or some combination of these sources. Additionally, we believe that cash flows from our businesses and potential sources of funding will sufficiently support our long-term liquidity needs.

Operating Activities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the increase in net income excluding non-cash impairments recognized in discontinued operations and the gain recognized from insurance proceeds received under a Representation and Warranty insurance policy in 2024. In addition, timing differences of purchases and maturities of trading securities contributed to the year-over-year increase in cash provided by operating activities. 
 Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to fluctuations in the timing of maturities and reinvestments of debt securities held in our available-for-sale investment portfolio as well as an overall increase in the size of the portfolio given the increase in our Term Life insurance in force. In addition, 18.6 million of cash was included in the disposal of the Senior Health business. The 50.0 million received under a Representation and Warranty insurance policy partially offset the increase in cash used in investing activities in the 2024 period. 
 Financing Activities. Cash flows used in financing activities increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Contributing to the increase in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily due to the increase in the size of the share repurchase program in 2024 as well as differences in the timing of share repurchases during each period. In addition, the increase in the per share dividend paid by the Company in the first nine months of 2024 contributed to the increase in cash used in financing activities. 
 Risk-Based Capital RBC ). The National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC has established RBC standards for U.S. life insurers, as well as a risk-based capital model act (the RBC Model Act that has been adopted by the insurance regulatory authorities. The RBC Model Act requires that life insurers annually submit a report to state regulators regarding their RBC based upon four categories of risk: asset risk; insurance risk; interest rate risk and business risk. The capital requirement for each is determined by applying factors that vary based upon the degree of risk to various asset, premiums and policy benefit reserve items. The formula is an early warning tool to identify possible weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action. As of September 30, 2024, our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries maintained statutory capital and surplus substantially in excess of the applicable regulatory requirements and remain well positioned to support existing operations and fund future growth. 
 In Canada, an insurer s minimum capital requirement is overseen by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions OSFI and determined as the sum of the capital requirements for six categories of risk: asset default risk; mortality/morbidity/lapse/expense risks; changes in interest rate environment risk; operational risk; segregated funds risk; and foreign exchange risk. As of September 30, 2024, Primerica Life Canada was in compliance with Canada's minimum capital requirements as defined by OSFI. 
 Redundant Reserve Financing. The Model Regulation entitled Valuation of Life Insurance Policies, commonly known as Regulation XXX, requires insurers to carry statutory policy benefit reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees which are often significantly in excess of the future policy benefit reserves that insurers deem necessary to satisfy claim obligations redundant policy benefit reserves ). Accordingly, many insurance companies have sought ways to reduce their capital needs by financing redundant policy benefit reserves through bank financing, reinsurance arrangements and other financing transactions. 
 We have established Vidalia Re as a special purpose financial captive insurance company and wholly owned subsidiary of Primerica Life. Primerica Life has ceded certain term life insurance policies issued in 2011 through 2017 to Vidalia Re as part of a Regulation XXX redundant reserve financing transaction (the Vidalia Re Redundant Reserve Financing Transaction ). This redundant reserve financing transaction allows us to more efficiently manage and deploy our capital. 
 The NAIC has adopted a model regulation for determining reserves using a principle-based approach principle-based reserves or PBR ), which is designed to reflect each insurer s own experience in calculating reserves and move away from a single prescriptive 
 43 

reserving formula. Primerica Life adopted PBR as of January 1, 2018 and NBLIC adopted the New York amended version of PBR effective January 1, 2021. PBR significantly reduced the redundant statutory policy benefit reserve requirements while still ensuring adequate liabilities are held. The regulation only applies for business issued after the effective dates. See Note 4 (Investments), Note 11 (Debt) and Note 17 (Commitments and Contingent Liabilities) to our consolidated financial statements within our 2023 Annual Report for more information on the Vidalia Re Redundant Reserve Financing Transaction. 
 Notes Payable. The Company has 600.0 million of publicly-traded Senior Notes outstanding issued at a price of 99.55 with an annual interest rate of 2.80 , payable semi-annually in arrears on May 19 and November 19. The Senior Notes are scheduled to mature on November 19, 2031. We were in compliance with the covenants of the Senior Notes as of September 30, 2024. No events of default occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Rating Agencies. There have been no changes to Primerica, Inc. s Senior Notes ratings or Primerica Life s financial strength ratings since December 31, 2023. 
 Surplus Note. Vidalia Re issued a Surplus Note in exchange for the LLC Note as a part of the Vidalia Re Redundant Reserve Financing Transaction. The Surplus Note has a principal amount equal to the LLC Note and is scheduled to mature on December 31, 2030. For more information on the Surplus Note, see Note 16 (Debt) to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, under which the Company maintains any off-balance sheet obligations or guarantees as of September 30, 2024. 
 Credit Facility Agreement. We maintain an unsecured 200.0 million Revolving Credit Facility with a syndicate of commercial banks that has a scheduled termination date of June 22, 2026. Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a periodic rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR rate loan or the base rate, plus in either case an applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facility contains language that allows for the Company and the lenders to agree on a comparable or successor reference rate in the event SOFR is no longer available. The Revolving Credit Facility also permits the issuance of letters of credit. The applicable margins are based on our debt rating with such margins for SOFR rate loans and letters of credit ranging from 1.000 to 1.625 per annum and for base rate loans ranging from 0.000 to 0.625 per annum. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, we incur a commitment fee that is payable quarterly in arrears and is determined by our debt rating. This commitment fee ranges from 0.100 to 0.225 per annum of the aggregate 200.0 million commitment of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and we were in compliance with its covenants. Furthermore, no events of default occurred under the Revolving Credit Facility during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Contractual Obligations Update. There have been no material changes in contractual obligations from those disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report.
