countries, and the Company operates subsidiaries in the United States, France, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Australia and Mexico. Business Combination Agreement On February 9, 2023, Allurion Technologies Opco, Inc. (formerly Allurion Technologies, Inc., Legacy Allurion and Allurion Technologies, Inc. (formerly Allurion Technologies Holdings, Inc.) entered into the Business Combination Agreement (as subsequently amended on May 2, 2023, the Business Combination Agreement with Compute Health Acquisition Corp. CPUH or "Compute Health"), Compute Health Corp. Merger Sub I and Compute Health LLC Merger Sub II and, together with Merger Sub I, the Merger Subs ). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, on August 1, 2023 (the Closing Date ), the Mergers (as defined below) were consummated in three steps: (a) Compute Health merged with and into Allurion (the CPUH Merger ), with Allurion surviving the CPUH Merger as a publicly listed entity (the time at which the CPUH Merger became effective, the CPUH Merger Effective Time and becoming the sole owner of the Merger Subs; (b) three hours following the consummation of the CPUH Merger, Merger Sub I merged with and into Legacy Allurion (the Intermediate Merger and the time at which the Intermediate Merger became effective, the Intermediate Merger Effective Time ), with Legacy Allurion surviving the Intermediate Merger and becoming a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Allurion; and (c) thereafter, Legacy Allurion merged with and into Merger Sub II (the Final Merger and, collectively with the CPUH Merger and the Intermediate Merger, the Mergers , and together with all other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the Business Combination ), with Merger Sub II surviving the Final Merger and remaining a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Allurion (the time at which the Final Merger became effective, the Final Merger Effective Time ). Shares of Allurion's Common Stock (defined below) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker symbol ALUR on August 2, 2023. Upon completion of the Business Combination, Legacy Allurion's business operations continued as our business operations. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse capitalization in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). Under this method of accounting, Compute Health was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes and Legacy Allurion was the accounting acquirer . Accordingly, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Legacy Allurion issuing stock for the net assets of Compute Health, accompanied by a recapitalization. As a result of the reverse recapitalization, the assets and liabilities of the Company are presented at their historical carrying values, and the assets and liabilities of Compute Health are recognized on the acquisition date and measured on the basis of the net proceeds from the capital transaction, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. This determination is primarily based on the fact that, immediately following the Business Combination, Legacy Allurion stockholders had a majority of the voting power of Allurion, Legacy Allurion controlled the majority of the board seats of Allurion, and Legacy Allurion senior management comprised all of the senior management of Allurion. The equity structure has been restated in all comparative periods up to the Closing Date to reflect the number of shares of the Company's common stock, par value per share ("Common Stock," Allurion Common Stock or the Company s Common Stock ), issued to Legacy Allurion stockholders in connection with the Business Combination. As such, the shares and corresponding capital amounts and earnings per share related to Legacy Allurion's convertible preferred stock and Legacy Allurion common stock prior to the Business Combination have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio of approximately (the "Exchange Ratio") established in the Business Combination. As a result of this retrospective application, certain prior period balances within the condensed consolidated financial statements have changed. Refer to Note 3, Business Combination for further discussion regarding the closing of the Business Combination with Compute Health. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the "Company", "our", and "Allurion" refer to the condensed consolidated operations of Allurion Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries. References to CPUH and Compute Health refer to Compute Health Acquisition Corp. and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Business Combination and references to "Legacy Allurion" refer to Allurion Technologies, Inc. prior to the consummation of the Business Combination.

million and a loss from remeasurement of s million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a gain from remeasurement of million and loss from remeasurement of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are recorded in the statements of operations within Other income, net. The Company translates the foreign functional currency financial statements to U.S. dollars for Allurion Australia Pty Ltd. using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities, the period average exchange rates for revenues and expenses, and the historical exchange rates for equity transactions. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Going Concern The Company has evaluated whether there are certain events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the interim condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company has incurred recurring losses since inception, anticipates net losses and negative operating cash flows for the near future, and may be unable to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants required under its credit facilities. Through September 30, 2024, the Company has funded its operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of its Common Stock, convertible preferred stock, issuance of convertible notes, issuance of term loans, and funds received upon consummation of the Business Combination. The Company has incurred recurring losses and cash outflows from operating activities since its inception, including losses from operations of million and million and cash outflows from operating activities of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. The Company expects to continue to generate significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. Based on the Company's recurring losses from operations incurred since inception, its expectation of continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future, the potential need to raise additional capital to finance its future operations, and the potential of being unable to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants under its credit facilities, the Company has concluded that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued.

RTW Convertible Notes On April 14, 2024, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement (the "Original Note Purchase Agreement") with RTW as agent for the purchasers (the "Purchasers") party thereto from time to time (RTW in such capacity, the "Principal Purchaser"), and Acquiom Agency Services LLC ("Acquiom") as collateral agent for the Purchasers. Subsequently, on April 16, 2024, the Company, the Principal Purchaser, the Purchasers, and Acquiom entered into the First Amendment to the Original Note Purchase Agreement (the Original Note Purchase Agreement as amended, the "Amended Note Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the Amended Note Purchase Agreement, the Company issued and sold million of convertible senior secured notes (the "RTW Convertible Notes"). The RTW Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of , which interest is paid quarterly in cash or, at the Company's option, in kind for the first three years. The RTW Convertible Notes will mature on unless previously converted pursuant to the terms of the Amended Note Purchase Agreement. The RTW Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of Allurion Common Stock, at a Purchaser s election at any time after the earliest of (i) the date on which Stockholder Approval (as defined below) is obtained, (ii) December 31, 2025, (iii) the date of a Fundamental Change Company Notice (as defined in the Amended Note Purchase Agreement), and (iv) the Make-Whole Fundamental Change Effective Date (as defined in the Amended Note Purchase Agreement), subject to certain terms and limitations in the Amended Note Purchase Agreement, based on a conversion rate of shares of common stock per principal amount of Notes (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share, which represents a premium to the lowest price per share in an equity financing for capital raising purposes ending on the date on which the Company has raised aggregate gross offering proceeds of at least (the Next Equity Financing ). On July 1, 2024, we consummated the Public Offering, as described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which constituted a Next Equity Financing. The Amended Note Purchase Agreement provides that unless and until requisite approval of the Company s stockholders is obtained Stockholder Approval ), the Company will not deliver Allurion Common Stock upon conversion of the RTW Convertible Notes in excess of of the number of shares of Allurion Common Stock outstanding as of April 14, 2024. The RTW Convertible Notes are accounted for under the FVO election of ASC 825 as the notes contain embedded derivatives, including the conversion upon Stockholder Approval, the conversion upon a Fundamental Change Company Notice, the conversion upon a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, redemption upon the event of default, and redemption upon a Fundamental Change, which would require bifurcation and separate accounting. The RTW Convertible Notes were initially measured at their issue-date estimated fair value and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. The fair value of the RTW Convertible Notes at issuance was million, with a corresponding million loss recognized in Other income, net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. In connection with the issuance of the RTW Convertible Notes and RIFA Amendment (as defined below), we incurred million in issuance costs, which were directly expensed through general and administrative expense due to the FVO election of the RTW Convertible Notes and Revenue Interest Financing. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded gains of million and million through the condensed consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss), respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded gains of million and million through the condensed consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss), respectively. The Amended Note Purchase Agreement contains financial maintenance covenants, which require (i) the Company maintain not less than in unrestricted cash in controlled accounts in the U.S. at all times, (ii) the Company to receive minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated revenue at amounts designated in the Amended Note Purchase Agreement, tested quarterly beginning with the twelve-month period ending March 31, 2025, and (iii) the Company's and its subsidiaries consolidated business operations outside the United States to be profitable for the trailing three-month period, tested quarterly beginning with the three-month period ending December 31, 2025. The Company is in compliance with the covenants in the Amended Note Purchase Agreement as of September 30, 2024. The Company elected paid in kind interest for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the RTW Convertible Notes. 

million Investment Amount. In exchange for the Investment Amount, Allurion will remit revenue interest payments on all current and future products, digital solutions and services developed, imported, manufactured, marketed, offered for sale, promoted, sold, tested or otherwise distributed by Allurion and its subsidiaries at a rate up to of annual net sales prior to December 31, 2026. On or after January 1, 2027, the

of annual net sales, and it will continue to make revenue interest payments to RTW until December 31, 2030. If RTW has not received aggregate revenue interest payments equal to at least of the Investment Amount by December 31, 2027, the Company must make a cash payment in an amount sufficient to catch RTW up to of the Investment Amount. If RTW has not received revenue interest payments equal to at least of the Investment Amount by December 31, 2030, the Company must make a cash payment in an amount sufficient to catch RTW up to of the Investment Amount. In any event, RTW shall not receive aggregated revenue interest payments in excess of of the Investment Amount (the "Hard Cap"). In addition, prior to December 31, 2025, the Company may prepay a pre-specified payment amount (the "Prepayment Amount") and terminate the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement. The Prepayment Amount shall be an amount equal to of the Investment Amount less the sum of all revenue interest payments made to RTW prior to such date of prepayment. The Revenue Interest Financing is accounted for under the FVO election of ASC 825 as the Revenue Interest Financing contains embedded derivatives, including the requirements to settle the Revenue Interest Financing prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain contingent events and our ability to prepay the Revenue Interest Financing, which would require bifurcation and separate accounting. The Revenue Interest Financing was initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. Changes in fair value are recorded as a component of Other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. A portion of the estimated change in fair value must be reported in other comprehensive loss to the extent that it is attributable to instrument-specific credit risk. In connection with the issuance of the Investment Amount, we paid million in issuance costs in August 2023, which were directly expensed through general and administrative expense due to the FVO election. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has made million in royalty payments to RTW. Refer to Note 10, Fair Value Measurements , for additional information regarding the changes in fair value of the Revenue Interest Financing. Concurrently, and in connection with the Amended Note Purchase Agreement, the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement was amended pursuant to the Omnibus Amendment (the "RIFA Amendment") by and among the Company, Allurion Opco, Allurion Australia Pty Ltd, a proprietary limited company organized under the laws of Australia and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the Original RIFA Investors (as defined therein) and RTW, on April 14, 2024. The RIFA Amendment, among other things, increased the rate of revenue interest payments to be paid to RTW on all current and future products, digital solutions and services developed, imported, manufactured, marketed, offered for sale, promoted, sold, tested or otherwise distributed by Allurion and its subsidiaries for net sales less than or equal to million prior to December 31, 2026 from to and increased the rate on net sales in less than or equal to million on or after January 1, 2027 from to . Additionally, the Prepayment Amount was modified such that, prior to March 31, 2026, the Company is entitled to settle the Revenue Interest Financing for a prepayment amount that would allow the investors to yield a internal rate of return. In connection with the Company entering into the Revenue Interest Financing, if, at any time beginning 12 months and ending 24 months following the closing of the Mergers, the VWAP per share of Allurion Common Stock is less than for the average of trading days within any trading day period Stock Price Drop and the absolute value of the percentage decrease of such Stock Price Drop measured from a reference price of per share of Allurion Common Stock is greater than the absolute value of the percentage decrease in the VWAP of a comparable publicly traded peer index as defined in the Amended and Restated RTW Side Letter over the same time period, then RTW may elect to convert up to million of its initial PIPE Investment into additional revenue interest financing to be added to the Investment Amount by forfeiting a number of shares of Allurion Common Stock acquired in the PIPE Investment. Such additions to the Investment Amount would result in proportional increases to the minimum aggregate revenue interest payments described above. The PIPE Conversion Option is accounted for as a derivative under ASC 815. The PIPE Conversion Option was initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value of million within Other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets with corresponding recognition of expense at inception as there is no right received by the Company that meets the definition of an asset and the transaction did not involve a distribution or a dividend. The PIPE Conversion Option liability is subsequently remeasured at its estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date, with a gain or loss recognized within Other income (expense). The RIFA Amendment was accounted for as a modification with the change in fair value of the PIPE Conversion Option treated as an exchange between the Company and RTW as part of the RIFA Amendment. As such, the Revenue Interest Financing and PIPE Conversion Option were remeasured as of April 16, 2024 just prior to the RIFA Amendment, to million and million, respectively. The Revenue Interest Financing and PIPE Conversion Option were subsequently remeasured as of April 16, 2024 under the terms of the RIFA Amendment, to million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Revenue Interest Financing and PIPE Conversion Option were million and million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a million loss and a million gain on the Revenue Interest Financing through the condensed consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss), respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a million loss and a million gain on the Revenue Interest Financing through the condensed consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss),

Total stock compensation expense related to stock option awards during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options granted under the 2010 Plan, 2020 Plan, and 2023 Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting term of years. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the stock option awards granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was per option. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatility for the Company s Common Stock was determined based on an average of the historical volatility of a peer group of public companies that are similar to the Company. The expected term of options granted to employees was calculated using the simplified method, which represents the average of the contractual term of the option and the weighted-average vesting period of the option. The Company uses the simplified method because it does not have sufficient historical option exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The expected term of options granted to non-employees is the remaining contractual term of the award. The assumed dividend yield is based upon the Company s expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Ite m 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis includes information that our management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 that are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024, as subsequently amended (as amended, the "Annual Report on Form 10-K"). This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. For purposes of this section, all references in this discussion and analysis to Allurion, the Company , we, us, or our refers to the business and operations of Allurion and its consolidated subsidiaries following the consummation of the Business Combination and to Legacy Allurion and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. Legacy Allurion refers to Allurion Technologies, LLC, which was previously known as Allurion Technologies Opco, Inc. (formerly Allurion Technologies, Inc.) prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. 
 Overview 
 Allurion is a leading medical device company that is focused on creating a best-in-class weight loss platform to treat obese and overweight patients. Our platform, the Allurion Program (the "Allurion Program"), features the world s first and only swallowable, procedure-less intragastric balloon for weight loss (the "Allurion Balloon") and offers artificial intelligence ("AI")-powered remote patient monitoring tools, a proprietary behavior change program, secure messaging and video telehealth that are delivered by the Allurion Virtual Care Suite ("VCS"). 
 Our proprietary intragastric balloon, the Allurion Balloon, is swallowed as a capsule under the guidance of a health care provider without surgery, endoscopy, or anesthesia for placement. 
 The Allurion VCS is comprised of tools to support patients weight loss experience, which we believe benefit both patients and health care providers: 
 1. For Allurion Program patients: Every current Allurion Program patient receives an Allurion Connected Scale ("Allurion Connected Scale") and access to our mobile app (the "App"), which integrates data from the Allurion Connected Scale to conveniently monitor weight, body fat, activity, sleep, and several other critical metrics. The App can also enable secure messaging and video telehealth with the patient s care team and can deliver content from Allurion s proprietary behavior change program a library of 100 weight loss actions related to diet, nutrition, mental health, sleep, goal setting, and a number of other topics directly to the patient. The App is available in 15 languages. 

2. For Allurion Program providers: Our clinic dashboard ("Allurion Insights") provides end-to-end remote patient monitoring powered by the Allurion Iris AI platform, which leverages machine learning to deliver key insights related to patient tracking data. Allurion Insights offers real-time access to patient data and AI-powered analytics, note functionality to keep track of patient encounters, and clinic-wide metrics that provide a snapshot of the clinic s overall performance. 

In addition to its use by Allurion Balloon patients, we believe the Allurion VCS can potentially be a platform for optimal long-term follow up after other medical and surgical weight loss interventions in the future. For example, in June 2022, we incorporated a Treatment Tracking and Clinic-Led Onboarding feature into the Allurion VCS, which enables seamless onboarding and management of patients undergoing one or multiple weight loss treatments, including gastric balloons such as the Allurion Balloon, surgery, or medications. In addition, in connection with our collaboration with Medtronic plc Medtronic ), we may incorporate the Allurion VCS in onboarding and managing Medtronic s patients. Further, in April 2024, the Company launched the Allurion VCS in the United States for patients utilizing other weight loss treatments, including anti-obesity medications and bariatric surgery. 
 Our products are currently sold in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Canada and the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") has approved the investigational device exemption ("IDE"), for Allurion s AUDACITY clinical trial, a 48-week, prospective, randomized, open-label trial. We received approval of the IDE from the FDA in November 2021 to initiate the AUDACITY clinical trial in the United States. The first patient in the trial was treated in July 2022. During the third quarter of 2023, we completed the enrollment of 550 patients in the trial across 17 sites in the United States and the last patient in the trial was treated in September 2024. The results of the trial are expected to support a premarket approval submission to the FDA. 
 Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve cost improvements sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful further development and commercialization of our products and receipt and maintenance of regulatory approvals. We generated revenue of 26.5 million and 45.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and incurred a net loss of 5.6 million and 61.4 million for those same 
 38 

periods, respectively. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we focus on obtaining regulatory approvals for our products in new markets, reinstating regulatory approvals, refining our sales and marketing strategies, and continuing research and development efforts to further enhance our existing products. Further, following the closing of the Business Combination described below in Recent Developments, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we will need additional funding for expenses related to our operating activities, including selling, marketing, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval, market acceptance of our products, product development and enhancement, and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings and debt financings. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the further development and commercialization efforts of one or more of our products, or may be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. See the subsections titled Liquidity and Capital Resources and Recent Developments below. 
 Recent Developments 
 Business Combination Agreement 
 On February 9, 2023, Allurion Technologies Opco, Inc. (formerly Allurion Technologies, Inc., Legacy Allurion and Allurion Technologies, Inc. (formerly Allurion Technologies Holdings, Inc.) entered into the Business Combination Agreement (as subsequently amended on May 2, 2023, the Business Combination Agreement with Compute Health Acquisition Corp. CPUH or "Compute Health"), Compute Health Corp. Merger Sub I and Compute Health LLC Merger Sub II and, together with Merger Sub I, the Merger Subs ). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, on August 1, 2023 (the Closing Date ), the Mergers (as defined below) were consummated in three steps: (a) Compute Health merged with and into Allurion (the CPUH Merger ), with Allurion surviving the CPUH Merger as a publicly listed entity (the time at which the CPUH Merger became effective, the CPUH Merger Effective Time and becoming the sole owner of the Merger Subs; (b) three hours following the consummation of the CPUH Merger, Merger Sub I merged with and into Legacy Allurion (the Intermediate Merger and the time at which the Intermediate Merger became effective, the Intermediate Merger Effective Time ), with Legacy Allurion surviving the Intermediate Merger and becoming a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Allurion; and (c) thereafter, Legacy Allurion merged with and into Merger Sub II (the Final Merger and, collectively with the CPUH Merger and the Intermediate Merger, the Mergers , and together with all other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the Business Combination ), with Merger Sub II surviving the Final Merger and remaining a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Allurion (the time at which the Final Merger became effective, the Final Merger Effective Time ). Shares of Allurion's Common Stock (defined below) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker symbol ALUR on August 2, 2023. Upon completion of the Business Combination, Legacy Allurion's business operations continued as our business operations. 
 The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse capitalization in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Under this method of accounting, Compute Health, which was the legal acquirer, was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes and Legacy Allurion was the accounting acquirer . Accordingly, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of our company issuing stock for the net assets of Compute Health, accompanied by a recapitalization. Our net assets and the net assets of Compute Health are stated at historical costs, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. This determination is primarily based on the fact that, immediately following the Business Combination, Legacy Allurion stockholders had a majority of the voting power of Allurion, Legacy Allurion controlled the majority of the board seats of Allurion, and Legacy Allurion senior management comprised all of the senior management of Allurion. The equity structure has been restated in all comparative periods up to the Closing Date to reflect the number of shares of the Company's common stock, 0.0001 par value per share Allurion Common Stock or the Company s Common Stock ), issued to Legacy Allurion stockholders in connection with the Business Combination. As such, the shares and corresponding capital amounts and earnings per share related to Legacy Allurion's convertible preferred stock and Legacy Allurion common stock prior to the Business Combination have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio of approximately 0.9780 (the "Exchange Ratio") established in the Business Combination. As a result of this retrospective application, certain prior period balances within the condensed consolidated financial statements have changed. Refer to Note 3, Business Combination in the notes to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the closing of the Business Combination with Compute Health. 
 Note Purchase Agreement 
 On April 14, 2024, Allurion, RTW Investments, LP (together with its affiliates, RTW ), as agent for the purchasers (the Purchasers party thereto from time to time (RTW in such capacity, the Principal Purchaser ), and Acquiom Agency Services LLC Acquiom ), as collateral agent for the Purchasers and the Principal Purchaser, entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the 
 39 

Original Note Purchase Agreement ). Subsequently, on April 16, 2024, the Company, the Principal Purchaser, the Purchasers and Acquiom entered into the First Amendment to the Original Note Purchase Agreement (the Amendment the Original Note Purchase Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, the Amended Note Purchase Agreement ). 
 Pursuant to the Amended Note Purchase Agreement, the Company issued and sold 48 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior secured notes (the Notes to the Purchasers in a private placement transaction. The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to refinance its outstanding obligations under the Fortress Credit Agreement in full and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith and in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Amended Note Purchase Agreement. The Company has terminated and repaid in full the outstanding borrowings and other obligations under the Fortress Credit Agreement. 
 The Notes bear interest at the annual rate of 6.0 , which interest is payable quarterly in cash or, at the Company s option, in kind for the first three years. The maturity date for the Notes is April 16, 2031. The Notes are guaranteed by Allurion Technologies, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Allurion Opco ), and certain other current and future subsidiaries of the Company, and are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and the guarantors. 
 The Notes are convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock, at a Purchaser s election at any time after the earliest of (i) the date on which Stockholder Approval (as defined below) is obtained, (ii) December 31, 2025, (iii) the date of a Fundamental Change Company Notice (as defined in the Amended Note Purchase Agreement), and (iv) the Make-Whole Fundamental Change Effective Date (as defined in the Amended Note Purchase Agreement), subject to certain terms and limitations in the Amended Note Purchase Agreement, based on a conversion rate of 617.2840 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 1.62 per share, which represents a 35 premium to the lowest price per share in an equity financing for capital raising purposes ending on the date on which the Company has raised aggregate gross offering proceeds of at least 15,000,000 (the Next Equity Financing ). On July 1, 2024, we consummated the Public Offering, as described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which constituted a Next Equity Financing. Because the conversion price was reset in connection with the Next Equity Financing to a price below the NYSE s Minimum Price (as such term is defined in Section 312.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual), the Amended Note Purchase Agreement provides that unless and until requisite approval of the Company s stockholders is obtained Stockholder Approval ), the Company will not deliver Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes in excess of 1 of the number of shares of the Company s Common Stock outstanding as of April 14, 2024. The Company is required to include a proposal in its definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A seeking Stockholder Approval no later than December 31, 2025. If the Company does not obtain Stockholder Approval at such meeting, it shall call a special meeting of stockholders each 90-day period thereafter at least two times, and thereafter at each subsequent annual meeting until Stockholder Approval is obtained or the Notes are no longer outstanding; provided, that shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Notes prior to obtaining Stockholder Approval shall not be entitled to vote in favor of Stockholder Approval. 
 Amendment to Revenue Interest Financing Agreement 
 On April 14, 2024, the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement (the "Original RIFA") was amended pursuant to the Omnibus Amendment (the RIFA Amendment by and among the Company, Allurion Opco, Allurion Australia Pty Ltd, a proprietary limited company organized under the laws of Australia and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the Original RIFA Investors (as defined therein) and RTW, to reflect certain modifications agreed between the parties thereto in connection with the Purchasers purchase of the Notes and the refinancing of the Fortress Credit Agreement. Among other things, the RIFA Amendment waived the existing event of default under the Original RIFA, increased the rate of revenue interest payments to be paid to RTW on all current and future products and digital solutions developed and to be developed by the Company (the Royalty Rate for net sales less than or equal to 100 million prior to December 31, 2026 from 6 to 12 , and increased the Royalty Rate on net sales less than or equal to 100 million on or after January 1, 2027 from 10 to 12 , subject to the terms and conditions of the RIFA Amendment. 
 Amendment to RTW Side Letter 
 On April 14, 2024, we, Allurion Opco, Compute Health, Merger Sub II, RTW Master Fund, Ltd., RTW Innovation Master Fund, Ltd. and RTW Biotech Opportunities Operating Ltd. (as transferee from RTW Biotech Opportunities Ltd. (formerly known as RTW Venture Fund Limited)) (in each case, together with their successors and permitted assigns, the Additional RIFA Investors entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Letter Agreement (the Side Letter Amendment to reflect certain modifications to the Amended and Restated RTW Side Letter in connection with the Purchasers purchase of the Notes. The Side Letter Amendment provides, among other things, that the Additional RIFA Investors may make a single election in certain circumstances to convert up to 7,500,000 of the purchase price that the Additional RIFA Investors paid for certain equity interests in the Company into an amount of financing provided by the Additional RIFA Investors to Allurion Opco pursuant to an additional revenue interest financing agreement with Allurion Opco. 
 Termination of Fortress Term Loan 
 On April 16, 2024, we terminated and repaid in full all outstanding borrowings and fees under the Fortress Credit Agreement, dated as of August 1, 2023 (as amended by the Fortress Amendment, dated as of December 29, 2023), by and among the Company, Allurion Opco, the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the "Lenders" 
 40 

and each, a "Lender") and Fortress Credit Corp., as administrative agent for the Lenders, including the release of all guarantees and liens related thereto. 
 
 Public Offering 
 On June 28, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Jefferies LLC and TD Securities (USA) LLC, as representative of the several underwriters (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell 14,406,508 shares of the Company's Common Stock and warrants ("Public Offering Warrants") to purchase up to 14,406,508 shares of the Company's Common Stock at an offering price of 1.20 per share and accompanying warrant (the "Public Offering"). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company also granted the Underwriters an option exercisable for 30 days to purchase up to an additional 2,160,976 shares of Common Stock (the "Share Overallotment") and/or 2,160,976 Public Offering Warrants at the public offering price. The Public Offering closed on July 1, 2024 with net proceeds received of 15.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts of 1.0 million and offering costs of 1.0 million.

Further, the Underwriters exercised a portion of the option with respect to the Common Stock on July 5, 2024 for net proceeds of 2.2 million, which resulted in the issuance of 1,927,265 shares of the Company's Common Stock at an offering price of 1.20 per share.

 Although the Company disagrees with ANSM s decision, it is fully cooperating and in active dialogue with the agency regarding the Company's remediation program prioritizing changes related to its advertising strategy, follow-up program and training programs to address ANSM s concerns. The Company is committed to continuing its engagement with ANSM to identify a path that will enable the Company to resume the commercialization of the Allurion Balloon in France. 
 NYSE Continued Listing Standards 
 On August 12, 2024, we received a letter from NYSE notifying us that, as of August 8, 2024, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the average closing price of the Company s common stock was less than 1.00 per share, the minimum average closing bid price required by the continued listing requirements of Rule 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. A company can regain compliance with the minimum share price requirement at any time during the six-month cure period if, on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period, the company has (i) a closing share price of at least 1.00 and (ii) an average closing share price of at least 1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. In the event that at the expiration of the six-month cure period, both a 1.00 closing share price on the last trading day of the cure period and a 1.00 average closing share price over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the cure period are not attained, the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures. We intend to monitor the closing bid price of our Common Stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the NYSE minimum share price requirement. 
 On August 29, 2024, we received written notice from the NYSE that we are not in compliance with the continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE s Listed Company Manual because the average market capitalization of the Company was less than 50.0 million over the consecutive 30 trading-day period ended August 29, 2024 and the Company s last reported stockholders equity as of August 29, 2024 was less than 50.0 million. In accordance with applicable NYSE procedures, we submitted a plan to the NYSE outlining measures designed to regain compliance with the continued listing standard within 18 months of receipt the written notice. If the NYSE accepts our plan, the NYSE will review the Company on a quarterly basis to confirm compliance with the plan. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Operating Results 
 41 

We believe that our performance and future success depend on many factors that present significant opportunities but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Market Acceptance . The growth of our business depends on our ability to gain broader acceptance of our current products by continuing to make health care providers aware of the benefits of our products to generate increased demand and frequency of use, and thus increase our sales. Our ability to grow our business will also depend on our ability to expand our customer base in existing or new target markets. Although we have increased the number of patients treated with our products through our established relationships and focused sales efforts, we cannot provide assurance that our efforts will continue to increase the use of our products. 

Regulatory approval and timing and efficiency of new product introductions . We must successfully obtain timely approvals, maintain regulatory approval, successfully implement any remediation programs required by regulators to resume sales of the Allurion Balloon, and introduce new products that gain acceptance with health care providers. For our sales to grow, we will also need to obtain regulatory approval of our existing product and any new products or modifications/enhancements to our existing products in the markets that we operate in and new markets as applicable. 

Sales force size and effectiveness. The speed at which newly hired salespeople become effective can impact our revenue growth or our costs incurred in anticipation of such growth. We intend to continue to improve and increase performance in our sales and marketing organization, and expand our international programs to help facilitate further adoption of our products as well as broaden awareness of our products to new customers. 

Product and geographic mix; timing. Our financial results, including our gross margins, may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of orders, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the number of available selling days in a particular period, which can be impacted by a number of factors, such as holidays or days of severe inclement weather in a particular geography, the mix of products sold and the geographic mix of where products are sold. 

Operating Segments 
 We operate our business in a single segment and as one reporting unit, which is how our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), our chief executive officer, reviews financial performance and allocates resources. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a regular basis at the consolidated level for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We derive revenue from the sale of the Allurion Balloon to customers, which are either distributors or health care providers. The Allurion Balloon is the foundation of the Allurion Program, a holistic weight loss program that offers patients the opportunity to receive, and clinic and other health care providers the ability to deliver, behavior change assistance through their use of our remote patient support and monitoring tools.

Revenue 
 Revenue decreased 12.8 million, or 71 , to 5.4 million and decreased 18.7 million, or 41 , to 26.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily the result of decreased gastric balloon units sold due to macroeconomic headwinds in certain markets leading to lower re-order rates as distributors and certain accounts adjusted their inventory levels. Additionally, in August 2024, ANSM suspended sales of the Allurion balloon in France, resulting in a 1.2 million reduction to revenue for customer returns of the Allurion Balloon. The decrease in revenue was also attributable to selling less or no product to certain distributors and accounts to manage our credit risk. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue decreased 2.0 million, or 47 , to 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 2.6 million, or 26 , to 7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue was a direct result of decreased gastric balloon units sold, partially offset by an increase in manufacturing expense, as less labor and overhead was absorbed due to lower production volumes. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit decreased 10.9 million, or 78 , to 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 16.1 million, or 46 , to 19.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of an increase in our manufacturing expense, as less labor and overhead was absorbed due to lower production volumes, as well as a decrease in revenue and sales volume of our gastric balloon system. Additionally, in August 2024, ANSM suspended sales of the Allurion balloon in France, resulting in a 1.2 million reduction to revenue for customer returns of the Allurion Balloon. 
 44 

Operating Expenses 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased 8.8 million, or 63 , to 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was the result of a 5.3 million decrease in marketing expenditures driven by a reorganization of our selling and marketing spend focusing on more efficient channels and geographies, a 1.9 million decrease in shipping and logistics expenses, a 1.3 million decrease in salaries and related benefits, a 0.2 million decrease in meeting expenses, and a 0.1 million decrease in travel expenses. 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased 18.1 million, or 50 , to 18.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was the result of a 9.8 million decrease in marketing spend, a 3.4 million decrease in shipping and logistics expenses, a 2.8 million decrease in salaries, related benefits, and consulting costs, a 1.1 million decrease in meeting expenses, and a 0.6 million decrease in travel expenses. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses decreased 4.0 million, or 55 , to 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily the result of a 2.4 million decrease in costs related to the AUDACITY clinical trial as it nears completion, a 1.0 million decrease attributable to salaries and related benefit costs due to lower headcount, and a 0.4 million decrease in outside consulting costs. 
 Research and development expenses decreased 8.4 million, or 39 , to 13.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily the result of a 4.8 million decrease in costs related to the AUDACITY clinical trial as it nears completion, a 2.4 million decrease attributable to salaries and related benefit costs due to lower headcount, and a 0.9 million decrease in outside consulting costs. We expect research and development expenses to continue to decrease in 2024 as our AUDACITY trial progresses toward completion. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 11.9 million, or 63 , to 7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a 4.6 million decrease in stock based compensation as the prior period consisted of a 4.9 million one-time charge as a result of the Business Combination, a 3.4 million decrease in insurance expense as the prior period consisted of a 3.6 million one-time insurance charge related to the Business Combination, a 1.8 million decrease attributable to salaries, benefits, and related costs, a 1.0 million decrease in bad debt expense, and a 0.8 million decrease in legal and professional fees, primarily driven by 1.2 million in one-time charges in the prior period related to the Business Combination. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 9.9 million, or 32 , to 20.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a 4.1 million decrease in stock based compensation as the prior period consisted of a 4.9 million one-time charge as a result of the Business Combination, a 3.9 million decrease in bad debt expense, a 2.9 million decrease in insurance expense as the prior period consisted of a 3.6 million one-time insurance charge related to the Business Combination, partially offset by an increase in director and officer insurance in the current year, and a 0.6 million decrease attributable to salaries, benefits, and related costs. These decreases were partially offset by 1.7 million of legal and professional fees, driven by 1.4 million of one-time legal fees in connection with the Amended Note Purchase Agreement with RTW and 0.9 million of offering costs expensed as part of the Public Offering and Private Placement in July 2024. 
 Other income (expense) 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased 2.6 million, or 100 , to zero for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 5.1 million, or 69 , to 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in interest expense was due the termination of our Fortress Term Loan in April 2024, as well as a reduction in principal of our Fortress Term Loan as compared to our 2021 Term Loan during the comparable nine month period. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrants 
 The 9.7 million gain and 14.2 million gain attributable to the change in fair value of warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, were due to mark to market fluctuations in our warrant liabilities due to the decline in value of our Common Stock during the periods, as well as the issuance of the Public Offering Warrants and Private Placement Warrants on July 1, 2024, for which there were no comparable mark to market fluctuations in the prior period. 
 
 45 

Change in Fair Value of Debt 
 The 1.8 million and 10.0 million gain attributable to the change in fair value of debt for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, was due to mark to market fluctuations in our convertible debt. 
 Change in Fair Value of Revenue Interest Financing and PIPE Conversion Option 
 The 11.1 million loss attributable to the change in fair value of the Revenue Interest Financing and PIPE Conversion Option for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a 6.7 million loss related to the change in fair value of the Revenue Interest Financing and a 4.4 million loss on PIPE Conversion Option primarily driven by a decrease in the discount rate. The 9.6 million loss attributable to the change in fair value of the Revenue Interest Financing and PIPE Conversion Option for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a 5.4 million loss related to the change in fair value in the Revenue Interest Financing from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 and a 4.3 million loss in the change in fair value of the PIPE Conversion Option from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 
 Change in Fair Value of Earn-Out Liabilities 
 The 2.3 million gain attributable to the change in the fair value of earn-out liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the 22.1 million gain attributable to the change in the fair value of the earn-out liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were due to the decrease in the Company's stock price from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt decreased 3.9 million, or 100 , to zero for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to a 3.9 million loss on the extinguishment of the 2021 Term Loan with Runway during the comparable period. Loss on extinguishment of debt increased 4.8 million, or 122 , to 8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was due to the 8.7 million loss on extinguishment of our Fortress Term Loan in April 2024, compared to the 3.9 million loss on the extinguishment of our 2021 Term Loan with Runway in August 2023. 
 Termination of convertible note side letters 
 Termination of convertible note side letters decreased 9.5 million, or 100 , to zero for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 17.6 million, or 100 , to zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases were primarily due to changes in the PubCo Share Liability, Base PubCo Shares and Backstop Shares liabilities driven by the use of the full backstop during the comparable periods for which there were no comparable liabilities in the current period. 
 Other Income, Net 
 The change in Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was a gain of 0.4 million attributable to a 0.4 million gain related to fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies. The change in Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was a gain of 1.8 million, primarily driven by the 2.1 million write-off of the term loan derivative liability to zero in connection with the termination of the Fortress Term Loan and a 1.1 million gain in interest income, partially offset by a 1.1 million loss related to the Amended Note Purchase Agreement. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 We recorded a provision for income taxes of 0.1 million and 0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These provisions for income taxes are due to net income in certain foreign jurisdictions. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have primarily obtained cash to fund our operations through the sale of Allurion preferred stock and common stock, issuance of term loans, royalty arrangements, and issuance of convertible debt instruments. As of September 30, 2024, we had 28.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. We incurred a net loss of 5.6 million and 61.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We incurred cash outflows from operating activities of 29.0 million and 43.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 218.4 million. We expect to continue to generate significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the emergence of competing innovative weight loss experiences and other adverse marketing developments; 

the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and research and development expenditures; and 

any investments or acquisitions we may choose to pursue in the future. 

46 

Our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 26.5 million, which represented a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 41 . The decrease in revenue was primarily the result of lower re-order rates as distributors and certain accounts adjusted their inventory levels. The decrease in revenue was also attributable to selling less or no product to certain distributors and accounts to manage our credit risk. Additionally, in August 2024, ANSM suspended sales of the Allurion balloon in France, resulting in a reduction to revenue for customer returns of the Allurion Balloon. If our current cash and anticipated revenue and resulting cash flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, due to increased expenditures, lower demand for or sales of our gastric balloon system, the occurrence of other events or the realization of the risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or our Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors," we may be required to raise additional capital through the issuances of public or private equity or debt financing or other capital sources earlier than expected. 
 Until such time as we can generate sufficient revenue to fund operations, we expect to use proceeds from the issuance of equity, debt financings, or other capital transactions to fund our operations and satisfy our liquidity requirements. We may be unable to increase our revenue, successfully complete remediation programs to resume sales of the Allurion Balloon, raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to increase our revenue, successfully complete remediation programs to resume sales of the Allurion Balloon, raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue our operations or the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates and other strategic initiatives. Based on our recurring losses from operations incurred since inception, the expectation of continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future, and the potential need to raise additional capital to finance our future operations and debt service payments, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are issued. 
 Financing Arrangements 
 Public Offering and Concurrent Private Placement 
 On July 1, 2024, we received 15.2 million in net proceeds from the issuance of 14,406,508 shares of Common Stock and 16,567,484 Public Offering Warrants and 2.5 million in net proceeds from the sale and issuance of 2,260,159 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 2,260,159 Private Placement Warrants in the Private Placement, in each case at an offering price of 1.20 per share and accompanying warrant.

 Chardan Purchase Agreement 
 On December 18, 2023, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Chardan. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we have the right from time to time at our option to sell to Chardan up to the lesser of (i) 100,000,000 in aggregate gross purchase price of newly issued shares of our Common Stock, and (ii) the Exchange Cap, subject to certain conditions.

We entered into the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement on February 9, 2023 and received the proceeds at the closing of the Business Combination. On April 14, 2024, the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement was amended to, among other things, increase the rate of revenue interest payments to be paid to RTW. The Revenue Interest Financing Agreement is included in Revenue Interest Financing liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. See Note 9, Revenue Interest Financing, Side Letter, and PIPE Conversion Option in the notes to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details regarding the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement. 
 On October 22, 2024, funds affiliated with RTW provided notice to the Company of their election under the RTW Side Letter, to surrender 749,998 shares of common stock of the Company representing 7.5 million in consideration for an additional Revenue 
 47 

Interest Financing Agreement. Accordingly, on October 30, 2024, the Company and the funds affiliated with RTW entered into the New RIFA. 
 Material Cash Requirements for Known Contractual and Other Obligations 
 Leases 
 We have entered into various non-cancellable operating leases for our corporate office, manufacturing facilities, research and development labs, management office space and certain equipment. The leases have varying terms expiring between 2025 and 2028. See Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for additional details related to our noncancelable operating leases. 
 RTW Convertible Notes 
 On April 16, 2024, we received 48 million in gross proceeds from the Amended Note Purchase Agreement with RTW, which proceeds were used to repay all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and other obligations with respect to the Fortress Term Loan. 
 Revenue Interest Financing 
 We received 40.0 million in proceeds from the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement with RTW on August 1, 2023. In exchange, we are obligated to remit to RTW certain revenue interest payments on all current and future products, digital solutions and services developed, imported, manufactured, marketed, offered for sale, promoted, sold, tested or otherwise distributed by Allurion and its subsidiaries at certain specified rates. On April 14, 2024, the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement was amended to, among other things, increase the rate of revenue interest payments to be paid to RTW for net sales less than or equal to 100 million prior to December 31, 2026 from 6 to 12 , and increase the royalty rate on net sales less than or equal to 100 million on or after January 1, 2027 from 10 to 12 . 
 If RTW has not received aggregate revenue interest payments equal to at least 100 of the Investment Amount by December 31, 2027, we must make a cash payment in an amount sufficient to catch RTW up to 100 of the Investment Amount. If RTW has not received revenue interest payments equal to at least 240 of the Investment Amount by December 31, 2030, we must make a cash payment in an amount sufficient to catch RTW up to 240 of the Investment Amount. 
 Further, on October 22, 2024, funds affiliated with RTW provided notice to the Company of their election under the RTW Side Letter, to surrender 749,998 shares of common stock of the Company representing 7,500,000 in consideration for an additional Revenue Interest Financing Agreement. Accordingly, on October 30, 2024, the Company and the funds affiliated with RTW entered into the New RIFA. The New RIFA has substantially identical terms and conditions as the RIFA Amendment, except that the amount of financing provided under the New RIFA is equal to the conversion amount of 7.5 million. 
 Research and Development Costs 
 We are continuing to invest in our U.S. FDA AUDACITY clinical trial and have entered into contractual obligations with each clinical trial site. Each contract shall continue until the completion of the trial at that site, which is approximately 48 weeks from the start of each contract. Our clinical trial costs are dependent on, among other things, the size, number, and length of our clinical trial. We also incur research and development costs related to the enhancement of our existing products. 
 Other Capital Requirements 
 We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with various vendors, which are generally cancelable upon notice. Payments due upon cancellation typically consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of service providers, up to the date of cancellation.

 Non-cash income consisted of 22.1 million of income related to the change in fair value of our earn-out liabilities, 14.2 million of mark to market adjustments related to our warrant liabilities, 10.0 million of income related to the change in fair value of our convertible debt, 2.5 million of interest paid on debt recorded at fair value, and 1.9 million of income related to the change in fair value of our term loan derivative liability. This non-cash income was partially offset by a 9.6 million loss on the change in fair value of our Revenue Interest Financing and PIPE Conversion Option, an 8.7 million loss on the extinguishment of our Fortress Term Loan, 2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, 1.5 million of non-cash interest expense, 1.4 million of debt issuance costs associated with debt at fair value, a 1.1 million provision for uncollectible accounts, a 1.1 million provision for inventory, 0.9 million of issuance costs associated with warrants recorded at fair value, 0.8 million of depreciation and amortization expense, and 0.6 million of non-cash lease expense. 
 Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities consisted of a 7.2 million decrease in accounts receivable, a 0.6 million decrease in inventory, and a 0.7 million decrease in prepaid expenses, other current and long-term assets, partially offset by a net 8.4 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a 0.6 million decrease in our lease liabilities. 
 The decrease in accounts receivable was the result of an increase in cash collections and decrease in revenue. The decrease in inventory was primarily related to a decrease in finished goods and work in progress. The decrease in prepaid expenses, other current and long-term assets was primarily related to a decrease in prepaid inventory and payroll deposits. The net decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily related to decreased expenses and timing of payments. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating activities used 43.1 million of cash, resulting from a net loss of 61.4 million, partially offset by net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 3.4 million and non-cash charges of 14.9 million. 
 Non-cash charges consisted of 16.1 million for termination of convertible note side letters, 6.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, a 5.0 million provision for uncollectible accounts, 3.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt for our 2021 Term Loan, 3.8 million related to the change in fair value of our convertible debt, 2.0 million related to the change in fair value of the Revenue Interest Financing and PIPE Conversion Option, 1.1 million of non-cash interest expense primarily related to the accretion of debt discount associated with our outstanding debt arrangements, a 0.7 million provision for inventory, 0.6 million of lease expense, 0.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense, and 0.3 million of unrealized loss on foreign exchange. These charges were partially offset by 24.3 million of income related to the change in fair value of our earn-out liabilities and 2.4 million of mark to market adjustments related to our warrant and derivative liabilities. 
 Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities consisted of a net 8.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a 0.4 million decrease in prepaid expenses, other current and long-term assets, partially offset by a 3.9 million increase in accounts receivable, a 0.9 million increase in inventory and a 0.6 million decrease in operating lease liabilities. 
 The net increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily related to increased expenses as well as timing of payments. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily related to the timing of cash collections. The decrease in prepaid expenses, other current and long-term assets was primarily related to the settlement of deferred deal costs related to the Business Combination. The increase in inventory was primarily related to an increase in work in progress and raw materials. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities was 0.6 million and 1.2 million, respectively, consisting of purchases of property and equipment. 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was 20.3 million, consisting of 48.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, 18.2 million in net proceeds from the Public Offering, 2.7 million in net proceeds from the Private Placement, and 0.4 million of proceeds from our equity line financing, partially offset by 47.7 million repayment of the Fortress Term Loan and a 1.4 million payment of debt issuance costs. 
 49 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was 116.4 million, consisting of 62.1 million of proceeds from the Business Combination, net of transaction costs, 57.6 million from the issuance of our Fortress Term Loan net of debt issuance costs, 38.8 million from the issuance of our Revenue Interest Financing Agreement with RTW net of issuance costs, 28.7 million from the issuance of our 2023 Convertible Notes, net of issuance costs, partially offset by the 57.7 million repayment of our 2021 Term Loan, 10.8 million repayment of our 2023 Convertible Notes and 2.5 million of repayment of a promissory note assumed from Compute Health in the Business Combination. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 or ASC 606 ). In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenue when control of our products is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Our revenue recognition process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue as performance obligations are satisfied. 
 Revenue is generated primarily from the sale of our gastric balloon system, which includes the Allurion Balloon and related accessories. We have provided customers purchasing the Allurion Balloon with an implied license for access to our Allurion VCS software. This implied software license was given to customers for no additional consideration and was not negotiated as part of the customer s contracts. As such, it has been deemed an immaterial promise in the context of the contract, and we do not consider the license as a separate performance obligation. In the future, if and when Allurion VCS services are determined to be a performance obligation, we expect the associated consideration will be deferred and recognized over the license period. 
 We sell our products directly to customers through our direct sales personnel and indirectly through independent distributors. For distributor sales, we sell our products to our distributors, who subsequently resell the products to health care providers, among others. For direct sales, our products are sold directly to our customers, which are typically health care providers. Generally, customer contracts contain Free on Board or Ex-Works shipping point incoterms. We recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of our product, which typically occurs upon shipment, in return for agreed-upon, fixed-price consideration. 
 Additionally, from time to time, we offer certain incentives to our customers, which are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. Any discounts we offer are outlined in our customer agreements. Payments to the customer for a distinct good or service that reasonably estimates the fair value of the distinct benefit received, such as marketing programs and shipping and logistics services, are recorded as a selling and marketing expense. 
 Our payment terms are consistent with prevailing practice in the respective markets in which we do business, which are not affected by contingent events that could impact the transaction price. Our contracts with customers do not provide general rights of return unless certain product quality standards are not met. 
 Valuation of Earn-Out Liabilities 
 In connection with the Business Combination, holders of Legacy Allurion common stock and Legacy Allurion preferred stock and holders of vested options, warrants and restricted stock units exercisable or convertible into Legacy Allurion capital stock received the contingent right to receive additional shares of our Common Stock (the Earn-Out Shares upon the achievement of certain earn-out targets. As the contingent earn-out consideration contains a settlement provision that precludes it from being indexed to our stock, it is classified as a liability under ASC 480, as defined in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . The fair value of contingent earn-out consideration is estimated as of the acquisition date at the present value of the expected contingent payments using a Monte Carlo Simulation Method. This method utilizes a combination of observable (Level 2) and unobservable (Level 3) inputs, which include the trading price and volatility of the underlying common stock, expected term, risk-free interest rates, and expected date of a qualifying event. The determination of the fair value of these financial instruments is complex and highly 
 50 

judgmental due to the significant estimation required. In particular, the fair value estimate is sensitive to certain assumptions, such as the volatility of underlying shares. 
 Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration are recorded in Other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and are reflected in the period in which they are identified. Changes in the estimated fair value of the continent earn-out consideration may materially impact or cause volatility in our operating results. 
 Valuation of Revenue Interest Financing and PIPE Conversion Option 
 In connection with the Business Combination, we entered into the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement with RTW, under which the Company received 40.0 million upfront. In exchange, we are obligated to remit to RTW certain revenue interest payments on all current and future products, digital solutions and services developed, imported, manufactured, marketed, offered for sale, promoted, sold, tested or otherwise distributed by Allurion and its subsidiaries until December 31, 2030. We account for the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement under the fair value option election of ASC 825, Financial Instruments . The Revenue Interest Financing Agreement accounted for under the FVO election is a debt host financial instrument containing embedded features wherein the entire financial instrument is initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and then subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. The fair value of the Revenue Interest Financing is calculated using a discounted cash flow method under the income approach utilizing future revenue projections and a discount rate. Changes in the estimated fair value of the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement are recorded as a component of Other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. A portion of the estimated change in fair value must be reported in other comprehensive loss to the extent that it is attributable to instrument-specific credit risk. As a result of electing the FVO, direct costs and fees related to the Revenue Interest Financing are expensed as incurred. 
 In connection with the Company entering into the Revenue Interest Financing, we and RTW entered into the RTW Side Letter under which RTW may elect to convert up to 7.5 million of its initial PIPE subscription into an additional revenue interest financing by forfeiting a number of shares of our Common Stock acquired by the RTW in its PIPE Investment. We account for this PIPE Conversion Option as a freestanding financial instrument that qualifies for derivative liability accounting in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The fair value of the PIPE Conversion Option is measured using a MCSM using a combination of observable (Level 2) and unobservable (Level 3) inputs, which include the number of shares convertible, the stock price of the underlying common stock, volatility, risk-free rates, and expected term. The PIPE Conversion Option is initially measured at its fair value within Other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets with corresponding recognition of expense at inception as there is no right received by the Company that meets the definition of an asset and the transaction did not involve a distribution or a dividend. Subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative liability are recognized as a gain or loss as a component of Other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Valuation of RTW Convertible Notes 
 We entered into the Amended Note Purchase Agreement with RTW on April 16, 2024, under which the Company issued and sold 48.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior secured notes. We account for the RTW Convertible Notes under the FVO election of ASC 825, as the Amended Note Purchase Agreement is a financial instrument containing embedded features where the entire financial instrument is measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and then subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. The fair value of the RTW Convertible Notes is measured using a discounted cash flow method under the income approach with a MCSM used to determine the simulated stock price at each payment date and event that may trigger conversion of the RTW Convertible Notes. The fair value is measured using a combination of observable (Level 2) and unobservable (Level 3) inputs, which include probabilities of various conversion scenarios, volatility, estimated market yields, and expected term. The determination of the fair value of the RTW Convertible Notes is complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required. 
 Changes in the estimated fair value of the RTW Convertible Notes are recorded in Other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and are reflected in the period in which they are identified. 
 Determination of Fair Value of Legacy Allurion Preferred Stock, Common Stock and Warrants 
 The estimated fair value of our Legacy Allurion shares has been determined by the Legacy Allurion board of directors, with input from management, considering the most recently available third-party valuations then available and the Legacy Allurion board of directors' assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant. These factors included, but were not limited to: 
 the prices at which we sold shares of Legacy Allurion preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences of the Legacy Allurion preferred stock relative to the Legacy Allurion common stock at the time of each grant; 

our stage of development and business strategy; 

external market conditions and trends affecting our industry; 

51 

our financial position, including cash on hand, and our historical and forecasted performance and operating results; 

the lack of an active public market for our Common Stock and our preferred stock; 

the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering, deSPAC transaction, or sale of our company in light of prevailing market conditions; and 

the analysis of initial public offerings or other financing transactions and market performance of comparable companies in the industry. 

The fair value of the underlying Legacy Allurion preferred stock, common stock, and warrants was determined by the Legacy Allurion board of directors until we were listed on the NYSE on August 2, 2023. The fair value of the Legacy Allurion shares is utilized in the determination of stock-based compensation expense, common stock warrant liability expense, preferred stock recorded at fair value and the convertible notes conversion price. The assumptions underlying these valuations represented management s best estimates, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment. As a result, if we had used significantly different assumptions or estimates, the fair value of the Legacy Allurion preferred stock issued in 2021 and Legacy Allurion Convertible Notes converted in 2021 could be materially different. Significantly different assumptions or estimates could also impact the fair value of the Legacy Allurion Stock Options and stock-based compensation and fair value of the Legacy Allurion warrants, but these have not been material to date. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2, Summary of Significant of Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act JOBS Act ). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that (i) we are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We may choose to early adopt any new or revised accounting standards whenever such early adoption is permitted for private companies. 
 Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, which allows us to take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (i) the market value of the shares of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 250 million as of the prior June 30, and (ii) our annual revenue exceeded 100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of the shares of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.

Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We had cash and cash equivalents totaling 28.7 million at September 30, 2024. Cash equivalents were invested primarily in money market funds. Our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity needs. Under our investment policy, we invest in highly rated securities, issued by the U.S. government or liquid money market funds. We do not invest in financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. We utilize external investment managers who adhere to the guidelines of our investment policy. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of our cash, cash equivalents, net loss or cash flows. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no variable rate debt outstanding. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include transaction gains and losses associated with transactions denominated in currencies other than a location s functional currency and the remeasurement of foreign currencies to our U.S. dollar reporting currency. As such, we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with operating expenses of our foreign operations. Transaction gains or losses are included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations, as incurred. 
 We believe that a 10 increase or decrease in current exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and our foreign currencies could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our primary exposures related to foreign currency denominated sales and expenses are in Europe and we also have exposure in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, and are monitoring potential developing exposure in the Latin American, Canadian and African markets. 
 To date, we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to managing the risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effect of an immediate 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates on foreign-denominated accounts would have had an impact of approximately 6 on revenues and 2 on expenses and would have impacted our net income by approximately 2 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effect of an immediate 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates on foreign-denominated accounts would have had an impact of approximately 5 on revenues and 2 on expenses and would have impacted our net loss by approximately 1 . 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that review and evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below. 
 In connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we are currently working to remediate, which relate to: (a) insufficient segregation of duties in the financial statement close process; (b) a lack of sufficient levels of staff with public company and technical accounting experience to maintain proper control activities and perform risk assessment and monitoring activities; and (c) insufficient information systems controls, including access and change management controls. We have concluded that these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting occurred because we did not have the necessary business processes, personnel and related internal controls to operate in a manner to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting timeline requirements of a public company. 
 We are focused on designing and implementing effective internal controls measures to improve our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, and remediating the material weaknesses. In order to remediate these material weaknesses, we have taken and plan to take the following actions: 
 
 53 

the hiring and planned continued hiring of additional accounting staff with public company experience, 

implemented a new enterprise resource planning system to replace the prior enterprise resource planning system, 

implementation of additional review controls and processes requiring timely account reconciliation and analyses of certain transactions and accounts, and 

hired a national accounting firm to assist in the design and implementation of controls and remediation of controls gaps. 

While significant progress has been made to enhance our internal control over financial reporting, we are still in the process of building and enhancing our processes, procedures, and controls. Additional time is required to complete the remediation of these material weaknesses and the assessment to ensure the sustainability of these remediation actions. We believe the above actions, when complete, will be effective in the remediation of the material weakness described above. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 54 

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. 
 Ite m 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Information regarding risk factors appears in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024 and subsequently amended on April 29, 2024 (the Annual Report on Form 10-K ). You should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, under the heading Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors, together with the additional risk factors included below and all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in such Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to the matters set forth herein, investors should review the risks factors and other information provided in the Annual Report on Form 10-K prior to making an investment in the Company. The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below and in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial conditions and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. 
 
 We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future, our ability to achieve and maintain profitability depends on the commercial success of the Allurion Balloon, and we expect our revenues to continue to be driven primarily by sales of the Allurion Balloon. 
 We have incurred losses to date and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Sales of the Allurion Balloon and related accessories, which have occurred outside of the U.S. because we have not yet obtained the regulatory approval required to sell our products within the U.S., accounted for substantially all of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and we expect our revenues to continue to be driven primarily by sales of the Allurion Balloon. In order to achieve and sustain profitability, our revenues from sales of the Allurion Balloon will need to grow beyond the levels we have achieved in the past. If health care providers and/or patients do not perceive our products to be competitive in features, efficacy and safety when compared to other products in the market, or if demand for the Allurion Balloon or for weight loss procedures and programs in general decreases, we may fail to achieve sales levels that provide for future profitability. 
 Our ability to successfully market and sell the Allurion Balloon and our other current and future product and service offerings depends on numerous factors, including but not limited to: 
 outcomes of current and future clinical trials of, and trials involving, the Allurion Balloon; 

acceptance of the Allurion Balloon as safe and effective by patients, caregivers and the medical community; 

an acceptable safety profile of the Allurion Balloon in markets where we have obtained regulatory approvals; 

our ability to successfully complete remediation programs to resume sales of the Allurion Balloon in France and any other country that suspends sales of our products; 

whether key thought leaders in the medical community accept that such clinical trials are sufficiently meaningful to influence their or their patients choices of product; 

maintenance of our existing regulatory approvals and expansion of the geographies in which we have regulatory approvals; 

commercially viable processes at a scale sufficient to meet anticipated demand at an adequate cost of manufacturing, and that are compliant with ISO 13485 Quality Management System requirements and/or good manufacturing practice requirements, as set forth in the FDA s QSR and other international regulations; 

our success in educating health care providers and patients about the benefits, administration and use of the Allurion Balloon; 

the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments; 

55 

the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket for the Allurion Balloon and/or VCS in the absence of coverage and reimbursement for such treatment; 

the success of our internal sales and marketing organization and the sales forces of our distributors; and 

continued demand for weight loss using balloon products, which may be adversely affected by events involving our products or those of our competitors, among other things. 

Some of these factors are beyond our control. For example, on August 6, 2024, we announced that the ANSM suspended sales of the Allurion Balloon in France, and that we are withdrawing the Allurion Balloon from the French market, pending implementation of a remediation plan to reduce certain risks associated with the advertising, follow-up program, and adverse events for the Allurion Balloon. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement a remediation plan to the satisfaction of ANSM and we could be delayed or prevented from resuming sales of the Allurion Balloon in France. In addition, a withdrawal from the market in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process and ability to sell and commercialize the Allurion Balloon in other countries, and on the market acceptance of the Allurion Balloon. Any of these events may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 
 If we are unable to continue to commercialize the Allurion Balloon and our other current and future products and services, or are unable to obtain a distributor or partner to commercialize them, we may not be able to produce any incremental revenues related to the Allurion Balloon and our other current and future products and services. This would result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 
 The failure of the Allurion Balloon to achieve and maintain market acceptance could result in us achieving sales below our expectations, which would cause our business, financial condition and operating results to be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our current business and growth strategy is highly dependent on the Allurion Balloon achieving and maintaining market acceptance. In order for us to sell our products to healthcare providers and, ultimately, weight loss patients, we must convince them that our products are an attractive alternative to competitive treatments for patients who are obese and overweight, including traditional pharmaceutical therapies and more aggressive bariatric surgical treatments, such as gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Market acceptance and adoption of the Allurion Balloon depends on educating health care providers on its safe and appropriate use, as well as the cost, safety, comfort, tolerability, ease of use, and effectiveness of the Allurion Program compared to other treatments. If we are not successful in convincing existing and potential customers of the benefits of our product, or if we are not able to achieve the support of health care providers for our product, our sales may decline or we may achieve sales below our expectations. 
 Market acceptance of our products could be negatively impacted by many factors, including: 
 the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket for the Allurion Program in the absence of coverage and reimbursement for such program; 

the failure of our products to achieve and maintain wide acceptance among patients who are obese and overweight, their health care providers, third-party payors and key opinion leaders in the weight loss treatment community; 

lack of evidence supporting the safety, ease-of-use or other perceived benefits of the Allurion Balloon over competitive products or other currently available weight loss treatment alternatives; 

perceived risks or uncertainties, or actual adverse events or other undesirable side effects, associated with the use of our gastric balloons, or components thereof, or of similar products or technologies of our competitors; 

any adverse legal action, including products liability litigation, against us or our competitors relating to the Allurion Balloon or similar products or technologies; 

the withdrawal or modification of any regulatory approvals for our products (including the withdrawal of the Allurion Balloon from the French market in August 2024); and 

results of clinical studies relating to the Allurion Balloon or similar competitive products. 

In addition, the rapid evolution of technology and treatment options within our industry may cause consumers to delay the purchase of our products in anticipation of advancements or breakthroughs, or the perception that advancements or breakthroughs could occur, in our products or the products offered by our competitors. It is also possible that consumers interested in purchasing any of our future products currently under development may delay the purchase of one of our current products. In addition, customers may delay their purchasing decisions, or health care providers may refrain from providing our products, as a result of a global pandemic or unfavorable changes in general economic conditions. 
 If the Allurion Balloon, or any other therapy or product that we may develop, does not achieve and maintain widespread market acceptance, we may fail to achieve sales consistent with our projections, in which case our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 
 56 

There is no guarantee that the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory agencies will grant approval or clearance for our current or future products, including the Allurion Balloon. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances in the United States and other international jurisdictions, or revocation of approvals or clearances in those jurisdictions, will prevent us from marketing our products in such jurisdictions. 
 
 We intend to seek regulatory approval or clearance of our current and future products in the United States and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. We have obtained a CE Mark for the Allurion Balloon and are therefore authorized to sell in the EU; however, in order to market in regions such as the United States, the Asia Pacific region and many other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals or clearances. 
 
 The procedures for approval vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, and the time required to obtain approval or clearance may differ from that required to obtain the CE Mark or FDA approval. As a result of the United Kingdom leaving the EU, since January 1, 2021, the regulatory framework and regimes for medical devices in the United Kingdom and the EU have diverged. In particular, a new UKCA Mark was introduced for medical devices placed on the Great Britain market (which includes England, Scotland and Wales), and Northern Ireland adopted a hybrid approach as a result of the divergence in accordance with the Northern Ireland Protocol. Of note, on June 30, 2023, the UK Government introduced legislation, confirming that, subject to certain conditions, general medical devices compliant with the MDD with a valid declaration and CE mark can be placed on the Great Britain market up until the sooner of the expiry of the CE certificate or June 30, 2028, and general medical devices compliant with the MDR with a valid declaration and CE mark can be placed on the Great Britain market up until June 30, 2030. 
 
 Moreover, clinical studies or manufacturing processes conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more international regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. An international regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to submit for regulatory approvals or clearances and even if we submit we may not receive necessary approvals or clearances to commercialize our products in any market. 
 
 Before obtaining regulatory approval or clearance for the sale of a product, we may be required to conduct extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our planned products in human patients. Preclinical studies and clinical trials can be expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and are uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of our trials could occur at any stage of testing. In connection with the initiation of a clinical trial in the U.S., we filed an investigational device exemption application, which was approved by the FDA in 2016. After we conducted that trial and submitted a premarket approval application to the FDA, in 2020, the FDA requested additional data. Therefore, we withdrew the PMA and in 2021 submitted an IDE application for our AUDACITY trial, which the FDA approved in 2021. We are currently conducting that clinical trial. 
 
 Numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical and clinical trials could occur, which would delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize the Allurion Balloon or any of our future products, including the following: 
 preclinical studies and clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional studies or abandon product development programs; 

the number of patients required for clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be insufficient or slower than we anticipate, or patients may drop out of these clinical studies at a higher rate than we anticipate; 

the cost of preclinical studies and clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate; 

third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all; 

we might suspend or terminate clinical trials of our products for various reasons, including a finding that our products have unanticipated serious side effects or other unexpected characteristics, or that the trial subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; 

regulators may not approve our proposed clinical development plans; 

regulators or independent institutional review boards ("IRBs") may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; 

57 

regulators or IRBs may require that we, or our investigators, suspend or terminate clinical studies for various reasons, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements; 

regulators in countries where our products are currently marketed may require that we suspend commercial distribution if there is non-compliance with regulatory requirements or safety concerns; 

the supply or quality of our products or other materials necessary to conduct clinical studies of our products may be insufficient or inadequate; and 

the enactment of new regulatory requirements in the EU under the Medical Device Regulation ("MDR") effective since May 26, 2021 may make approval times longer and standards more difficult to pass. In particular, manufacturers are required to: (i) assign a unique device identification UDI to a medical device before it is placed on the EU market in order to improve traceability of the medical device; and (ii) register themselves, the medical device and the UDI, among other things, with a new European medical device database. 

If we or any future collaboration or distribution partner are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of the Allurion Balloon or any future products, those clinical studies or other testing may not be successfully completed. If the results of these studies or tests are not positive, or are only modestly positive or if they raise safety concerns, we may: 
 be delayed in obtaining marketing approvals for the Allurion Balloon or our future products; 

not obtain marketing approval at all; 

obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as desired; 

have a product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval; or 

be subject to restrictions on how the product is distributed or used. 

Even if we obtain regulatory approvals or clearances in a jurisdiction, our products may be removed from the market due to a variety of factors, including adverse events, recalls, suspension of regulatory clearance to sell, or other factors. For example, on August 6, 2024, we announced that ANSM has suspended sales of the Allurion Balloon in France, and we are withdrawing the Allurion Balloon from the French market, pending implementation of a remediation plan to reduce certain risks associated with the advertising, follow-up program, and adverse events for the Allurion Balloon. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement a remediation plan to the satisfaction of ANSM and we could be delayed or prevented from resuming sales of the Allurion Balloon in France. A withdrawal from the market in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process and ability to sell and commercialize the Allurion Balloon in other countries, and on the market acceptance of the Allurion Balloon in other countries. 
 
 Although we launched the Allurion Balloon commercially in January 2016 and have placed over 150,000 units to date in various countries outside the U.S., we do not have as much post-market surveillance data as our competitors and may not have clearly identified all possible or actual risks of our products. Furthermore, if our clinical trials do not produce patient data that compares favorably with products that are already on the market, health care providers and patients may opt not to use our products, and our business would suffer. 
 
 Our product development costs will also increase if we experience delays to our clinical trials or approvals. 
 
 Significant clinical trial delays also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which would impair our ability to commercialize our products and harm our business and results of operations. 
 Negative publicity, product defects and any resulting litigation concerning our products or our competitors products could harm our reputation and reduce demand for the Allurion Balloon, either of which could negatively impact our financial results. 
 The responses of potential patients, health care providers, the media, legislative and regulatory bodies and others to information about complications or alleged complications of our products, or products liability litigation against us or our competitors, could result in negative publicity and could materially reduce market acceptance of our products. These responses or any investigations and potential resulting negative publicity may have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, significant negative publicity could result in an increased number of product liability claims against us. On August 6, 2024, the ANSM has suspended sales of the Allurion Balloon in France due to adverse events, and we withdrew the Allurion Balloon from the French market, pending implementation of a remediation plan. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement a remediation plan to the satisfaction of ANSM 
 58 

and we could be delayed or prevented from resuming sales of the Allurion Balloon in France. A withdrawal from the market in in France and the risks identified by ANSM could negatively affect the market acceptance of the Allurion Balloon. 
 If patients using our products experience adverse events or other undesirable side effects, regulatory authorities could withdraw or modify our regulatory approvals, which would adversely affect our reputation and commercial prospects and/or result in other significant negative consequences. 
 Undesirable side effects caused by the Allurion Balloon could cause us, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and could result in more restrictive labeling than originally required, cause the FDA or other regulatory authorities to subsequently withdraw or modify our PMA, if we obtain approval, or other regulatory approvals, or result in the delay or denial of regulatory approval by regulatory authorities. For example, we suspended sales of the Allurion Balloon in France following a request by the ANSM, due to adverse events linked to gastrointestinal complications. In addition, in the 1980s and early 1990s, the FDA required post-market safety and efficacy data be collected on an earlier version of an intragastric balloon after patients suffered severe side effects and complications with the device, which ultimately resulted in the withdrawal of the PMA approval. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had sold over 130,000 units of the Allurion Balloon in international markets. In our commercial experience, the serious adverse event rate has been less than 0.2 and has been similar to the SAE profile reported in the literature. 
 If we are unable to demonstrate that any adverse events are not related to our product, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, require more restrictive indications for use and/or additional warnings, precautions and/or contraindications in the labeling than originally required, or delay or deny approval of any of our products. Even if we are able to do so, such event(s) could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to not initiate, delay, suspend or terminate any future clinical trial of any of our products, the commercial prospects of such product may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from our product may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to develop other products, and may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. 
 In addition, we or others may later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product (or any other similar product), resulting in potentially significant consequences, including: 
 regulatory authorities may withdraw or limit their approval of the product; 

regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a contraindication; 

we may be required to change the way the product is distributed or administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product; 

we may be required to correct or remove the product from the marketplace or decide to conduct a voluntary recall; 

we may decide to alert physicians through customer notifications; 

regulatory authorities may use publicity such as a press release to alert our customers and the public of the issue; 

health care providers and patients may be dissatisfied, seek refunds and refuse to use our products; 

we could be sued and held liable for injury caused to individuals using our product; and 

our reputation may suffer. 

Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the Allurion Balloon and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product and significantly impact our ability to successfully commercialize our product and generate product sales. 
 
 We are not in compliance with the NYSE s minimum share price requirement or its minimum market capitalization standard and thus are at risk of the NYSE delisting shares of our Common Stock, which would have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of shares of our Common Stock. 
 
 On August 12, 2024, we received a letter from NYSE notifying us that, as of August 8, 2024, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the average closing price of our common stock had closed below 1.00 per share, the minimum average closing bid price required by the continued listing requirements of Rule 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Pursuant to Rule 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, a company will be considered to be below compliance standards if the average closing price of a security fell below 1.00 over a period of 30 consecutive trading days. A company can regain compliance with the minimum share 
 59 

price requirement at any time during the six-month cure period if, on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period, the company has (i) a closing share price of at least 1.00 and (ii) an average closing share price of at least 1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. In the event that at the expiration of the six-month cure period, both a 1.00 closing share price on the last trading day of the cure period and a 1.00 average closing share price over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the cure period are not attained, the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures. We intend to monitor the closing bid price of our Common Stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the NYSE minimum share price requirement. 
 
 On August 29, 2024, we received a notice from the NYSE notifying us that as of August 29, 2024, we are not in compliance with the continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE s Listed Company Manual (the Minimum Market Capitalization Standard because our average market capitalization was less than 50.0 million over the consecutive 30 trading-day period ended August 29, 2024 and our last reported stockholders equity as of August 29, 2024 was less than 50.0 million. In accordance with applicable NYSE procedures, within 45 days of receipt of the notice, we submitted a plan to the NYSE advising it of outlining measures that would bring us into conformity with the Minimum Market Capitalization Standard within 18 months of receipt of the notice (the Cure Period ). The NYSE will evaluate the plan and determine whether the Company has made a reasonable demonstration of its ability to come into conformity with the relevant listing standards within the Cure Period. If the NYSE accepts our plan, the NYSE will review us on a quarterly basis to confirm compliance with the plan. If our plan is not accepted, we fail to comply with the plan or we do not meet the Minimum Market Capitalization Standard at the end of the Cure Period, we will be subject to NYSE s prompt initiation of suspension and delisting procedures. 
 
 We cannot assure you that we will be able to cure these deficiencies or comply with other NYSE continued listing standards. A delisting of shares of our Common Stock from the NYSE could negatively impact us as it would likely reduce the liquidity and market price of shares of our Common Stock, reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire shares of our Common Stock, and negatively impact our ability to access equity markets and obtain financing. 
 
 An active trading market may not develop or be sustained. 
 
 The market for our securities may be highly volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance. An active public market for our securities may not develop or be sustained. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in Allurion will lead to the development of an active trading market in our Common Stock or how liquid that market might become. If an active market does not develop or is not sustained, or if we fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of the NYSE for any reason and our securities are delisted, it may be difficult for you to sell your securities at the time you wish to sell them, at a price that is attractive to you, or at all. An inactive trading market may also impair our ability to both raise capital by selling shares of capital stock, attract and motivate employees through equity incentive awards and acquire other companies, products or technologies by using shares of capital stock as consideration. 
 
 On August 12, 2024, we received a letter from NYSE notifying us that, as of August 8, 2024, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the average closing price of our common stock had closed below 1.00 per share, the minimum average closing bid price required by the continued listing requirements of Rule 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. We cannot assure you that we will be able to cure this deficiency or comply with other NYSE continued listing standards. A delisting of shares of our Common Stock from the NYSE could negatively impact us as it would likely reduce the liquidity and market price of shares of our Common Stock. 
 
 We have a significant amount of debt, which may affect our ability to operate our business and secure additional financing in the future. 
 On April 16, 2024, we issued an aggregate principal amount of 48 million of Notes due April 16, 2031. The interest rate is fixed at 6.00 per annum and is payable quarterly in cash or, at our option, in kind for the first three years. In addition, upon consummation of the Business Combination, we received an investment of 40 million from RTW in exchange for future royalty payments pursuant to the Revenue Interest Financing; we are also required to make royalty payments on an additional 7.5 million under the New RIFA. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. 
 Our ability to make scheduled payments of debt principal and interest on our existing or future indebtedness, or to refinance our indebtedness, and to pay our royalty obligations, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our debt, including the Amended Note Purchase Agreement, contains certain financial covenants relating to minimum liquidity and minimum revenue requirements. We have received waivers of minimum liquidity and minimum revenue requirements under debt arrangements in the past, but there is no guarantee that we will not need to obtain waivers of financial covenants in the future or that, should we require them, that we would obtain such waiver on terms favorable to the Company, or at all. To the extent that we are unable to continue to comply with such ongoing minimum liquidity and revenue requirements, including as a result of any weakness in our business or macroeconomic trends, and are unable to procure 
 60 

additional waivers from RTW or other lenders in the future, such lenders may pursue a number of actions, including declaring us in breach of our covenants, requiring conditions to cure such breaches and/or exercising foreclosure remedies. Any or all of these actions may materially impact our working capital, and our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund operations, service our debt, and satisfy our royalty payment obligations. If we are unable to generate such cash flows, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as raising additional capital on terms that may be unfavorable, selling assets or portions of our business, or ceasing operations. Our ability to refinance our existing or any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. 
 In addition, our indebtedness owed to RTW is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and subject to customary financial and operating covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, change our material line of business, modify our organizational documents, create liens, sell assets, or prepay other indebtedness. These covenants may make it difficult to operate our business. We are also subject to standard event of default provisions under the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement, New RIFA and the Amended Note Purchase Agreement, that, if triggered, would allow the debt to be accelerated, which could significantly deplete our cash resources, cause us to raise additional capital at unfavorable terms, require us to sell portions of our business or result in us becoming insolvent. The existing collateral pledged to RTW, and the covenants to which we are bound, may (i) prevent us from being able to secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all, or to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions, (ii) heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, industry or the economy in general, (iii) limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions, and (iv) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have greater capital resources.

 Restructuring Plan 
 On November 6, 2024, the Company s board of directors approved a restructuring plan to reduce operating costs and better align its workforce with the needs of its business. The majority of the restructuring is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Under the restructuring plan, the Company is reducing its workforce by approximately 113 roles (approximately 50 ). In connection with the restructuring, the Company estimates that it will incur one-time aggregate restructuring charges of approximately 3.5 million, which will be recorded primarily in the fourth quarter of 2024, related to severance payments and other employee-related costs. The cash payments related to the personnel-related restructuring will be paid primarily during the first quarter of 2025. The charges that the Company expects to incur in connection with the workforce reduction are subject to a number of assumptions, and actual results may differ materially. The Company may also incur additional costs not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or that are associated with, the workforce reduction.

 CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO 
 RULES 13a-14(a) AND 15d-14(a) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, 
 AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
 I, Shantanu Gaur, certify that: 
 1. I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Allurion Technologies, Inc.; 

2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 

3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 

4. The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 

(a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 

(b) Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
