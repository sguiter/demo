Our operating company, previously known as Lulu s Fashion Lounge, Inc., was converted from a California corporation to a Delaware limited liability company, Lulu s Fashion Lounge, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Lulu s Fashion Lounge Holdings, Inc. In connection with our initial public offering, the LP was liquidated. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the terms Lulus, we, us, our, or the Company refer to Lulu s Fashion Lounge Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 29, October 1, 2024 2023 Loss before benefit (provision) for income taxes ) ) Benefit (provision) for income taxes ) Effective tax rate ) The Company s provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods has historically been calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to ordinary income or loss (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period. The Company s pre-tax loss for the period ended September 29, 2024 relative to the Company s projected pre-tax income for fiscal 2024 yielded an annual effective tax rate, which was deemed to be appropriate or meaningful. Based on this fact, the Company determined that the historical estimated annual effective tax rate method would provide a reliable estimate and was used for calculating the interim provision for the period ended September 29, 2024. For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, the Company's effective tax rate differs from the federal income tax rate of primarily due to the Company s valuation allowance resulting from the lack of sufficient positive evidence that the deferred taxes will be more-likely-than-not realized in the future. For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023, the Company's effective tax rate differs from the federal income tax rate of primarily due to non-deductible executive compensation and non-deductible equity-based compensation expense. The Company regularly assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we weigh all available positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, historical earnings, scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income. Due to the weight of objectively verifiable negative evidence, the Company established a valuation allowance of million during the thirteen weeks ended June 30, 2024 and maintained such valuation allowance for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. This was comprised of a valuation allowance of million for the net deferred taxes as of December 31, 2023 and an adjustment of million for the thirty-nine week period through September 29, 2024. The significant piece of objectively verifiable negative evidence evaluated was the recent cumulative losses. The Company s ability to use its deferred tax assets depends on the amount of taxable income in future periods.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Item I, Part 1A, Risk Factors in the 2023 10-K, Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 29, 2024.

Impact of Macroeconomic Trends on Business Changing macroeconomic factors, including inflation, interest rates, student loan repayment resumption, world events, wars and domestic and international conflicts and overall consumer confidence with respect to current and future economic conditions, have directly impacted our sales through the first nine months of 2024 as discretionary consumer spending levels and shopping behavior fluctuate with these factors. We have responded to these factors by taking appropriate pricing, promotional and other actions to stimulate customer demand. These factors are expected to continue to have an impact on our business, results of operations, our growth and financial condition. Liquidity The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, we incurred net losses of 6.9 million and 23.4 million, respectively. In November 2021, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the 2021 Credit Agreement with Bank of America (the lender to provide a Revolving Facility (the 2021 Revolving Facility that provided for borrowings up to 50.0 million. On July 22, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the 2024 Amended Credit Agreement which reduced the Revolving Commitment (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement) to 15.0 million, and further reduces the 2021 Revolving Facility to 10.0 million on March 31, 2025 and extended the maturity date to August 15, 2025, as further described in Note 5, Debt. As of September 29, 2024, we had total cash and cash equivalents of 6.3 million and 11.5 million due under the 2024 Amended Credit Agreement classified within total current liabilities. We borrowed an additional 1.6 million under the terms of the 2024 Amended Credit Agreement subsequent to September 29, 2024. As of September 29, 2024, we were not in compliance with our preliminary financial covenants for the third quarter 2024 as required by our 2024 Amended Credit Agreement. On November 12, 2024, we entered into a second amendment

Table of Contents 
 to the 2021 Credit Agreement (the November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement as described in Note 5, Debt and Note 13, Subsequent Events . The November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement extended our reporting deadline for our financial statements and covenant compliance certificate for the third quarter 2024 to December 16, 2024, and required that the financial covenants be tested on the earlier of the date the financial statements and compliance certificate for the third quarter 2024 are delivered or December 16, 2024. The November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement also provided that the failure to deliver the financial statements and covenant compliance certificate within the original time period required by the 2024 Amended Credit Agreement will not constitute an event of default. Further, the filing of this Form 10-Q with the SEC shall not be deemed to constitute delivery of the financial statements and compliance certificate for the third quarter 2024. The November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement also revised the applicable interest rates for borrowings for the period commencing on November 12, 2024, as described in Note 13, Subsequent Events . We have no further access to funds in accordance with the terms of the November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement. If we have not refinanced the revolving credit facility or obtained a further waiver or amendment prior to December 16, 2024, we expect to be in default of our 2024 Amended Credit Agreement, and as a result, our lenders would have the right in such circumstances to terminate any commitments to provide further borrowings and to elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. We are actively seeking alternative debt financing and continue to take certain cash conservation measures, including adjustments to marketing and other fixed and variable costs and capital spend to meet our obligations as needed. As the ability to raise additional debt financing is outside of management s control, we cannot conclude that management s plans will be effectively implemented within twelve months from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Accordingly, we have concluded that these plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments relating to the outcome of this uncertainty . Key Operating and Financial Metrics We collect and analyze operating and financial data to assess the performance of our business and optimize resource allocation. The following table sets forth our key performance indicators for the periods presented. 

Thirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 29, October 1, September 29, October 1, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands, except percentages and Average Order Value) Gross Margin 38.1 40.3 42.1 42.4 Net loss (6,879) (3,889) (23,411) (12,104) Adjusted EBITDA (1) (3,572) 972 (6,438) 5,207 Adjusted EBITDA margin (1) (4.4) 1.2 (2.6) 1.9 Active Customers 2,670 2,960 2,670 2,960 Average Order Value 131 133 139 133 (1) For a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and why we consider them useful, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Active Customers We define Active Customers as the number of customers who have made at least one purchase across our platform in the prior 12-month period. Active Customer count is as of the last day of the relevant period. We consider the number of Active Customers to be a key performance metric on the basis that it is directly related to consumer awareness of our brand, our ability to attract visitors to our primarily digital platform, and our ability to convert visitors to paying customers. Active Customers counts are based on de-duplication logic using customer account and guest checkout name, address, and email information .

Table of Contents 
 Average Order Value We define Average Order Value AOV as the sum of the total gross sales before returns across our platform in a given period, plus shipping revenue, less discounts and markdowns, divided by the Total Orders Placed (as defined below) in that period. AOV reflects average basket size of our customers. AOV may fluctuate as we continue investing in the development and introduction of new Lulus merchandise and as a result of our promotional discount activity . Total Orders Placed We define Total Orders Placed as the number of customer orders placed across our platform during a particular period. An order is counted on the day the customer places the order. We do not adjust the number of Total Orders Placed for any cancellation or return that may have occurred subsequent to a customer placing an order. We consider Total Orders Placed as a key performance metric on the basis that it is directly related to our ability to attract and retain customers as well as drive purchase frequency. Total Orders Placed, together with AOV, is an indicator of the net revenue we expect to generate in a particular period . Gross Margin We define Gross Margin as gross profit as a percentage of our net revenue. Gross profit is equal to our net revenue less cost of revenue. Certain of our competitors and other retailers may report cost of revenue differently than we do. As a result, the reporting of our gross profit and Gross Margin may not be comparable to other companies . Non-GAAP Financial Measures We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. GAAP ). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional useful information in evaluating our performance and that excluding certain items that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude period-to-period from net loss provides useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating our ability to generate earnings and to more readily compare these metrics between past and future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies . Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Free Cash Flow Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net loss before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude the effects of equity-based compensation expense and other non-routine expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA , Adjusted EBITDA Margin (collectively referred to as Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow which are non-GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are several limitations related to the use of our non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the closest comparable GAAP measures. Some of these limitations include: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;

Table of Contents 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain non-routine expenses that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; Free Cash Flow does not represent the total residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes; and other companies in our industry may calculate such measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 Due to these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using these non-GAAP measures only supplementally. As noted in the table below, Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments to exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income taxes, equity-based compensation expense and other non-routine expenses. It is reasonable to expect that some of these items will occur in future periods. However, we believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our business and may complicate comparisons of our internal results of operations and results of operations of other companies over time. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for other items that we do not expect to regularly record. Each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described in this paragraph and in the following reconciliation table help management with a measure of our core operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) as a percentage of our net revenue. The following table provides a reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin:

The thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 include equity-based compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs granted during the period and prior periods, equity-based awards granted in prior periods, as well as forfeitures partially offset by accelerated vesting expense associated with the resignation of directors during the period. The thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023 include equity-based compensation expense for RSUs granted during the period, as well as equity-based awards granted in prior periods. The thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 include equity-based compensation expense for PSUs and

 RSUs granted during the period, accelerated expense associated with the voluntary forfeiture of stock options, and equity-based awards granted in prior periods. (2) The thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 include adjustments to previously accrued non-routine expenses related to a legal accrual net of insurance. Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for capitalized software development costs and purchases of property and equipment. We view Free Cash Flow as an important indicator of our liquidity because it measures the amount of cash we generate. A reconciliation to non-GAAP Free Cash Flow from net cash provided by operating activities for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 is as follows: 

Thirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (5,504) 12,749 5,133 21,100 Capitalized software development costs (406) (524) (1,144) (1,550) Purchases of property and equipment (386) (667) (1,271) (1,393) Free Cash Flow (6,296) 11,558 2,718 18,157 Factors Affecting Our Performance Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including what is discussed below. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 29, 2024 . Customer Acquisition Our business performance depends in part on our continued ability to cost-effectively acquire new customers. We define customer acquisition cost CAC as our brand and performance marketing expenses attributable to acquiring new customers, including, but not limited to, agency costs and marketing team costs but excluding any applicable equity-based compensation, divided by the number of customers who placed their first order with us in a given period. As a primarily digital brand, our marketing strategy is primarily focused on brand awareness marketing and digital advertising in channels like search, social, and programmatic platforms that enable us to engage our customer where she spends her time, and in many cases also quickly track the success of our marketing, which allows us to adjust and optimize our marketing spend . Customer Retention Our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and drive repeat purchases from our existing customers. We monitor retention across our entire customer base. Our goal is to attract and convert visitors into Active Customers and foster relationships that drive repeat purchases . During the trailing 12 months ended September 29, 2024, we served 2.7 million Active Customers compared to 3.0 million for the trailing 12 months ended October 1, 2023. Inventory Management We utilize a data-driven strategy that leverages our proprietary reorder algorithm to manage inventory as efficiently as possible. Our test, learn, and reorder approach consists of limited inventory purchases followed by the analysis of proprietary data including real-time transaction data and customer feedback, which then informs our selection and customization of popular merchandise prior to reordering in larger quantities. While our initial orders are limited in size

 and financial risk and our supplier partners are highly responsive, we nonetheless purchase inventory in anticipation of future demand and therefore are exposed to potential shifts in customer preferences and price sensitivity over time. As we continue to grow, we will adjust our inventory purchases to align with the current needs of the business . Investment in Our Operations and Infrastructure We will continue to invest in our operations and infrastructure to facilitate further operational efficiencies and growth of our business, while managing expenses to align with our net revenue expectations and goals to return to profitability. We will continue to set a high bar for any new investments or capital spending initiatives as we believe that a disciplined approach to capital spending will enable us to generate positive returns on our investments over the long term . Components of Our Results of Operations Net Revenue Net revenue consists primarily of gross sales, net of merchandise returns, international duties and taxes and promotional discounts and markdowns, generated from the sale of apparel, footwear, and accessories. Net revenue excludes sales taxes assessed by governmental authorities. We recognize net revenue at the point in time when control of the ordered product is transferred to the customer, which we determine to have occurred upon shipment . Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of revenue consists of the product costs of merchandise sold to customers; shipping and handling costs, including all inbound, outbound, and return shipping expenses; rent, insurance, business property tax, utilities, depreciation and amortization, and repairs and maintenance related to our distribution facilities; and charges related to inventory shrinkage, damages, and our allowance for excess or obsolete inventory. Cost of revenue is primarily driven by growth in orders placed by customers, the mix of the product available for sale on our site, and transportation costs related to inventory receipts from our suppliers. We expect our cost of revenue to fluctuate as a percentage of net revenue primarily due to how we manage our inventory and merchandise mix. Gross profit is equal to our net revenue less cost of revenue. We calculate Gross Margin as gross profit as a percentage of our net revenue. Our Gross Margin varies across Lulus, exclusive to Lulus, and third-party branded products. Exclusive to Lulus consists of products that we develop with design partners and have exclusive rights to sell across our platform, but that do not bear the Lulus brand. Gross Margin on sales of Lulus and exclusive to Lulus merchandise is generally higher than Gross Margin on sales of third-party branded products, which we offer for customers to round out the shopping basket. As we continue to optimize our distribution capabilities and gain more negotiation leverage with suppliers as we scale, our Gross Margin may fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these factors. Selling and Marketing Expenses Our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of payment processing fees, advertising, targeted online performance marketing and customer order courtesy adjustments. Selling and marketing expenses also include our spend on brand marketing channels, including compensation and free products to social media influencers, events, and other forms of online and offline marketing related to growing and retaining the customer base. As discussed in Net Revenue above, in any given period, the amount of our selling and marketing expense can be affected by the use of promotional discounts in such period . General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefits costs, including equity-based compensation for our employees involved in general corporate functions including finance, merchandising, marketing, and technology, as well as costs associated with the use by these functions of facilities and equipment, including depreciation, rent, and other occupancy expenses. General and administrative expenses are primarily driven by increases in headcount required to support business growth and meet our obligations as a public company.

 Since our IPO, we have incurred significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We expect that compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. Interest Expense Interest expense consists of interest expense related to the 2021 Revolving Facility . Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes represents federal, state, and local income taxes. The effective rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the establishment of valuation allowance as the Company could not provide sufficient positive evidence that the deferred taxes will be more-likely-than-not realized in the future. Our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, the impact of permanent tax adjustments, tax audit settlements, and the interaction of various tax strategies. We regularly assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we weigh all available positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, historical earnings, scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income. Due to the weight of objectively verifiable negative evidence, we established a valuation allowance of 5.4million during the thirteen weeks ended June 30, 2024 and maintained such valuation allowance for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. This was comprised of a valuation allowance of 5.7 million for the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 and an adjustment of 0.3 million for the thirty-nine week period through September 29, 2024. The significant piece of objectively verifiable negative evidence evaluated was the recent cumulative losses. Our ability to use our deferred tax assets depends on the amount of taxable income in future periods. Our Results of Operations The following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of net revenue and net loss :

Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue increased in the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 by 0.3 million, or 1 compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to a higher mix of markdown sales compared to the same period of the prior year. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased in the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 by 2.9 million, or 9 compared to the same period of the prior year which was primarily driven by higher markdowns and discounts. Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling and marketing expenses increased in the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 by 0.8 million, or 5 , compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023, primarily due to higher online marketing costs. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased by 1.7 million in the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, or 8 , compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 2.2 million decrease in stock based compensation expense, a 0.4 million decrease in non-routine items accruals, a 0.3 million decrease in D O liability insurance and legal and professional fees, a 0.2 million decrease in variable labor and benefits associated with lower sales volume and operational efficiencies, and a 0.1 million decrease in board-related fees due to the reduction of our board size and temporary suspension of director cash compensation. This was partially offset by a 1.5 million increase in software, fixed labor, and depreciation and amortization. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased in the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 by 0.1 million, or 31 , compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023. The decrease is attributable to lower average borrowings and lower unused

 revolving facility fees related to the reduction in the size of our 2021 Revolving Facility under the 2024 Amended Credit Agreement. Income Tax Benefit (Provision) Our income tax provision in the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 was immaterial, which was an increase of 1.2 million compared to a benefit of 1.2 million in the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the valuation allowance tax expense that was recorded against federal and state deferred tax assets. Comparisons for the Thirty-nine Weeks Ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 Net Revenue Net revenue decreased in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 by 30.5 million, or 11 , compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. The decrease is primarily the result of a 12 decrease in Total Orders Placed, with the impact of higher AOV partially offset by higher return rates compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue decreased in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 by 16.8 million, or 10 , compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023, which was primarily driven by the impact of lower net revenue. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 by 13.7 million, or 12 compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023, which was primarily driven by the impact of the lower volume of sales along with higher markdowns and discounts. Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling and marketing expenses decreased in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 by 0.8 million, or 1 , compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 due to lower performance marketing spend and lower merchant fees due to lower sales volume, partially offset by higher brand marketing spend. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased by 7.9 million in the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, or 11 , compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 7.3 million decrease related to equity-based awards, a 2.3 million decrease in variable labor and benefits associated with lower sales volume and operational efficiencies, and a 1.1 million decrease in D O liability insurance and legal and professional fees. This was partially offset by a 1.6 million increase in fixed labor and 1.3 million in software, occupancy, depreciation and amortization. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 by 0.4 million, or 31 , compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. The decrease is attributable to lower average borrowings and lower unused revolving facility fees, partially offset by higher interest rates.

 Income Tax Benefit (Provision) Our income tax provision in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 increased by 6.8 million to 5.8 million, compared to a benefit of 1.0 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the valuation allowance tax expense that was recorded against federal and state deferred tax assets. Quarterly Trends and Seasonality We experience moderate seasonal fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Seasonality in our business does not follow that of traditional retailers, such as a typical concentration of revenue in the holiday quarter. Our net revenue is typically highest in the second and third quarters due to the highest demand for event dresses in the spring and summer. Net revenue is typically the lowest in the first and fourth quarters when event dresses are less in demand. The seasonality of our business has resulted in variability in our total net revenue quarter-to-quarter. We believe that this seasonality has affected and will continue to affect our results of operations. Our quarterly gross profit fluctuates primarily based on how we manage our inventory and merchandise mix and has typically been in line with fluctuations in net revenue. When quarterly gross profit fluctuations have deviated relative to the fluctuations in sales, these situations have been driven by non-recurring, external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Selling and marketing expenses generally fluctuate with net revenue. Further, in any given period, the amount of our selling and marketing expense can be affected by the use of promotional discounts in such period. In addition, we may increase or decrease marketing spend to assist with optimizing inventory mix and quantities. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefit costs and vary quarter to quarter due to changes in the number of seasonal workers to meet demand based on our seasonality. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash generated from operating activities as we have no further access to borrowings under our 2021 Revolving Facility, as amended by the 2024 Amended Credit Agreement. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are inventory purchases, payroll and general operating expenses, capital expenditures associated with our distribution facilities, capitalized software and debt service requirements . Credit Facilities On November 15, 2021, we entered into the 2021 Credit Agreement with the lender to provide the 2021 Revolving Facility that provided for borrowings up to 50.0 million with a maturity date of November 15, 2024. All borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement accrued interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (x) the term daily SOFR plus the applicable SOFR adjustment plus a margin of 1.75 per annum or (y) the base rate plus a margin of 0.75 (with the base rate being the highest of the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , the prime rate and term SOFR for a period of one month plus 1.00 ). On July 22, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Amended Credit Agreement which extended the maturity date from November 15, 2024 to August 15, 2025 and r educed the 2021 Revolving Facility from 50.0 million to 15.0 million, with a further reduction to 10.0 million on March 31, 2025 . Under the 2024 Amended Credit Agreement, we can increase the aggregate amount of the facility by 10.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including an asset coverage ratio of at least 1.50:1.00, recalculated as of the last day of the most recently ended month for which financial statements are internally available. The 2024 Amended Credit Agreement also reduced the previous letters of credit sublimit from 7.5 million to 5.0 million. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, the Company borrowed 31.5 million under the 2021 Credit Agreement and the 2024 Amended Credit Agreement and repaid 28.0 million of the outstanding balance. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had 0.5 million letters of credit outstanding. We borrowed an additional 1.6 million

 under the terms of the 2024 Amended Credit Agreement subsequent to September 29, 2024. For further information on the 2021 Credit Agreement and and the 2024 Amended Credit Agreement, see Note 5, Debt. The 2024 Amended Credit Agreement retained the previous maximum total leverage ratio covenant of 2.00:1.00 and added a financial covenant that requires a fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of any period of four consecutive quarters, commencing June 30, 2024, to be less than 1.15:1.00. As of September 29, 2024, we were not in compliance with our preliminary financial covenants for the third quarter 2024 as required by our 2024 Amended Credit Agreement. On November 12, 2024, we entered into the November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement as described in Note 5, Debt and Note 13, Subsequent Events . The November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement extended our reporting deadline for our financial statements and covenant compliance certificate for the third quarter 2024 to December 16, 2024, and required that the financial covenants be tested on the earlier of the date the financial statements and compliance certificate are delivered or December 16, 2024. The November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement also provided that the failure to deliver the financial statements and covenant compliance certificate within the original time period required by the 2024 Amended Credit Agreement will not constitute an event of default. Further, the filing of this Form 10-Q with the SEC shall not be deemed to constitute delivery of the financial statements and compliance certificate for the third quarter 2024. The November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement also revised the applicable interest rates for borrowings for the period commencing on November 12, 2024, as described in Note 13, Subsequent Events . Until the earlier of the date the financial statements and compliance certificate are delivered or December 16, 2024, we have no further access to the revolving commitments under the November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement. If we have not refinanced the revolving credit facility or obtained a further waiver or amendment prior to December 16, 2024, we expect to be in default of our 2024 Amended Credit Agreement, and as a result, our lenders would have the right in such circumstances to terminate any commitments to provide further borrowings and to elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. We are actively seeking alternative debt financing and continuing to take certain cash conservation measures, including adjustments to marketing and other fixed and variable costs and capital spend to meet our obligations as needed. Availability and Use of Cash As of September 29, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 6.3 million. During the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, we took certain cost reduction and cash conservation measures, including adjustments to marketing spend, and other fixed, variable, and capital spend. We will continue to take certain cost reduction and cash conservation measures to meet our obligations as needed. As the ability to raise additional debt financing is outside of our control, we cannot conclude that our plans will be effectively implemented within twelve months from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Accordingly, we have concluded that these plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments relating to the outcome of this uncertainty. Actual results of operations will depend on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, as further discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors included in our 2023 10-K and risk factors set forth in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 29, 2024. Repurchases Pursuant to the 2024 Repurchase Program On May 3, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 2.5 million of our common stock (the 2024 Repurchase Program ). The actual timing, number, and value of shares repurchased in the future will be determined at our discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, applicable legal requirements, our capital needs, and whether there is a better alternative use of capital. Repurchases will be funded from our existing cash and cash equivalents, or future cash flow. The 2024 Repurchase Program may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time. During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, we repurchased 130,293 shares and 178,143 shares of common stock, respectively, in open market transactions pursuant to a 10b5-1 purchase plan. As of September 29, 2024, there was 2.2 million available under the 2024 Repurchase Program authorization. For further information on the 2024 Repurchase Program, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies .

 Cash Flow Analysis The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 29, October 1, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 5,133 21,100 Investing activities (2,415) (3,009) Financing activities 1,084 (15,444) Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 3,802 2,647 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, equity-based compensation, the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 16.0 million, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was largely due to an increase of 11.5 million in our net loss after adjusting for non-cash items, a 4.7 million increase in inventory purchases, a 3.8 million increase in prepaids and other current assets mainly due to an insurance receivable of 4.7 million partially offset by the write-off of our debt issuance costs pertaining to the 2021 Revolving Facility, prepaid marketing and prepaid software subscriptions, an increase of 2.3 million in income tax refund receivable, an increase of 1.4 million in accounts receivable pertaining to credit card and wholesale receivables, a decrease of 1.2 million in accounts payable primarily related to the timing of payments related to our credit card payables and a 0.4 million decrease related to operating lease liabilities. This was partially offset by a 7.5 million increase related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities mainly due to an increase in our non-routine legal reserve accrual of 4.6 million, an increase in stored value liabilities of 3.3 million due to lower redemption rates, a timing related increase in accrued inventory of 1.3 million, and an increase in miscellaneous accruals of 0.3 million offset by a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits of 0.7 million, a decrease in accrued freight of 0.4 million, a decrease in the return reserve of 0.4 million as a result of lower sales and a slight decrease in return rates, as well as a decrease in accrued marketing of 0.2 million. In addition, there was a 1.6 million increase related to other noncurrent liabilities and a 0.2 million increase related to assets for recovery. Investing Activities Our primary investing activities have consisted of purchases of equipment to support our overall business growth and internally developed software for the continued development of our proprietary technology infrastructure. Purchases of property and equipment may vary from period-to-period due to timing of the expansion of our operations. We have no material commitments for capital expenditures . During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, net cash used in investing activities decreased by 0.6 million. This was attributable to 0.5 million less invested in capitalized software development costs and 0.1 million lower capital expenditures for furniture, leasehold improvements, equipment, and construction in progress for our general operations . Financing Activities Financing activities consist primarily of borrowings and repayments related to our revolving line of credit. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities increased by 16.5 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher net borrowings of 21.5 million

 on our revolving line of credit and a 0.2 million decrease in withheld tax payments related to vesting of RSUs, partially offset by 4.0 million of higher repayments on our revolving line of credit, 0.7 million increase in finance lease payments, 0.3 million decrease in proceeds received from issuance of common stock under our ESPP and 0.2 million increase related to the 2024 Repurchase Program . Contractual Obligations and Commitments Other than the November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement discussed in Note 5, Debt and Note 13, Subsequent Events , there have been no other material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments as disclosed in our 2023 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. Our critical accounting policies are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our 2023 10-K and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in our 2023 10-K. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our 2023 10-K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption, and our assessment, to the extent we have made one, of their potential impact on our financial position and our results of operations. JOBS Act Accounting Election We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements and our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There has been no material change in our exposure to market risk from that discussed in our 2023 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource 

 40 

Table of Contents 
 constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 29, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 29, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we may be a party to litigation and subject to claims, including employment claims, wage and hour claims, intellectual property claims, privacy claims, contractual and commercial disputes and other matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business . We accrue a liability when management believes information available prior to the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements indicates it is probable a loss has been incurred as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We adjust our accruals to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Legal costs are expensed as incurred. As disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024, we received a cease and desist letter alleging intellectual property infringement. This matter was resolved by the parties at a confidential mediation subsequent to the quarter ended September 29, 2024. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had accrued a liability net of anticipated insurance receivable related to resolution of this matter in an amount that was not material to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. Other than as discussed above, we are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that we believe would, if determined adversely to us, materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations . Item 1A. Risk Factors. For detailed information about certain risk factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 . Set forth below are material changes to an existing risk factor previously disclosed in the 2023 10-K. Other than the risk factor set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2023 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. We may require additional capital to support business growth and this capital might not be available or may be available only by diluting existing stockholders or by raising additional debt financing at restrictive terms. We may need to raise additional funds, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all. If we raise additional equity financing, stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests. If we raise additional debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to 

 41 

Table of Contents 
 incur additional indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. As of November 12, 2024, we have no further access to funds under our 2021 Revolving Facility in accordance with the terms of the November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement, which, among other things, extends our reporting deadline for our financial statements and covenant compliance certificate for the third quarter 2024 to December 16, 2024. If we have not refinanced the 2021 Revolving Facility or obtained a further waiver or amendment of the November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement prior to December 16, 2024, we expect to be in default of our 2024 Amended Credit Agreement and as a result our lenders would have the right in such circumstances to terminate any commitments to provide further borrowings and to elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. For further information on the 2021 Revolving Facility, the 2024 Amended Credit Agreement, and the November 2024 Amended Credit Agreement, see Note 5, Debt and Note 13, Subsequent Events . If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, or at all, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited and our business and prospects could fail or be adversely affected.
