 Orion Group Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and per Share Amounts) (Unaudited) reportable segments pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting . The tools used by the chief operating decision maker CODM to allocate resources and assess performance are based on reportable and operating segments: marine and concrete, which operate under the Orion brand and logo. In making this determination, the Company considered the similar economic characteristics of its operations that comprise its marine segment. For the marine segment, the methods used, and the internal processes employed, to deliver marine construction services are similar throughout the segment, including standardized estimating, project controls and project management. This segment has the same customers with similar funding drivers and are subject to similar regulatory regimes driven through Federal agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA ), among others. Additionally, the segment is driven by macro-economic considerations including the level of import/export seaborne transportation, development of energy-related infrastructure, cruise line expansion and operations, marine bridge infrastructure development, waterway pipeline crossings and the maintenance of waterways. These considerations, and others, are key catalysts for future prospects and are similar across the segment. For the concrete segment, the Company also considered the similar economic characteristics of these operations. The methods used, and the internal processes employed, to deliver concrete construction services are similar throughout the segment, including standardized estimating, project controls and project management. The projects of this segment are subject to similar regulatory regimes such as OSHA. Additionally, this segment is driven by macro-economic considerations, including movements in population, commercial real estate development, institutional funding and expansion, and recreational development,

 million and million, respectively. Balances billed to customers but not paid pursuant to retainage provisions in construction contracts generally become payable upon contract completion and acceptance by the owner. Retainage at September 30, 2024 totaled million, of which million is expected to be collected beyond September 30, 2025. Retainage at December 31, 2023 totaled million. From time to time, the Company negotiates change orders and claims with its customers. Unsuccessful negotiations of claims could result in a change to contract revenue that is less than amounts previously recorded, which could result in the recording of a loss in the amount of the shortfall. Successful claims negotiations could result in the recovery of previously recorded losses. Significant losses on receivables could adversely affect the Company s financial position, results of operations and overall liquidity.

 until the next scheduled maintenance. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations for the respective period. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets for financial statement purposes, as follows: to Buildings and improvements to Construction equipment to Vessels and other equipment to Office equipment to The Company generally uses accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where beneficial. Dry-docking costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over a period ranging from three to . Dry-docking costs include, but are not limited to, the inspection, refurbishment and replacement of steel, engine components, tailshafts, mooring equipment and other parts of the vessel. Amortization related to dry-docking activities is included as a component of depreciation. These costs and the related amortization periods are periodically reviewed to determine if the estimates are accurate. If warranted, a significant upgrade of equipment may result in a revision to the useful life of the asset, in which case the change is accounted for prospectively. Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.

The marine segment s excess loss coverage responds to most of its policies when a primary limit of million has been exhausted; provided that the primary limit for Contingent Maritime Employer s Liability is million and the Watercraft Pollution Policy primary limit is million. The concrete segment maintains levels of excess loss insurance coverage, totaling million in excess of primary coverage. The concrete segment s excess loss coverage responds to most of its policies when a primary limit of million has been exhausted. If a claim arises and a potential insurance recovery is probable, the impending gain is recognized separately from the related loss. The recovery will only be recognized up to the amount of the loss once the recovery of the claim is deemed probable and any excess gain will fall under contingency accounting and will only be recognized once it is realized. The Company does not net insurance recoveries against the related claim liability

A fully funded policy is offered primarily to salaried employees and their dependents while a partially self-funded plan with an appropriate stop-loss is offered primarily to hourly employees and their dependents.

 Dredging Specialty Services Marine segment contract revenues Concrete Segment Structural Light Commercial Concrete segment contract revenues Total contract revenues The Company has determined that it has reportable segments pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting , but has disaggregated its contract revenues in the above chart in terms of services provided within such segments. In making this determination, the Company considered the similar characteristics of its operations as discussed in Note 1 . Additionally, as discussed, both the marine and concrete segments have limited contracts with multiple performance obligations. The Company s contracts are often estimated and bid as one project and evaluated as to performance as one project, not by individual services performed by each. Both the marine and concrete segments have a single individual responsible for managing the entire segment, not by service lines of the segments. Resources are allocated by segment and financial and budgetary information is compiled and reviewed by segment, not service line. Marine Segment Construction services include construction, restoration, maintenance, dredging and repair of marine transportation facilities, marine pipelines, bridges and causeways and marine environmental structures. Dredging services generally enhance or preserve the navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil, sand or rock. Specialty services include design, salvage, demolition, surveying, towing, diving and underwater inspection, excavation and repair. Concrete Segment Structural services include elevated concrete pouring for products such as columns, elevated beams and structural walls. Light commercial services include horizontally poured concrete for products such as slabs, sidewalks, ramps and tilt walls. Other services comprise labor related to concrete pouring such as rebar installation and pumping services and typically support the Company s structural and light commercial services.

At December 31, 2023, a customer in the Private Companies category accounted for of total current receivables. Additionally, the table below represents concentrations of contract revenue by type of customer for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively: State Governments Local Government Private Companies Total contract revenues For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the United States Navy, which is included in the Federal Government category, accounted for of total contract revenues and a customer in the Private Companies category accounted for of total contract revenues.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, no single customer accounted for more than 10.0 of total contract revenues. With the exception of the Unites States Navy, the Company does not believe that the loss of any one of its customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates since no single specific customer besides the United States Navy sustains such a large portion of receivables or contract revenue over time.

Certain information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including but not limited to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A ), may constitute forward-looking statements as such term is defined within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical facts, including those that express a belief, expectation, or intention are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future production, our pipeline of opportunities, conversion of backlog, revenues, income and capital spending.

We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, including unforeseen productivity delays and other difficulties encountered in project execution, challenges incurred by virtue of our position as a substantial subcontractor that reports to a significantly larger project contractor, levels of government funding or other governmental budgetary constraints, contract modifications and changes, including change orders and contract cancellation at the discretion of the customer . These and other important factors, including those described under Risk Factors in Part 1, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 may cause our actual results, performance- or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.

 Overview Orion Group Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (hereafter collectively referred to as the Company ), is a leading specialty construction company serving the infrastructure, industrial, and building sectors, providing services both on and off the water in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Canada and the Caribbean Basin through our marine segment and our concrete segment. Our marine segment provides construction and dredging services including marine transportation facility construction, marine pipeline construction, marine environmental structures construction, dredging of waterways, channels and ports, environmental dredging, design, and specialty services related to marine construction, fabrication, and dredging. Our concrete segment provides turnkey concrete construction services including concrete surface place and finish, site preparation, layout, forming, and rebar placement for large commercial, structural and other associated business areas. We are headquartered in Houston, Texas with regional offices throughout our operating areas. Our contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to requests for proposals by federal, state and local agencies and through negotiation and competitive bidding with private parties and general contractors. Our bidding activity and strategies are affected by factors such as our backlog, current utilization of equipment and other resources, job location, our ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations. The timing and location of awarded contracts may result in unpredictable fluctuations in the results of our operations. Most of our revenue is derived from fixed-price contracts. We record revenue on construction contracts over time, measured by the percentage of actual contract costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract. There are a number of factors that can create variability in contract performance and therefore impact the results of our operations. The most significant of these include the following: completeness and accuracy of the original bid; increases in commodity prices such as concrete, steel and fuel; customer delays, work stoppages, and other costs due to weather and environmental restrictions; subcontractor performance; unforeseen site conditions; availability and skill level of workers; and a change in availability and proximity of equipment and materials. 
 All of these factors can have a negative impact on our contract performance, which can adversely affect the timing of revenue recognition and ultimate contract profitability. We plan our operations and bidding activity with these factors in mind and they generally have not had a material adverse impact on the results of our operations in the past. Consolidated Results of Operations Backlog Information Our contract backlog represents our estimate of the revenues we expect to realize under the portion of contracts remaining to be performed. Given the typical duration of our contracts, which is generally less than a year, our backlog at any point in time usually represents only a portion of the revenue that we expect to realize during a

 twelve-month period. We have not been adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications in the past, however we may be in the future, especially in periods of economic uncertainty. Backlog as of the periods ended below are as follows (in millions):

These estimates are subject to fluctuations based upon the scope of services to be provided, as well as factors affecting the time required to complete the project. Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future results. In addition to our backlog under contract, we also have a substantial number of projects in negotiation or pending award at any given time. Delays in decisions on pending awards also have a negative impact on the timing and amount by which we are able to increase backlog.

We recorded tax expense of 0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to tax benefit of 0.1 million in the prior year period. We expect near break-even operations for the full year ended December 31, 2024, such that a small change in the year-to-date operations could result in a large change to the estimated annual effective tax rate. Therefore, our effective tax rate for the period ending September 30, 2024, is based off actual year-to-date operations.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Changes in working capital are normal within our business given the varying mix in size, scope, seasonality and timing of delivery of our projects. At September 30, 2024, our working capital was 72.2 million, as compared to 55.9 million at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash on hand of 28.3 million. Our borrowing availability under our revolving portion of our Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024 was approximately 46.1 million. Our primary liquidity needs are to finance our working capital and fund capital expenditures. Historically, our source of liquidity has been cash provided by our operating activities, sale of underutilized assets, and borrowings under our credit facilities. The assessment of our liquidity requires us to make estimates of future activity and judgments about whether we are compliant with financial covenant calculations under our debt and other agreements and have adequate liquidity to operate. Significant assumptions used in our forecasted model of liquidity include forecasted sales, costs, and capital expenditures, as well as expected timing and proceeds of planned real estate transactions. Recent Developments On September 12, 2024, we completed the sale of 5,589,000 shares of common stock, including 729,000 shares of common stock pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters, in an underwritten public offering. We received net proceeds of approximately 26.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and other estimated offering expenses payable by us. The net proceeds were used for working capital and for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

 Cash Flow The following table provides information regarding our cash flows and our capital expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss) 4,262 (660) (8,398) (13,510) Adjustments to remove non-cash and non-operating items 8,362 8,214 27,874 16,393 Cash flow from net income after adjusting for non-cash and non-operating items 12,624 7,554 19,476 2,883 Change in operating assets and liabilities (working capital) 22,532 (24,079) (20,163) (31,384) Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities 35,156 (16,525) (687) (28,501) Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities (2,589) (1,650) (8,722) 5,391 Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities (9,150) 13,990 6,725 23,207 Capital expenditures (included in investing activities above) (4,157) (2,387) (10,644) (6,678) Operating Activities. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated approximately 35.2 million in cash from our operating activities. The net cash inflow was comprised of 22.5 million of inflows related to changes in net working capital and 12.6 million of cash inflows from net income, after adjusting for non-cash items. The changes in net working capital, which are reflected as changes in operating assets and liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were primarily driven by a 11.5 million cash inflow related to an increase in our net position of accounts receivable and accounts payable plus accrued liabilities during the period, 9.4 million of cash inflows pursuant to the relative timing and significance of project progression and billings during the period, and a 4.2 million inflow related to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other, partially offset by a 2.1 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and 0.5 million of other outflows. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used approximately 0.7 million in cash in our operating activities. The net cash outflow was comprised of 20.2 million of outflows related to changes in net working capital, partially offset by 19.5 million of cash inflows from net income, after adjusting for non-cash items. The changes in net working capital, which are reflected as changes in operating assets and liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were primarily driven by a 21.1 million cash outflow related to a decrease in our net position of accounts receivable and accounts payable plus accrued liabilities during the period, a 6.6 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and 0.7 million of other outflows, partially offset by a 4.9 million inflow related to a decrease in prepaid expenses and 3.3 million of cash inflows pursuant to the relative timing and significance of project progression and billings during the period. Investing Activities. Capital asset additions and betterments to our fleet were 4.2 million and 2.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Proceeds from the sale of property and equipment were 1.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Capital asset additions and betterments to our fleet were 10.6 million and 6.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Proceeds from the sale of property and equipment were 1.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 12.1 million in the nine months ended

 September 30, 2023. Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 8.1 million of proceeds related to the sale-leaseback of the Port Lavaca South Yard property in Texas. Financing Activities. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had proceeds from an offering of common stock of 27.2 million, borrowings of 10.1 million and repayments of 32.8 million on the White Oak revolving credit line, repayments of 10.0 million on the White Oak term loan, payments on finance lease liabilities of 2.3 million, payments made on failed sale-leaseback arrangements of 0.9 million, 0.4 million of payments related to tax withholding for share-based compensation and repayments of 0.1 million on other debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had proceeds from an offering of common stock of 27.2 million, borrowings and repayments of 39.3 million on the White Oak revolving credit line, repayments of 10.0 million on the White Oak term loan, payments on finance lease liabilities of 6.5 million, payments made on failed sale-leaseback arrangements of 3.2 million, 0.4 million of payments related to tax withholding for share-based compensation, repayments of 0.4 million on other debt, loan costs of 0.4 million and a cash inflow of 0.4 million for proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Sources of Capital On May 15, 2023, we entered into a new three-year 103.0 million Credit Agreement with White Oak which includes a 65.0 million asset based revolving credit line and a 38.0 million fixed asset term loan. Please see Note 9 Debt in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the amended agreement as of September 30, 2024. Bonding Capacity We are often required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide additional security to our customers for our performance under certain government and private sector contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends on our capitalization, working capital, past performance and external factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. At September 30, 2024, the capacity under our current bonding arrangement was at least 950 million, with approximately 550 million of projects being bonded. While we believe that our current bonding capacity is sufficient to satisfy current demand for our services, any new major project opportunities may require us to seek additional bonding capacity in the future. We believe our balance sheet and working capital position will allow us to access additional bonding capacity as needed in the future. Effect of Inflation We are subject to the effects of inflation through increases in the cost of raw materials, and other items such as fuel, concrete and steel. Due to the relative short-term duration of our projects, we are generally able to include anticipated cost increases in the pricing of our bids. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our results of operations are subject to risks related to fluctuations in commodity prices and fluctuations in interest rates. Historically, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has not been material and has been limited to temporary field accounts located in foreign countries where we perform work. Foreign currency fluctuations were immaterial in this reporting period.

 Commodity price risk We are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices for concrete, steel products and fuel. Although we routinely attempt to secure firm quotes from our suppliers, we generally do not hedge against increases in prices for commodity products. Commodity price risks may have an impact on our results of operations due to the fixed-price nature of many of our contracts, although the short-term duration of our projects may allow us to include cost increases to the pricing of our bids. Interest rate risk At September 30, 2024, we had 28.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement, with a weighted average ending interest rate of 12.31 . Based on the amounts outstanding under our Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024, a 100 basis-point increase in SOFR (or an equivalent successor rate) would increase the Company s annual interest expense by approximately 0.3 million. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required, the Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For information about litigation involving us, see Note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I of this report, which we incorporate by reference into this Item 1 of Part II. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Except as noted below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors , of our 2023 Form 10-K. A significant portion of our revenues may be concentrated among a small number of projects. From time to time in any given period, a significant percentage of our revenues may be attributable to a limited number of contracts, customers or projects. A reduction in scale, a delay in scheduled work, the termination of a material contract, or the loss of a major customer could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, our revenue and results of operations. Furthermore, even if the ultimate amount of our contract revenue attributable to a particular project remains the same, delays in scheduled work may impact the timing of the recognition of our contract revenues and profits. In addition, in many cases, we work 

 42 

Table of Contents 
 as a subcontractor or among a team of contractors. Our ability to timely execute on our work is often affected by scheduling changes or contract performance by our co-contractors, all of which are outside of our control. For example, our Pearl Harbor Project for the United States Navy, our portion of which totals 447.6 million, and our design-build contract for the Grand Bahama Shipyard totaling over 100.0 million may concentrate our revenues. To the extent we experience any delays in the Pearl Harbor Project, the Grand Bahama Shipyard or any other significant project, anticipated revenue or profits associated with that project may shift into future periods, which may impact the accuracy of our guidance. The timing and funding of new contracts may result in volatility in our cash flow and profitability. These factors as well as others that may cause our actual financial results to vary from any publicly disclosed earnings guidance and forecasts are outside of our control. Our revenues are generated from project-based work. It is generally very difficult to predict the timing and source of awarded contracts, and the timing of revenue under awarded contracts. The selection of, timing of, or failure to obtain projects, delays in awards of projects, the rebidding or termination of projects due to budget overruns, or the cancellations of projects or delays in completion of contracts could result in the under-utilization of our assets and reduce our cash flows and profitability, or cause revenues to be shifted further into the future. Even if we are awarded contracts, we face additional risks that could affect whether, or when, work will begin. For example, some of our contracts are subject to financing and other contingencies that may delay or result in termination of projects. This may make it difficult to match workforce size and equipment location with contract needs. In some cases, we may be required to bear the cost of a readily available workforce and fleet of equipment that is larger than needed at the time, resulting in unpredictability in our cash flow, expenses and profitability. If an expected contract award or the related notice to proceed is delayed or not received, we could incur substantial costs without receipt of any corresponding revenues, or the revenues could appear in periods later than expected. Delays by our customers in obtaining required approvals and permits for their infrastructure projects may delay their awarding contracts for those projects and once awarded, the ability to commence construction under those contracts. Moreover, construction projects for which our services are contracted may require significant expenditures by us prior to receipt of relevant payments by a customer and may expose us to potential credit risk if such customer should encounter financial difficulties. Such expenditures could reduce our cash flows and necessitate increased borrowings under our Credit Agreement. In addition, a change in the timing of a construction project may impact future revenue. If a project is delayed, revenue that we expect to receive may appear in periods later than we initially expected, which may impact the accuracy of our guidance. Finally, the winding down or completion of work on significant projects that were active in previous periods will reduce our revenue and earnings if such significant projects have not been replaced in the current period. From time to time, we may publicly provide earnings or other forms of guidance, which reflect our predictions about future revenue, operating costs and capital structure, among other factors. Any such predictions may be impacted by these factors as well as others that are beyond our control and might not turn out to be accurate. We may not be able to enter into contracts associated with our pipeline of opportunities, or realize any revenue associated with our pipeline of opportunities. As of September 30, 2024, we had a pipeline of opportunities of 13.0 billion. We define our pipeline of opportunities as specific projects that we have identified and are tracking as projects of interest. Our pipeline of opportunities does not represent binding contracts with third parties. Before we can capitalize on our pipeline of opportunities, we would have to enter into contracts with third parties, or otherwise be 

 43 

Table of Contents 
 selected to perform services, for the particular project identified in our pipeline of opportunities. We cannot provide any assurance that we will ultimately enter into a contract with a third party or provide services with respect to any particular opportunity. We may be unable to enter into contracts or perform services associated with an opportunity for a variety of reasons, including being outbid, not having the ability to satisfy customer or contract requirements, resource constraints, or bonding requirements. Even if we enter into a contract associated with an opportunity, it may be for a contract amount that is lower than the amount we estimated and included in our pipeline. Furthermore, even if we are ultimately awarded contracts in our pipeline of opportunities, we cannot guarantee that the revenue associated with those projects will be realized, or if realized, will result in positive earnings. Further, such contracts would become subject to the typical risks associated with our projects, such as execution risk, counter-party risk, delays, cancellations, cost-overruns, weather conditions, natural disasters, health epidemics, and cybersecurity incidents, among others.
