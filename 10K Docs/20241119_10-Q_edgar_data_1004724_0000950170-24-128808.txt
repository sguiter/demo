million in unrestricted cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's cash provided by operating activities was million primarily due to the timing of accounts payable and accrued expense payments.. The Company is seeking collection of the past due rent. In addition, management is working to expedite the time it takes to collect and receive aged patient receivables. Cash flow from operations in the future will be based on the operational performance of the facilities under the company's management, Glenvue and Meadowood. Series A Preferred Stock Exchange Offer In connection with the completion of the Exchange Offer and the implementation of the Series A Charter Amendments and the Series B Charter Amendments, the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock was reduced, accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Se ries A Preferred Stock were eliminated and future dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock were eliminated. As a result, million in accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock were eliminated and, as of September 30, 2024, there are no accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.

The Company anticipates net principal repayments of approximately million during the next twelve-month period, approximately million of routine debt service amortization, million of insurance financing amortization, and million payment of bond debt. Debt Covenant Compliance Evaluation of the Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern Under the accounting guidance related to the presentation of financial statements, the Company is required to evaluate, on a quarterly basis, whether or not the Company's current financial condition, including its sources of liquidity at the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued, will enable the Company to meet its obligations as they come due arising within one year of the date of the issuance of the Company's consolidated financial statements and to make a determination as to whether or not it is probable, under the application of this accounting guidance, that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash on hand of million. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of million and had million of net cash provided by operations for the period, respectively. The Company received a notice of default under one USDA loan secured by Southland and an SBA loan secured by Southland totaling million. The lender accelerated the maturity dates and is requesting for the loans to be paid in full plus unpaid interest and late fees immediately. We are working with the lender to reach a forbearance agreement and think it is likely we will reach an agreement. On November 8, 2024, Company obtained a line of credit and intends to pay all unpaid principal and interest payments to get back into compliance with the loan documents. These conditions raise doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as the Company will need additional debt or equity financing or a combination of both to continue its operations and meet its financial obligations for twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements were issued if we do not obtain a forbearance agreement with the lender. We think it is likely we will reach an agreement. We may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding. We expect to incur continuing losses for the foreseeable future. Any additional debt or equity financing that the Company obtains may substantially dilute the ownership held by our existing stockholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular investor. The Company may be unable to access further equity or debt financing when needed or obtain additional financing under acceptable terms, if at all. We may decide to raise additional capital through a variety of sources in the short-term and in the long-term, including but not limited to:

Escrow deposits In connection with financing secured through the Company's lenders, several wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company are required to make monthly escrow deposits for taxes and insurance. Restricted cash for debt obligations In compliance with certain financing and insurance agreements, the Company and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company are required to deposit cash held as collateral by the lender or in escrow with certain designated financial institutions.

 Overview 
 
 Regional Health Properties, Inc., a Georgia corporation, is a self-managed real estate investment company that invests primarily in real estate purposed for long-term care and senior housing. We operate through two reportable segments: Real Estate and Healthcare Services. Our Real Estate segment consists of real estate investments in skilled nursing and senior housing facilities. We fund our real estate investments primarily through: (1) operational cash flow, (2) mortgages, and (3) sale of equity securities. Our Healthcare Services segment is comprised of an entity set up to operate our facilities as needed under our Portfolio Stabilization measures. 
 
 While the Company is a self-managed real estate investment company, the Company, when business conditions require, may undertake portfolio stabilization measures, such as operating a previously leased facility. 

Real Estate Portfolio 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had investments of approximately 66.5 million in eleven health care real estate properties and one leased property. We currently own eleven properties, consisting of nine skilled nursing facilities SNFs and two multi-service facilities. Nine facilities are pursuant to triple-net leases, one is managed by an external manager, and one is managed internally by the Company. The Company has one leased facility that is subleased pursuant to a triple-net lease. 
 
 Skilled nursing facilities. SNFs provide services that include daily nursing, therapeutic rehabilitation, social services, activities, housekeeping, nutrition, medication management and administrative services for individuals requiring certain assistance for activities in daily living. A typical skilled nursing facility includes mostly one and two bed units, each equipped with a private or shared bathroom and community dining facilities. 
 
 28 

Multi-Service Campuses. Multi-service campuses generally include some combination of co-located skilled nursing, independent living, assisted living and/or memory care units all housed at a single location and operated as a continuum of care.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 The Company intends to pursue measures to grow its operations, streamline its cost infrastructure and otherwise increase liquidity, including: (i) refinancing or repaying debt to reduce interest costs and mandatory principal repayments, with such repayment to be funded through potentially expanding borrowing arrangements with certain lenders; (ii) increasing future lease revenue through acquisitions and investments in existing properties; (iii) modifying the terms of existing leases; (iv) replacing certain tenants who default on their lease payment terms; and (v) reducing other and general and administrative expenses. 
 Management anticipates access to several sources of liquidity, including cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and debt refinancing during the twelve months following the date of this filing. The Company has committed to a plan to sell the Mt. Trace Property to increase cash available for operations and future investments. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 0.5 million in unrestricted cash and 2.0 million of net accounts receivable, mainly consisting of patient accounts receivables and rent receivables. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's net cash provided by operating activities was 1.0 million primarily due timing of payments of accounts payable. Management anticipates collecting a portion of the past due rent after the filing date and is currently negotiating various methods to collect the remaining unpaid rent. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an estimated allowance of 2.2 million against a gross accounts receivable of 4.2 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 49.7 million in indebtedness, net of 1.0 million deferred financing costs and unamortized discounts. The Company anticipates net principal repayments of approximately 2.2 million during the next 
 33 

twelve-month period, approximately 1.6 million of routine debt service amortization, 0.4 million of insurance financing amortization, and 0.2 million payment of bond debt. 
 Series A Preferred Stock Exchange Offer 
 On June 30, 2023, the Company closed the Company s offer to exchange (the Exchange Offer any and all outstanding shares of the Company s 10.875 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the Series A Preferred Stock for newly issued shares of the Company s Series B Preferred Stock. In connection with the completion of the Exchange Offer and the implementation of the Series A Charter Amendments and the Series B Charter Amendments, the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock was reduced, accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock were eliminated and future dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock were eliminated. As a result, 50.4 million in accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock were eliminated and, as of September 30, 2024, there are no accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. For further information regarding the Exchange Offer, Series A Charter Amendments and Series B Charter Amendments, see Note 9 Common and Preferred Stock . As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not redeemed any Series B Preferred Stock. 
 
 In early 2020, the Company began ongoing efforts to investigate alternatives to retire or refinance our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock through privately negotiated transactions, open market repurchases, redemptions, exchange offers, tender offers, or otherwise. 
 
 Costs associated with these efforts have been expensed as incurred in Other expense, net and there were no expenses incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and there were 0.5 million for the nine months ended nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Series A Preferred Dividend Suspension 
 
 Prior to the Exchange Offer, as discussed above, we suspended the quarterly dividend payment with respect to our Series A Preferred Stock commencing with the fourth quarter of 2017, and on June 8, 2018, the Board suspended quarterly dividend payments indefinitely with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock. The dividend suspension provided the Company with additional funds to meet its ongoing liquidity needs. As the Company had failed to pay cash dividends on the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in full for more than four dividends periods, the annual dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock for the fifth and future missed dividend periods had increased to 12.875 , which was equivalent to approximately 3.20 per share each year, commencing on the first day after the missed fourth quarterly payment (October 1, 2018) and continuing until the second consecutive dividend payment date following such time as the Company had paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in full in cash. As discussed above, in connection with the completion of the Exchange Offer, accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock were eliminated. 
 
 Debt Covenant Compliance 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the various financial and administrative covenants under the Company's outstanding credit related instruments with the exception of a notice of default under two USDA loans secured by the Southland and Mt. Trace Property and an SBA loan secured by Southland. On October 25, 2024, the Company received a notice of acceleration and demand for payment from the lenders of Southland stating that the covenants of the deed of trust have been violated for failure to pay principal and interest. The lender accelerated the maturity dates and is requesting for the loans to be paid in full plus unpaid interest and late fees immediately. We are working with the lender to reach a forbearance agreement and think it is likely we will reach an agreement. On November 8, 2024, Company obtained a line of credit and intends to pay all unpaid principal and interest payments to get back into compliance with the loan documents. The Company is working with the lender of the Mt. Trace Property to get back into compliance with the loan documents and received a waiver in November 2024. 
 Evaluation of the Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 Under the accounting guidance related to the presentation of financial statements, the Company is required to evaluate, on a quarterly basis, whether or not the Company's current financial condition, including its sources of liquidity at the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued, will enable the Company to meet its obligations as they come due arising within one year of the date of the issuance of the Company's consolidated financial statements and to make a determination as to whether or not it is probable, under the application of this accounting guidance, that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. 
 
 34 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash on hand of 0.5 million. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 84.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of 2.7 million and had 1.0 million of net cash provided by operations for the period, respectively. The Company received a notice of default under one USDA loan secured by Southland and an SBA loan secured by Southland totaling 4.1 million. On October 25, 2024, the Company received a notice of acceleration and demand for payment from the lenders of Southland stating that the covenants of the deed of trust have been violated for failure to pay principal and interest. The lender accelerated the maturity dates and is requesting for the loans to be paid in full plus unpaid interest and late fees immediately. We are working with the lender to reach a forbearance agreement and think it is likely we will reach an agreement. On November 8, 2024, Company obtained a line of credit and intends to pay all unpaid principal and interest payments to get back into compliance with the loan documents. 
 These conditions raise doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as the Company will need additional debt or equity financing or a combination of both to continue its operations and meet its financial obligations for twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements were issued if we do not obtain a forbearance agreement with the lender. We think it is likely we will reach an agreement. 
 We may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding. We expect to incur continuing losses for the foreseeable future. 
 Any additional debt or equity financing that the Company obtains may substantially dilute the ownership held by our existing stockholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular investor. The Company may be unable to access further equity or debt financing when needed or obtain additional financing under acceptable terms, if at all. 
 We may decide to raise additional capital through a variety of sources in the short-term and in the long-term, including but not limited to: 
 the public equity markets; 

private equity financings; 

collaborative arrangements; 

asset sales; and/or 

public or private debt. 

If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 For additional information regarding the Company's liquidity, see Note 2 Liquidity and Note 9 Senior Debt and other debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 herein.

 Net cash used in investing activities was approximately 0.9 million. The negative cash flow was mainly from reclassified capital expenditures, new equipment, and finished capital expense projects. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was approximately 1.8 million. The cash was used to make routine payments totaling 1.8 million for our debt obligations. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Guarantee 
 The Company subleased five facilities located in Ohio to the Aspire Sublessees, formerly affiliated with MSTC Development Inc., pursuant to the Aspire Subleases, whereby the Aspire Sublessees took possession of, and commenced operating, the Aspire Facilities as subtenant. The Company agreed to indemnify Aspire against any and all liabilities imposed on them as arising from the former operator, capped at 8.0 million. The Company has assessed the fair value of the indemnity agreements as not material to the financial statements at September 30, 2024. For further information see Note 6 Leases , to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 herein and also and Note 6 Leases included in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Article 8 of Regulation S-X. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we review our judgments and estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to doubtful accounts, income taxes, stock compensation, intangible assets and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, business knowledge and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time. Actual results may vary from our estimates. These estimates are evaluated by management and revised as circumstances change. 
 For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, see Note 1 Organization and Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 herein.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Disclosure in response to Item 3 of Form 10-Q is not required to be provided by smaller reporting companies. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Senior Vice President (principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report (the "Evaluation Date"). Based on such evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 Part II. Oth er Information 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 The Company is a defendant in various legal actions and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims that the services the Company provided during the time it operated skilled nursing facilities resulted in injury or death to patients. Although the Company settles cases from time to time when settlement can be achieved on a reasonable basis, the Company vigorously defends any matter in which it believes the claims lack merit and the Company has a reasonable chance to prevail at trial or in arbitration. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. There is no assurance that the outcomes of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition. Although arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business, certain of these matters are described in "Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies" . 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors . 
 For a detailed description of certain risk factors that could affect our business, operations and financial condition, see Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, included in the Annual Report, as supplemented and modified by the risk factors set forth below in this Item 1A. The risk factors described in the Annual Report and this Quarterly Report (collectively, the Risk Factors do not describe all risks applicable to our business, and we intend it only as a summary of certain material factors. The Risk Factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report because the Risk Factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of the common stock, no par value per share (the "common stock"), the Series A Redeemable Preferred Shares, no par value per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock"), and the 12.5 Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, no par value per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), could decline. 
 There are no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 other than as set forth below. 
 
 Healthcare reform legislation impacts cannot accurately be predicted and could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 37 

We and the healthcare operators leasing our properties depend on the healthcare industry and are susceptible to risks associated with healthcare reform. Legislative proposals are introduced each year that would introduce major changes in the healthcare system, both nationally and at the state level. For example, we believe that efforts may be made to, among other things, transition Federal payment programs further in the direction of value based care, but we cannot predict whether or in what form any of these measures may be enacted, or what effect they would have on our business or the businesses of our tenants if enacted. Efforts may also be made to reduce the age at which individuals become eligible for Medicare, which could have an adverse impact on our tenants because Medicare sometimes reimburses long term care providers at rates lower than those paid by commercial payors. In addition, the Biden Administration announced a focus on implementing minimum staffing requirements and increased inspections as part of nursing home reforms announced in the 2022 State of the Union Address. On April 22, 2024, CMS issued a final rule regarding minimum staffing requirements and increased inspections at nursing homes in order to establish comprehensive nurse staffing requirements. The rule consists of three core staffing requirements: (1) overall minimum standard of 3.48 total nurse staff hours per resident day; (2) minimum nurse staffing standards of 0.55 hours per resident day for registered nurses and 2.45 hours of care from a certified nurse s aid per resident per day; and (3) a requirement to have a registered nurse onsite 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The rule includes a staggered implementation approach for which CMS will publish additional details on compliance as the implementation dates approach. The rule also includes possible waivers and temporary hardship exemptions for select facilities, however no funding for the additional staff will be provided. We are currently evaluating the impact of the rule, but believe the unfunded mandate to increase staff may have a material and adverse impact on the financial condition of our tenants. We cannot predict whether any future legislation related to staffing will be adopted or, if adopted, the impact such legislation may have on our tenants or our business. 
 
 Our tenants are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry that include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights and insurance, fraudulent or abusive behavior, labor and employment issues and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. See Government Regulation in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, for more information. If our tenants or operators fail to comply with the laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant operational changes. The cost to comply with these laws, regulations and other requirements results in increased costs of doing business for our tenants and operators. If our tenants are unable to offset these increased costs, the operating results and financial condition of our tenants will be adversely impacted and they may be unable to satisfy their rent obligations to us. 
 
 We believe that additional resources may be dedicated to regulatory enforcement, which could further increase our tenants costs of doing business and negatively impact their ability to pay their rent obligations to us. Changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have also resulted in a significant increase in inspection rates, citations of regulatory deficiencies and sanctions, including terminations from Medicare and Medicaid programs, bars on Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and criminal penalties. Our tenants and operators could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation, lawsuit or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. Additionally, if our tenants residents do not have insurance, it could adversely impact the tenants ability to satisfy their obligation to us. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equit y Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 None. 
 Item 3. Defaults upo n Senior Securities. 
 In connection with the completion of the Exchange Offer and the implementation of the Series A Charter Amendments and the Series B Charter Amendments, the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock was reduced, accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock were eliminated and future dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock were eliminated. As a result, 50.4 million in accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock were eliminated and, as of September 30, 2024, there are no accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. For further information regarding the Exchange Offer, Series A Charter Amendments and Series B Charter Amendments, see Note 2 Liquidity and Note 9 Common and Preferred Stock to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 herein.

Item 4. Mine Safe ty Disclosures. 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 5. Other Information. 
 NYSE American Listing 
 
 On May 10, 2023, we received a letter from the NYSE American notifying us that we were not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(ii) of the NYSE American Company Guide. As a result, we became subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the NYSE American Company Guide. On June 9, 2023, we submitted a plan to the NYSE American advising of actions we have taken or will take to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by November 10, 2024. On June 29, 2023, we received a letter from the NYSE American notifying us that we were not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) of the NYSE Company Guide. On August 1, 2023, we received a letter (the Acceptance Letter from the NYSE American notifying us that the compliance plan has been accepted. On November 11, 2024, the NYSE Regulation determined that the Company is no longer suitable for listing pursuant to Section 1009(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide as the Company was unable to demonstrate that it had regained compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i) and (ii) of the NYSE American Company Guide by the end of the maximum 18-month compliance plan period, which expired on November 10, 2024. The Company has a right to a review of staff s determination to delist the Company s Securities by the Listings Qualifications Panel of the Committee for Review of the Board of Directors of the Exchange. Following such appeal, a decision by the Listings Qualifications Panel will be made and announced by NYSE American regarding either proceeding with suspension and delisting or continued trading in the Company s Securities. The Company s request for such a review must be made by November 18, 2024. The Company intends to appeal such determination and will continue with the plan to regain compliance. The Company expects the Securities to continue to trade on NYSE American during the appeal process. 
 
 Regional Health s common stock and Series A Preferred Stock will continue to be listed on the NYSE American while it attempts to regain compliance with the continued listing standard noted, subject to Regional Health s compliance with other continued listing requirements. The common stock and Series A Preferred Stock will continue to trade under the symbols RHE and RHE-PA, respectively, but will each have an added designation of .BC to indicate that Regional Health is not in compliance with the NYSE American s continued listing standards. 
 
 Trading Arrangement 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, none of the Company s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended).
