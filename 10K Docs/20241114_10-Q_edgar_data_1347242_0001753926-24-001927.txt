at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the Company had available cash
and cash equivalents of and net working capital of . The Company anticipates operating losses to continue
for the foreseeable future due to, among other things, costs related to: research, development of product candidates, conducting
preclinical studies and clinical trials, and administrative organization. These funds, and our funds available under existing
government contracts, may not be sufficient to enable us to meet our obligations as they come due at least for the next twelve
months from the issuance date of these financial statements. 

If
we are unable to obtain additional capital (which is not assured at this time), our long-term business plan may not be accomplished,
and we may be forced to curtail or cease operations. These factors individually and collectively raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments
that may result from this uncertainty.

stock option plan, and shares of Common Stock underlying option awards that may be issuable under the 2020 stock option
plan. Incentive stock options are granted with an exercise price determined by the Company s board of directors (the Board ).
The terms of the vesting of such options, including termination, are as set forth in the Stock Option Plans and their respective
award agreements. Such stock options generally expire 10 years from the date of the grant. Subject to certain exceptions for grants
made to employees who are large stockholders, stock options granted under the Stock Option Plans have an exercise price not less
than the fair market value of the underlying Common Stock on the date of such grant. If an employee leaves the Company prior to
fully vesting their option awards and the remaining unvested portion is considered forfeited, the earlier recognition of the unvested
shares is reversed during the period of forfeiture. As of September 30, 2024, there were in unrecognized compensation
costs related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted, to be recognized over the remaining vesting period
of less than one year.

Notice
of Failure to Satisfy Nasdaq Minimum Bid Price Requirement 

As
disclosed in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 19, 2024, on April 17, 2024, the
Company received a written notification (the April Nasdaq Letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying the Company that, based upon the closing bid price of the Common Stock for the last 30
consecutive business days, the Company was not in compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00
per share of its Common Stock, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Price
Requirement ). The April Nasdaq Letter had no immediate effect on the listing of the Common Stock, which continues to
trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

Nasdaq provided the Company with 180 calendar days, or until October 14, 2024, to regain compliance with
the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. 

As disclosed in the
Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 23, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Staff
on August 21, 2024 stating that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires companies listed
on the Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain a minimum of 2,500,000 in stockholders equity for continued listing (the Stockholders 
Equity Requirement ). The Company reported stockholders equity of 1,703,798 in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and, as a result, it was not in compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement. 

As
disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 18, 2024, the Staff notified the Company on October
16, 2024 that it would delist the Common Stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, and in response, the Company timely requested an
appeal of such notice to a Nasdaq hearing panel (the Panel ). The Nasdaq hearing date has been set for December 12,
2024. While the appeal process is pending, the suspension of trading of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market will continue
to be stayed until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a decision. See also Note 15, Subsequent Events, for more
information regarding the Reverse Stock Split.

Commitments 

The
Company enters into contracts in the normal course of business with contract research organizations CROs ), contract
manufacturing organizations, universities, and other third parties for preclinical research studies, clinical trials and testing
and manufacturing services. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancellable by us upon
prior written notice although, purchase orders for clinical materials are generally non-cancellable. Payments due upon cancellation

up to the date of cancellation or upon the completion of a manufacturing run.

for each period. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was
primarily due to the full valuation allowance against the Company s net deferred tax assets. 

The
Company regularly evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely
than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. Because of our cumulative losses, substantially all
of the deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We
have not paid income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2023. The income tax provision attributable to loss before income tax
benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory
rate of as a result of the following:

pre-funded warrants were exercised and exchanged for the same number of shares of Common Stock. 

On November 7, 2024,
the Company, acting pursuant to authority received at an annual meeting of its stockholders on September 10, 2024, filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of amendment (the Charter Amendment to the Certificate
of Incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock Split on November 7, 2024. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every eight (8)
shares of Common Stock were exchanged for one (1) share of Common Stock. The Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital
Market on a split-adjusted basis at the start of trading on November 8, 2024. The Reverse Stock Split did not affect the total
number of shares of capital stock, including the Common Stock, that the Company is authorized to issue, which remain as set forth
pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation. The Reverse Stock Split also has a proportionate effect on all other options and
warrants of the Company outstanding as of the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split. 

Net loss per share and all share data
as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock
Split in accordance with ASC 260-10-55-12, Restatement of EPS Data.

Overview 

We
are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing new drugs by reformulating the active agents in existing generic
drugs and optimizing these reformulations for new applications. We believe that this strategy combines many of the cost efficiencies
and risk abatements derived from using existing generic drugs with potential patent protections for our proprietary formulations;
this strategy allows us to expedite, protect, and monetize our product candidates. Additionally, we maintain a therapeutic focus
on diseases with significant, unaddressed morbidity and mortality where no approved drug therapy currently exists. We believe
that this focus can potentially help reduce the cost, time and risk associated with obtaining marketing approval. 

LP-10
is the development name of our reformulation of tacrolimus (an approved generic active agent) specifically optimized for topical
deposition to the internal surface of the urinary bladder lumen using a proprietary drug delivery platform that we have developed
and that we refer to as our metastable liposome drug delivery platform (our Platform ). We are developing LP-10 and
our Platform to be, to our knowledge, the first drug candidate and drug delivery technology that could be successful in treating
cancer survivors who acquire hemorrhagic cystitis. We have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA orphan
drug designation covering LP-10 and plan to apply for additional regulatory designations in the event we achieve qualifying
results in clinical trials for LP-10. Market data exclusivity may be available in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which regulatory
approval is obtained for the Company s product, regardless of patent status. 

The
safety and efficacy of LP-10 was evaluated in a 13-subject, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation, phase 2a clinical trial
in patients experiencing complications associated with a rare but highly morbid disease called radiation-induced hemorrhagic
cystitis or radiation cystitis. This phase 2a clinical trial commenced on February 15, 2021, and we reported
the trial s summary results in the first quarter of 2023. We met with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 regarding the
LP-10 clinical trial results, and on April 3, 2024, the FDA granted a Type C meeting request to discuss our proposed Phase-2b
clinical trial design for the evaluation of LP-10. We have submitted to the FDA a full Phase 2b multi-center prospective double-blind placebo controlled
trial that is ready to initiate. 

There
is currently no FDA approved drug therapy available for radiation cystitis patients, who are all cancer survivors who received
pelvic radiation therapy to treat solid pelvic tumors, including prostate and ovarian cancers, and who are now dealing with therapy-associated
complications, including urinary bleeding (a radiation cystitis symptom). LP-10 s active ingredient, tacrolimus, which has
a well-known pharmacology and toxicology, addresses a reduction (or cessation) of uncontrolled urinary bleeding. 

14 

In the fourth quarter of 2023, we received IND approval from the FDA for LP-310, our product for the treatment
of oral lichen planus OLP ). We have begun the clinical trial process for LP-310, and initiated the first clinical
site in the second quarter of 2024. Three patients have completed the trial, and we expect topline results before the end of 2024.
OLP is a chronic, T-cell-mediated, autoimmune oral mucosal disease, and LP-310 contains tacrolimus which inhibits T-lymphocyte
activation. To date, upon review of relevant FDA public data resources on approved drugs and biologics, we are not aware of any
other liposomal products developed to treat such disease. 

In
the first quarter of 2024, we received IND approval from the FDA for LP-410, our phase-1/2a product, for the treatment of oral
graft-versus-host disease GVHD ). LP-410 is an oral rinse, similar to LP-310, but will have a different containment
system. Hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT is used to treat a wide range of malignancies, hematologic and
immune deficiency states, and autoimmune diseases. GVHD is a clinical syndrome where donor-derived immunocompetent T-cells react
against patient tissues directly or through exaggerated inflammatory responses following HCT. Lipella has developed LP-410 for
the topical delivery directly to the mouth surface. LP-410 targets the underlying mechanisms of oral GVHD, potentially providing
a safe and effective treatment option for affected individuals. Lipella received orphan drug designation approval
on November 11, 2023 for tacrolimus for the treatment of oral GVHD. 

Since our inception in 2005, we have focused primarily on business planning and progressing our lead product
candidates, including progressing LP-10 through clinical development, raising capital, organizing and staffing the Company. On
December 22, 2022, we completed our initial public offering (the IPO and issued an aggregate of 152,174 shares of
Common Stock at a price of 46 per share, as retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split. The aggregate net proceeds from
the IPO were approximately 5.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 630,000 and offering
expenses of approximately 1.16 million. 

Recent
Developments 

Nasdaq Notifications 

As previously disclosed, on April 17, 2024,

Grants and Other
Revenue 

We
have not yet commercialized any products and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several
years. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized revenue from a grant awarded by the National Institutes
of Health NIH in September of 2022 (the 2022 NIH Grant ), which was an award of an aggregate of 673,000.
NIH approved an additional year of funding under the 2022 NIH Grant in June 2023, increasing the total funding provided under
the 2022 NIH Grant to 1,353,000. 

We
recognize revenue from grants when the related costs are incurred and the right to payment is realized. For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, we earned 80,000 in connection with the 2022 NIH Grant, recognized as revenue, compared with 104,000 of
revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in annual grant revenue of 24,000 was driven by lower subcontractor
costs on the grant work. 

Operating Expenses 

Our
operating expenses consist of (i) R D expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses. 

Research and Development
Expenses 

R D
costs primarily consist of direct costs associated with consultants and materials, biologic storage, third party CRO costs and
contract development and manufacturing expenses, salaries and other personnel-related expenses. R D costs are expensed as
incurred. More specifically, these costs include: 

costs of funding research performed by third parties that conduct
 research and development and nonclinical and clinical activities on our behalf; 

costs of manufacturing drug supply and drug product; 

costs of conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials
 of our product candidates; 

consulting and professional fees related to research and development
 activities, including equity-based compensation to non-employees; 

costs related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements;
 and 

employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and
 stock-based compensation expense for our research and development personnel. 

Costs
for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data, such
as information provided to us by our vendors, and analyzing the progress of our nonclinical and clinical studies or other services
performed. Significant judgment and estimates are made in determining the accrued expense balances at the end of any reporting
period. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in R D activities are recorded
as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed,
or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered. 

We
expect that our R D expenses will increase substantially in connection with our clinical development activities for our LP-10
and LP-310 programs. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will
be necessary to complete the clinical development of, or obtain regulatory approval for, any of our current or future product
candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including
the specific factors set forth in the section of our Annual Report titled Risk Factors. If any events described
in the applicable risk factors included in the section of our Annual Report titled Risk Factors occur, then the
costs and timing associated with the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change. We may never succeed
in obtaining regulatory approval for, of commercialization of, LP-10, LP-310, or any of our other product candidates. 

R D expenses increased by approximately 213,000, to 1,047,000, for the three months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 833,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in R D expenses was attributable
to an increase in stock option expense of 40,000, related to partial vesting of the March 2024 option grants, as well as an increase
in outside services of 131,000 for clinical study trials. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, personnel costs increased
by 16,000, and indirect costs related to operational overhead and employee benefits increased 12,000, and supplies for lab and
clinical trial work increased by approximately 14,000, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

16 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of management and business consultants and other related costs, including stock-based
compensation. General and administrative expenses also include board of directors expenses and professional fees for legal,
patent, consulting, accounting, auditing, tax services and insurance costs. 

There were 493,000 of general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to 628,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 135,000. Outside services, including legal and
investor relations services, decreased by approximately 56,000, and Board compensation decreased by 125,000 as compared to the
quarter ended September 30, 2023. This was offset by an increase in stock option expense of 41,000 compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2023, related to the partial vesting of the March 2024 option grants. 

Net Other Income
(Expense) 

Net other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 15,000, as compared to 33,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change reflected an approximately 18,000 decrease in interest income on the Company s
short term investment portfolio, driven by lower investment balances.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we earned 363,000 in connection with a grant from the NIH,
recognized as revenue. We received 329,000 in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in annual grant
revenue from 2023 to 2024 of 34,000 is related to both the amount of time spent on the grant project, as well as increased salaries
and overhead costs associated.

R D expenses decreased by approximately 34,000, with expenses of 2,551,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, versus 2,585,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in R D expenses was primarily
attributable to a decrease in stock option expense versus the prior year by 431,000. This was offset by increases in 2024 of indirect
overhead costs of 144,000, including employee benefits, overhead and facility related costs, office and lab expenses and supplies.
There was also an increase in outside services of 233,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, related to planning and launching our current clinical trial. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses were approximately 1,441,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 1,760,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 319,000,
including a decrease in stock option expense of 256,000, with higher costs in the prior year related to our June 2023 option grants
to employees and directors. Simultaneously, board compensation decreased by 125,000, and there was an increase in outside services
of 270,000, which includes investor relations and other shareholder services, offset by a decrease in legal fees of 205,000. 

Net
Other Income (Expense) 

Net other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 55,000, as compared to 86,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This balance primarily included (i) cash interest income, (ii) unrealized loss on investments,
and (iii) non-cash interest expense on related party notes in 2023. A higher cash investment balance in 2023 resulted in a decrease
of 42,000 in interest on short term investments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. This was offset by a decrease in interest expense on related party notes of 11,000, due to a reduction in
the balance of debt outstanding. See Note 7 of the notes to our unaudited condensed financial statements in this Form 10-Q as well
as Note 7 of the notes to our financial statements in our Annual Report for details of such related party notes and accrued interest
at the respective periods. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Sources
of Liquidity 

We
have not yet commercialized any products, and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several
years, if at all. Cash and cash equivalents totaled 1,353,734 as of September 30, 2024. We consider all highly liquid investments
that mature in 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 

We
have incurred operating losses and experienced negative operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the
year ended December 31, 2023, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Our net loss
totaled 3,574,592 and 3,930,081 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, and 4,618,965 for the year
ended December 31, 2023. 

Historically,
we have financed our operations through a combination of grant revenue and equity financing, however our goals for the foreseeable
future will likely require significant equity financing. Our ability to achieve significant profitability depends on our ability
to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize, LP-10 and/or our
other product candidates, which may not occur for several years, if ever. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly
from quarter to quarter.

Net
Cash (Used) Provided in Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 2,960,000. This comprised a net
loss for the period of approximately 3,574,000, and increased prepaid expenses (primarily insurance policies, outside services,
and clinical trial operations services) of 592,000, offset by increased operating liabilities of 333,000. There were also non-cash
adjustments reducing the net loss by 669,000 in stock option expense and 200,000 in shares of Common Stock issued for services. 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 2,423,000. This comprised a net
loss for the period of approximately 3,930,000, and decreased operating liabilities of 383,000, offset by decreases in the following
assets: grants receivable of 60,000 and prepaid expenses (primarily insurance policies and consulting services) of 356,000.
There were also and noncash adjustments to net loss of 1,355,000 in stock option expense. 

Net
Cash (Used) Provided by Investing Activities 

There was no cash used
in investing activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash
of 14,000 was invested in the purchase of laboratory equipment. 

Net Cash (Used) Provided by Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 1,020,000, received for the issuance of Common
Stock. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 275,000 in cash, of which 25,000
was used to fully repay a line of credit and 250,000 was used to fully repay a related party note. 

Funding
Requirements 

We
expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing R D activities, particularly as we continue R D,
advance clinical trials of LP-10 and advance the preclinical development of our other programs, including LP-310. In addition,
we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we expect to incur substantial
operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future. 

Based
on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations
and capital expenses into 2025. However, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong,
and we could exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect. 

Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of LP-10, LP-310 and our other
and future product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding
requirements will depend on, and could increase significantly as a result of, many factors, including, but not limited to, those
referenced above in Results of Operations Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . 

Going
Concern 

The
unaudited condensed financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have generated losses from operations since inception.
The Company expects operating losses to continue in the foreseeable future because of additional costs and expenses related to
research and development activities, plans to expand its product portfolio, and increasing its market share. The Company s
ability to transition attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support its
cost structure. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash flows from operations
and the anticipated growth of our business. 

Management
of the Company may raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt. There can be no assurance that such
financing will be available at terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations
and raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to achieve its intended business
objectives. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern. 

19 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
did not have during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or the year ended December 31, 2023, and we do not currently have,
any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
did not have during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023, and we do not currently have, any
material contractual obligations, such as license agreements or similar arrangements, other than as described below and in the
financial notes to our unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report. 

Employment
Agreements 

We
are party to employment agreements with each of Drs. Kaufman and Chancellor and Mr. Johnston, executive officers of the Company,
the material terms of each of which are described in the section entitled Executive Compensation Executive Employment
Agreements of our Annual Report, which descriptions are supplemented by the disclosure of the August 2023 amendments
to our agreements with Drs. Kaufman and Chancellor contained in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 8,
2023, and as described in our Annual Report. 

Lease
Agreement 

We
are party to a lease agreement, dated June 1, 2019, with Bridgeway Development Corporation Bridgeway ), as amended,
for the lease of 2,690 square feet of office and lab and manufacturing space in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania commencing on July 1,
2020 (the Lease ). The Lease term expires on September 30, 2025 and we have the right to exercise a one-time option
to extend the Lease term for an additional five-year term. The annual base rent under the Lease is approximately 66,000. On July
26, 2023, the Company entered into a second lease for additional space on the fourth floor of the same building (the Fourth
Floor Lease, and together with the Lease, the Leases ), commencing August 1, 2023 and co-terminating with
the Lease on June 30, 2025. Annual rent under the Fourth Floor Lease was approximately 28,000. As space became available in the
immediate proximity to our existing offices at the beginning of 2024, we terminated the Fourth Floor Lease upon mutual agreement
with the landlord and replaced it with a lease for Suite 504 the Suite 504 Lease ). The Suite 504 Lease is effective
January 1, 2024 and the term co-terminates with the Lease. The annual base rent for the current year for the Suite 504 Lease is
approximately 29,000. See Note 13 of the notes to our unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for
more details. 

20 

Service
Agreements 

We enter into service agreements in the normal course of business with CROs and for clinical trials, preclinical
research studies and testing, manufacturing, and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts do not contain
any minimum purchase commitments. Certain agreements provide for termination rights subject to termination fees or wind down costs.
Under such agreements, we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors, mainly to reimburse them for their unrecoverable
outlays incurred prior to cancellation. The exact amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination, and the
exact terms of the relevant agreement and cannot be reasonably estimated. The expense we incurred pursuant to these agreements
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 694,000, which was an increase of approximately 93,000 over the
 601,000 expense incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The spending was primarily attributable to expenses relating
to our ongoing research and development work, and costs related to our clinical trials for LP-310 in 2024. in During the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, spending was primarily related to oral toxicology testing for LP-310, along with FDA and grant writing
support expenses. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

This
management s discussion and analysis is based on our unaudited condensed financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited
condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reported periods. We base our estimates on historical
experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments
and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any,
will be reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates. 

While
our accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included in our Annual Report, we
believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments
and estimates. See Note 3 of the notes to our financial statements in our Annual Report for a description of our other significant
accounting policies. 

Accrued Expenses 

As
part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued third-party R D expenses
as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel
to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated
cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our
service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates
of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically
confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates
in our accrued R D expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with R D activities
for which we have not yet been invoiced. 

We
base our expenses related to R D activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes
and contracts with vendors that conduct R D activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject
to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments
made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the R D expense. In accruing
service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each
period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual
or prepaid balance accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future R D activities
are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. 

Although
we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of
services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that
are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such
expenses and the amounts incurred. 

21 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
measure stock-based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the stock-based awards and recognize stock-based compensation
expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period of the
respective award. For non-employee awards, compensation expense is recognized as the services are provided, which is generally
ratably over the vesting period. We account for forfeitures as they occur. On January 1, 2018, we adopted, using the modified
retroactive approach, the guidance of Accounting Standard Update 2018-07, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718)
 Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ASU 2018-07 ), and account for awards to
non-employees using the grant date fair value without subsequent periodic remeasurement. The adoption of ASU 2018-07 did not have
a material effect on our financial statements. 

We
classify stock-based compensation expense in our statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient s
salary and related costs are classified or in which the award recipient s service payments are classified. In future periods,
we expect stock-based compensation expense to increase, due in part to our existing unrecognized stock-based compensation expense
and as we grant additional stock-based awards to continue to attract and retain our employees. 

We
determine the fair value of restricted Common Stock awards granted based on the fair value of our Common Stock. We have historically
determined the fair value of the underlying Common Stock based on input from management and the board of directors and the Company s
enterprise value determined utilizing various methods, including the back-solve method. The total enterprise value,
determined from the back-solve method, is historically then allocated to the various outstanding equity instruments, including
the underlying Common Stock, utilizing the option pricing method OPM or a hybrid of the probability-weighted expected
return method PWERM and the OPM. 

The
fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires
inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option,
the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and our expected dividend yield. As
the public market for our Common Stock has been limited and prior to the IPO there was no such public market, we have historically
determined the volatility for awards granted based on an analysis of reported data for a group of guideline companies that issued
options with substantially similar terms. The expected volatility has been determined using a weighted-average of the historical
volatility measures of this group of guideline companies along with our own. We expect to continue estimating expected volatility
based on the group of guideline companies until we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our own traded stock
price. The expected term of our stock options granted to employees and non-employees has been determined utilizing the simplified 
method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference
to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected
term of the award. We have not paid, and do not anticipate paying, dividends on our Common Stock; therefore, the expected dividend
yield is assumed to be zero. 

As
there was no public market for our Common Stock prior to the IPO, the estimated fair value of our Common Stock prior to our IPO
had been approved by our board of directors, with input from management, as of the date of each award grant, considering our most
recently available independent third-party valuations of our Common Stock and any additional objective and subjective factors
that we believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of each
award grant. We estimated the value of our equity using the market approach and a precedent transaction method which back-solves 
the equity value that yielded a specific value for our Series A Stock. We allocated the equity value to our Common Stock and shares
of our Series A Stock using either an OPM or a hybrid method, which is a hybrid between the OPM and the PWERM. The hybrid method
we utilized estimated the probability-weighted value across multiple scenarios but used the OPM to estimate the allocation of
value within at least one of the scenarios. In addition to the OPM, the hybrid method considered the IPO scenario in which the
shares of our Series A Preferred Stock converted to Common Stock. The future value of the Common Stock in the IPO scenario was
discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate. In the hybrid method, the present value indicated
for each scenario was probability weighted to arrive at an indication of value for our Common Stock. 

22 

In
addition to considering the results of the valuations, management considered various objective and subjective factors to determine
the fair value of our Common Stock as of each grant date, which may be a date later than the most recent third-party valuation
date, including: 

the prices of our Series A Preferred Stock sold to or exchanged
 between outside investors in arm s length transactions, if any, and the rights, preferences and privileges of our Series
 A Preferred Stock as compared to those of our Common Stock, including the liquidation preferences of our Series A Preferred
 Stock; 

the progress of our R D efforts, including the status of
 preclinical studies; 

the lack of liquidity of our equity as a private company; 

our stage of development and business strategy and the material
 risks related to our business and industry; 

the achievement of enterprise milestones; 

the valuation of publicly traded companies in the life sciences
 and biotechnology sectors, as well as recently completed mergers and acquisitions of peer companies; 

any external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry,
 and trends within the biotechnology industry; 

the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the holders
 of our Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock, such as an IPO, or a sale of the Company, given prevailing market conditions;
 and 

the analysis of IPOs and the market performance of similar companies
 in the biopharmaceutical industry. 

There
are significant judgments and estimates inherent in these valuations. These judgments and estimates included assumptions regarding
our future operating performance, the stage of development of our programs, the timing of a potential offering, or other liquidity
event, and the determination of the appropriate valuation methodology at each valuation date. The assumptions underlying these
valuations represented management s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management
judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our
stock-based compensation expense could be materially different. Subsequent to the completion of the IPO, the fair value of our
Common Stock has been determined based on the market price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq. 

With
respect to stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the following table sets forth by grant
date the (i) number of shares of our Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such stock options, (ii) per share exercise price
of such options and (iii) estimated fair value per share of our Common Stock on each such date. We did not grant any shares of
restricted Common Stock during this period.

The

for accounting purposes, were based upon the calculations described above used to determine the fair value of our Common Stock
as of each grant date. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

In
April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS
Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section
7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Therefore, an emerging growth company
can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have
irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will not be required to adopt new
or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. 

23 

In
addition, as an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are
otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include, among other things: 

reduced disclosure about the compensation paid to our executive
 officers; 

not being required to submit to our stockholders advisory
 votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; 

an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the
 pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and 

an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted
 by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation. 

We
may take advantage of these exemptions until such time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be
an emerging growth company upon the earliest of 

the last day of the fiscal year on which we have 1.235 billion
 or more in annual revenue; 

the date on which we become a large accelerated filer 
 (i.e., as of our fiscal year end, the total market value of our common equity securities held by non-affiliates is 700 million
 or more as of September 30); 

the date on which we issue more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible
 debt over a three-year period; or 

the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary
 of the date of the completion of the IPO. 

We
may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these exemptions. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

We
have reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and have determined that, other than as disclosed in Note 3 to our
unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Report, such standards will not have a material impact on our financial
statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

As a smaller reporting
company, as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Company s management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of September 30, 2024. 

24 

Changes in Internal
Controls 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September
30, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations of the
Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the
realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally,
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override
of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur
and not be detected. 

25 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

From
time to time, we may become subject to legal proceedings, claims or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We
are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that in the opinion of our management, if determined adversely to us, would
individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash
flows. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

Our
business, financial condition and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors, both those that are known to us and
identified below and others that may arise from time to time. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones that we face
and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our
business operations. These risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those suggested by forward-looking
statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 (this Report and elsewhere, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. If any of these risk factors should
occur, moreover, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline, and investors in our Common Stock could lose all or
part of their investment. These risk factors, along with other information contained in this Report, should be carefully considered
in evaluating our prospects. 

We
have been notified by Nasdaq of our failure to comply with certain continued listing requirements and, if we are unable to regain
compliance with all applicable continued listing requirements and standards of Nasdaq, our Common Stock could be delisted from
Nasdaq. 

Our
Common Stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial
and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee
requirements, minimum stockholders equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements. 

As
disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on
April 19, 2024, on April 17, 2024, we received
a written notification from the Staff notifying us that we were not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement because
the closing bid price of our Common Stock was below 1.00 per share for the previous thirty (30) consecutive business days. 

As
disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 23, 2024, we received a letter from the Staff on August
21, 2024 stating that we were not in compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement. We reported stockholders 
equity of 1,703,798 in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and, as a result, we were not in
compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement. 

As
disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 18, 2024, the Staff notified us on October 16, 2024
that it would delist the Common Stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, and in response, we timely requested an appeal of such notice
to the Panel. The Nasdaq hearing date has been set for December 12, 2024. While the appeal process is pending, the suspension
of trading of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market will continue to be stayed until the hearing process concludes and
the Panel issues a decision. The Company is diligently working to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and
the Stockholders Equity Requirement. 

There
can be no assurances that we will be able to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or the Stockholders 
Equity Requirement or if we do later regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or the Stockholders Equity
Requirement, that we will be able to continue to comply with all applicable Nasdaq listing requirements now or in the future.
If we are unable to maintain compliance with these Nasdaq requirements, our Common Stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital
Market. 

In
the event that our Common Stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, as a result of our failure to comply with the Minimum
Bid Price Requirement or the Stockholders Equity Requirement, or due to our failure to continue to comply with any other
requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and is not eligible for listing on another exchange, trading in
the shares of our Common Stock could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established
for unlisted securities such as the Pink Market or another over-the-counter market operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. In such
event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our Common Stock, and it would likely
be more difficult to obtain coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our Common Stock
to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a national exchange.
