patients with implanted cardiac devices or rare cardiovascular conditions. The prevailing treatment for thrombosis is an oral anticoagulant,
either a VKA, like warfarin, or a direct oral anticoagulant, DOAC ). VKAs block the production of vitamin K-dependent blood
clotting factors, such that the blood is thinned, preventing clots, while DOACs directly block the activity of certain of
these clotting factors. Tecarfarin, like warfarin, is a VKA. 

Tecarfarin, a once-daily oral and reversible anticoagulation
treatment, is expected to improve outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs for patients that are not well served by currently available
VKAs and for which DOACs are contraindicated or lack clinical evidence of efficacy. This includes patients with LVADs, patients with ESKD
and AFib, and patients with mechanical heart valves, among others, where the need for VKA-dependent chronic anticoagulation has been underscored
by recent clinical studies. 

Tecarfarin is specifically designed to provide
safer and more effective anticoagulation than the most commonly prescribed VKA, warfarin. 

We anticipate that tecarfarin will address many
of the bleeding and other adverse events and drug-to-drug interaction challenges of warfarin because tecarfarin is metabolized using a
different metabolic pathway. 

Extensive data indicates that tecarfarin may avoid
kidney impairment problems, which are common in these patients. Late-stage clinical trials show that tecarfarin may offer enhanced stability
and time in therapeutic range (TTR) that inversely correlates with major events. Cadrenal aims to show that tecarfarin will provide less
dosing variability, enhancing the quality of care for patients and reducing the time-consuming and costly hassles of dosing adjustments
for healthcare providers. We believe tecarfarin is the only new anticoagulant being developed for patients with implanted cardiac devices
and certain other rare cardiovascular conditions. Despite breakthrough implanted cardiac device products by leading medical device companies
such as Abbott, patients still depend on 70-year-old warfarin for the indefinite future. 

Tecarfarin has an orphan drug designation from
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA for the prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism (blood clots) in patients
with an implanted mechanical circulatory support device, which includes left ventricular assist device (LVAD), a heart pump. Tecarfarin
also has orphan drug and fast-track designations from the FDA for the prevention of systemic thromboembolism of cardiac origin in patients
with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). 

16 

Tecarfarin has been evaluated in eleven (11) human
clinical trials in over 1,000 individuals; (269 patients were treated for at least six months and 129 patients were treated for one year
or more). In Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 2/3 clinical trials, tecarfarin has generally been well-tolerated in both healthy adult subjects
and patients with chronic kidney disease CKD ). In the Phase 2/3 trial, EMBRACE-AC, the largest tecarfarin trial with 607
patients having completed it including those with mechanical heart valves, only 1.6 of the blinded tecarfarin subjects suffered from
major bleeding and there were no thrombotic events. 

Tecarfarin was developed by researchers using
a small molecule retrometabolic drug design process which targets a different metabolic pathway than the most commonly prescribed
drugs for the treatment of thrombosis and AFib. Drug metabolism refers to the process by which a drug is inactivated by
the body and rendered easier to eliminate or to be cleared by the body. Most approved drugs, including warfarin, the only FDA-approved
VKA, which is a prescribed drug for the treatment of thrombosis, are metabolized in the liver through a pathway known as the Cytochrome
CYP450 system, or CYP450, by the enzymes known as CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. 

By using a different metabolic pathway, tecarfarin
eliminates or minimizes the CYP450 metabolism in the liver. Patients taking multiple medications that interact with CYP2C9, or CYP3A4,
or those with impaired kidney function, can experience an overload in the pathway, creating a bottleneck that often leads to insufficient
clearance, which results in a toxic build-up of one or more drugs. In some instances, patients taking multiple medications metabolized
by the same CYP450 pathway may experience decreased efficacy of one or more of the medications due to rapid metabolism or increased drug
effect and/or toxicity due to enzyme induction. Patient-specific genetic differences can also hinder drug clearance in the CYP450 pathway.
Our product candidate tecarfarin was designed to follow a metabolic pathway distinct from the CYP450 pathway and is metabolized by both
CYP450 and non-CYP450 pathways. We believe this may allow elimination by large capacity and non-saturable tissue esterase pathways that
exist throughout the body rather than just in the liver. 

There are approximately 15,000 patients
in the U.S. with LVADs, and recent randomized controlled trials in LVAD patients have documented that currently available VKAs yield poor
quality anticoagulation despite the tight management of anticoagulation in the clinical trial setting. Implantable LVAD therapy is
used to improve quality of life, alleviate symptoms, and extend survival rates in patients with advanced heart failure, irrespective
of eligibility for cardiac transplant. Patients with LVADs require chronic anticoagulation to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications,
and under the currently available anticoagulants, they commonly experience bleeding events. Recent data reveals that the current
standard of care anticoagulant, warfarin, yields suboptimal levels of anticoagulation, leading to excess bleeding complications. LVAD
patients require life-long anticoagulant therapy to reduce the risk of pump thrombosis and anticoagulation management in patients with
LVADs continues to be a challenge. Patients and their clinicians are faced with the daily challenge of balancing the need for adequate
anticoagulation versus the bleeding risks that are associated with excess anticoagulation. Warfarin is the only available oral anticoagulant
for all currently available LVAD devices, however, warfarin is known to be a difficult medication to manage due to its labile metabolism,
and its many drug-drug interactions which also impacts the stability of anticoagulation. 

In
patients with LVADs, recent data also highlights the need for a next generation VKA anticoagulant. The ARIES-HM3 study was designed to
evaluate the need for chronic aspirin treatment in patients with the newest LVAD, the HeartMate3. The use of aspirin in LVAD patients
was standard but had never been proven to be beneficial. The ARIES study randomized LVAD patients to continue aspirin, along with warfarin,
versus warfarin alone. The main finding of the study revealed that aspirin is not helpful in LVAD patients; however, since all patients
were receiving warfarin and had careful monitoring of the quality of anticoagulation, the study also provided the opportunity to determine
if the quality of anticoagulation provided by warfarin, had an impact on patient outcomes. The analysis of this carefully controlled and
monitored study showed that the average time in the therapeutic range was only 56 with warfarin, far below the target of 70 , and that,
despite the superior design of the HM3 device, poor quality anticoagulation was associated with excess thrombotic and bleeding events.

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses were 1,674,905 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 898,051 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The 776,854, or 87 , increase can be primarily attributed to a 192,948 increase in personnel-related expenses
as a result of the hiring of a Chief Operating Officer in February 2024 as well as annual pay raises for management in January 2024, a
 422,147 increase in public company expenses, a 141,304 increase in stock-based compensation, and a 77,456 increase in professional
fees and other expenses. These increases were partially offset by a 45,535 decrease in consulting expenses. 

Research and development expenses 

Research and development expenses were 784,646
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 243,948 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 540,698, or 222 ,
increase can be primarily attributed to a 291,155 increase in expenses associated with chemistry, manufacturing and controls CMC ),
a 213,078 increase in consulting fees, and a 19,102 increase in personnel-related expenses. 

Interest and dividend income 

Interest and dividend income was 52,129 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024. This represents the interest and dividend income earned from our investments in money market funds
from the proceeds of our IPO and July 2023 Private Placement. Interest and dividend income was 106,145 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease in interest and dividend income in the current quarter can be attributed to lower balances in money market funds.

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses were 4,013,336
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,647,407 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 1,365,929, or 52 ,
increase can be primarily attributed to a 588,693 increase in personnel-related expenses as we hired a Chief Operating Officer in February
2024 as well as annual pay raises for management in January 2024, a 636,669 increase in public company expenses, and a 61,139 increase
in professional fees. These increases were partially offset by a 93,788 decrease in consulting expenses. 

Research and development expenses 

Research and development expenses were 2,667,382
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3,720,222 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The prior period included
a 3.0 million expense for the issuance of 40,000 shares of common stock (valued at 3.0 million) in January 2023 to HESP LLC, pursuant
to the terms of an Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement. This 3.0 million decrease was partially offset by a 1,094,419 increase
in expenses associated with chemistry, manufacturing and controls CMC ), a 666,033 increase in consulting fees, a 105,073
increase in personnel-related expenses, and a 69,120 increase in professional fees. 

Change in fair value of derivative liabilities 

Concurrent with the closing of the IPO in January
2023, the note holders converted the debt into common stock, accordingly, the derivative financial liabilities were de-recognized and
reclassified to stockholders equity (deficit) on January 24, 2023. 

The derivative liabilities were considered a level
3 fair value financial instrument and were remeasured up to January 24, 2023 which was the date of derecognition. We recorded a non-cash
charge of 216,095 in January 2023. This charge represented the increase in the fair value of the derivative liabilities since the previous
measurement date of December 31, 2022. We did not have such activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Loss on extinguishment of debt 

We recorded a 740,139 loss on the extinguishment
of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This loss represented the unamortized debt discount associated with the convertible
notes and the November promissory notes, which were settled concurrent with the IPO. We did not have such activity during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. 

19 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since inception, we have incurred losses and
negative cash flows from operations. To date, we have funded our operations from the proceeds of the sale of convertible notes, and
the nonconvertible notes and warrants issued in November 2022, as well as our IPO completed in January 2023, our Private Placement
consummated in July 2023, and the sale of common stock through our ATM facility. We had a net loss of 6,464,099 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 which included 656,987 of non-cash expenses. Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 totaled 5,566,844. As of November 7, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 11.3 million,
which is expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of the filing of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, however, we will require additional funding to complete our planned Phase 3 clinical trial and submit
our New Drug Application.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
cash used in operating activities was 5,566,844. Net loss adjusted for the non-cash items as detailed on the statement of cash flows,
used 5,807,112 in cash, and the changes in operating assets and liabilities, as detailed on the statement of cash flows, provided 240,268
in cash primarily from a 329,504 increase in accounts payable partially offset by a 116,884 increase in deferred offering costs, and
a 102,033 increase in prepaid expenses. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
cash used in operating activities was 2,835,878. Net loss adjusted for the non-cash items as detailed on the statement of cash flows,
used 2,634,308 in cash, and the changes in operating assets and liabilities, as detailed on the statement of cash flows, used 201,570
in cash primarily from a decrease in accrued liabilities of 466,935 and a decrease in accounts payable of 263,239, partially offset
by a 672,295 decrease in deferred equity offering costs. 

Financing activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
net cash provided by financing activities totaled 1,528,244. During the period, we utilized our ATM facility, which generated proceeds
of 1,527,946, net of fees. In addition, we had proceeds of 298 from the exercise of Pre-Funded Warrants. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
net cash provided by financing activities totaled 11,915,991 as we completed our IPO in January 2023, generating net proceeds of
 5,408,575, and we completed a private placement financing in July 2023, generating net proceeds of 6,507,416. We also received 250,000
from the exercise of warrants that we issued in November 2022, which proceeds were used to repay the notes that were issued in November,
with accrued interest on the notes being paid in cash.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

This discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and
assumptions made in the accompanying financial statements include but are not limited to the fair value of financial instruments, the
fair value of stock-based awards, deferred tax assets and valuation allowance, income tax uncertainties, and certain accruals. Our estimates
are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimated under different assumption or conditions. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

We evaluate all of our agreements to determine
if such instruments have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. We account for certain redemption features
that are associated with convertible notes as liabilities at fair value and adjust the instruments to their fair value at the end of each
reporting period. Derivative financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in
the fair value recognized in other income (expense) in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss for each reporting
period while such instruments are outstanding. The embedded derivative liability is valued using a probability-weighted expected return
model. If we repay the note holders or if, during the next round of financing, the note holders convert the debt into equity, the derivative
financial liability will be de-recognized on that date. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current
or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the
balance sheet date. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

We measure our stock-based awards granted to employees,
consultants and directors based on the estimated fair values of the awards and recognize the compensation over the requisite service period.
We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock option awards. Stock-based compensation is recognized
using the straight-line method. As the stock compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it is reduced by forfeitures.
We account for forfeitures as they occur. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We did not have during the period presented, and
we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the SEC rules. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September
30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act,
means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is
collected, recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. Our disclosure controls
and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30,
2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such a date, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) of the Exchange Act) that
occurred that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

21 

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We are not currently subject to any material legal
proceedings. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Investing in our securities involves a high
degree of risk. Please refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, contained in our Annual Report for a description of certain
significant risks and uncertainties to which our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject. Except as set forth
below, there have been no material changes from these risk factors as of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

We cannot be assured
that we will be able to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

Our securities are listed
on The Nasdaq Capital Market, a national securities exchange. We cannot be assured that we will continue to comply with the rules, regulations
or requirements governing the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq Capital Market or that our securities will continue to be listed on
Nasdaq Capital Market in the future. If Nasdaq should determine at any time that we fail to meet Nasdaq requirements, we may be subject
to a delisting action by Nasdaq. 

On September 6, 2023,
we received a letter from Nasdaq stating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Rule ),
requiring listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share because our closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive
business days was below 1.00 per share. Pursuant to the Rule, we initially had 180 calendar days (until March 4, 2024), to regain compliance
with the Nasdaq Listing Rules (the Compliance Period ). On February 16, 2024, we requested an additional 180 calendar days
to comply with the Rule. On March 5, 2024, we received written notification from Nasdaq granting our request for a 180-day extension or
until September 3, 2024 to regain compliance with the Rule. On August 20, 2024, we effected a 1-for-15 reverse stock split. On September
5, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq stating that we had regained compliance with the Rule. However, there can be no assurance that
we will continue to comply with the Rule or any other Nasdaq continued listing requirements. 

If Nasdaq delists our
securities from trading on its exchange at some future date, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; 

a determination that our common stock is a penny stock 
which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading
activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company;
and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain
additional financing in the future. 

We will also need to raise additional capital
to meet our long-term business objectives. 

We had an accumulated deficit of 21,535,514 as of September 30, 2024 and a net loss of approximately 6,464,099 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, having incurred significant losses from operations to date. We expect to incur significant expenses and continued
losses from operations for the foreseeable future. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our
anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months, however, we will require additional financing as we continue to execute our
business strategy, including additional funds for the initiation of enrollment of patients and completion of the planned pivotal Phase
3 trial for tecarfarin. Our unaudited financial statement for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were prepared under the assumption
that we will continue as a going concern; however, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with the initiation of enrollment
of patients and completion of the planned pivotal Phase 3 trial for tecarfarin. Our liquidity may be negatively impacted as a result of
research and development cost increases in addition to general economic and industry factors. In order to meet our expected obligations,
we intend to raise additional funds through partnering and equity and debt financings or a combination of these potential sources of liquidity.
There can be no assurance that funding will be available on acceptable terms on a timely basis, or at all. The various ways that we could
raise capital carry potential risks. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity securities, which
will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impact our
ability to conduct our business. If we raise funds through partnering such as collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required
to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we do not succeed in
raising additional funds on acceptable terms or at all, we may be unable to complete the planned Phase 3 trial. 

22 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds. 

(a) Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 

We did not sell any equity securities during the
