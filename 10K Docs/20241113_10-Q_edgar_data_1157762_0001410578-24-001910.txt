 of their after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to their general reserves until the cumulative amount reaches of their paid-in capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends, or as loans or advances. These foreign-invested enterprises may also allocate a portion of their after-tax profits, at the discretion of their boards of directors, to their staff welfare and bonus funds. Any amounts so allocated may not be distributed and, accordingly, would not be available for distribution to Genesis and HLUSA. The PRC government also imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currencies out of China. The China-based Subsidiaries may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currencies. If China Automotive is unable to receive dividend payments from its subsidiaries, including the China-based subsidiaries, China Automotive may be unable to effectively finance its operations or pay dividends on its shares. Transactions other than those that fall under the current account and that involve conversion of RMB into foreign currency are classified as capital account transactions; examples of capital account transactions include repatriations of investment by or loans to foreign owners, or direct equity investments in a foreign entity by a China domiciled entity. Capital account transactions require prior approval from China s State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, or its provincial branch to convert a remittance into a foreign currency, such as U.S. Dollars, and transmit the foreign currency outside of China. This system could be changed at any time and any such change may affect the ability of the Company or its subsidiaries in China to repatriate capital or profits, if any, outside China. Furthermore, SAFE has a significant degree of administrative discretion in implementing the laws and has used this discretion to limit convertibility of current account payments out of China. Whether as a result of a deterioration in the Chinese balance of payments, a shift in the Chinese macroeconomic prospects or any number of other reasons, China could impose additional restrictions on capital remittances abroad. As a result of these and other restrictions under the laws and regulations of the People s Republic of China, or the PRC, the Company s China subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the parent. The Company has no assurance that the relevant Chinese governmental authorities in the future will not limit further or eliminate the ability of the Company s China-based subsidiaries to purchase foreign currencies and transfer such funds to the Company to meet its liquidity or other business needs. Any inability to access funds in China, if and when needed for use by the Company outside of China, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company s liquidity and its business.

 Critical Accounting Estimates The Company prepares its condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of different assumptions or conditions. The following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: It requires the Company to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time it was making the estimate, and Changes in the estimate or different estimates that the Company could have selected would have had a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. 
 The table below presents information about the nature and rationale for the Company s critical accounting estimates: Balance Sheet Caption Critical Estimate Item Nature of Estimates Required Assumptions/Approaches Used Key Factors Accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities Warranty obligations Estimating warranty requires the Company to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold. OEMs are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties, which may impact the Company s exposure to these costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources and Use of Cash The Company has historically financed its liquidity requirements from a variety of sources, including short-term borrowings under bank credit agreements, bankers acceptances, issuances of capital stock and notes and internally generated cash. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 111.8 million, compared to 125.7 million as of December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of 13.9 million, or 11.1 .

Except for the expected distribution of dividends from the Company s PRC subsidiaries to the Company in order to fund the payment of the one-time transition tax due to the U.S. Tax Reform and the special cash dividend in August 2024, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the funds in subsidiaries established in the PRC. Based on our liquidity assessment, we believe that our cash flow from operations and proceeds from our financing activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures, for the foreseeable future and for at least twelve months subsequent to the filing of this report. Common share dividends On July 19, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of 0.8 per common share (See Note 13). The aggregate amount of the special dividend payment was 24.1 million. 9.3 million of the dividend has been paid in August 2024 and the remaining 14.8 million will be paid before December 31, 2024. Capital Source The Company s capital source is multifaceted, such as bank loans and banks acceptance facilities. In financing activities and operating activities, the Company s banks require the Company to sign line of credit agreements and repay such facilities within one to two years. On the condition that the Company can provide adequate mortgage security and has not violated the terms of the line of credit agreement, such facilities can be extended for another one to two years. The Company had short-term loans of 59.7 million, long-term loans of 0.2 million and bankers acceptances of 97.5 million (See Note 8) as of September 30, 2024. The Company currently expects to be able to obtain similar bank loans, i.e., RMB loans, and bankers acceptance facilities in the future if it can provide adequate mortgage security following the termination of the above-mentioned agreements, see the table under Bank Arrangements below for more information. If the Company is not able to do so, it will have to refinance such debt as it becomes due

 or repay that debt to the extent it has cash available from operations or from the proceeds of additional issuances of capital stock. Due to a depreciation of assets, the value of the mortgages securing the above-mentioned bank loans and banker s acceptances is expected to be reduced by approximately 16.3 million over the next 12 months. If the Company wishes to maintain the same amount of bank loans and banker s acceptances in the future, it may be required by the banks to provide additional mortgages of 8.4 million as of the maturity date of such line of credit agreements, see the table under Bank Arrangements below for more information. The Company can still obtain a reduced line of credit with a reduction of 8.4 million, which is 51.7 , the mortgage ratio, of 16.3 million, if it cannot provide additional mortgages. The Company expects that the reduction in bank loans will not have a material adverse effect on its liquidity.

 The Company must use notes payable for the purpose described in the table. If it fails to do so, the banks will no longer issue the notes payable, and it may have an adverse effect on the Company s liquidity and capital resources. The Company has to deposit a sufficient amount of cash on the due date of notes payable for payment to the suppliers. If the bank has advanced payment for the Company, it will be charged an additional 50 penalty interest. The Company complied with such financial covenants as of September 30, 2024.

(b) Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 51.3 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of 25.6 million for the same period of 2023, representing an increase in net cash outflows by 25.7 million, which was mainly due to the net effect of (1) a decrease in cash inflows from proceeds from maturities of short-term investments by 22.9 million, (2) an increase in cash outflows from payments to acquire property plant and equipment of 6.1 million, (3) the decrease in cash outflows from investment under the equity method by 5.4 million, and (4) an increase in cash outflows from purchase of short-term investments by 3.2 million. (c) Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 16.3 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 5.3 million for the same period of 2023, representing an increase in net cash inflows by 21.6 million, which was mainly due to the net effect of (1) the increase in cash inflows from proceeds from bank loan by 21.6 million, (2) the increase in cash received from capital contributions by 15.5 million, (3) the increase in cash outflows from dividends paid to the common stock by 9.3 million, and (4) an increase in cash outflows from repayment of bank loan by 6.2 million.

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy We recognize the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. Managing Material Risks Integrated Overall Risk Management We have strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework to promote a company-wide culture of cybersecurity risk management. This integration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making processes at every level. Our management team continuously evaluates and addresses cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business objectives and operational needs. Oversee Third-party Risk Because we are aware of the risks associated with third-party service providers, we have implemented stringent processes to oversee and manage these risks. We conduct thorough security assessments of all third-party providers before engagement and maintain ongoing

 monitoring to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards. This approach is designed to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents originating from third-parties. Risks from Cybersecurity Threats We have not encountered cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. There were no material changes to the disclosure made in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 regarding this matter. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. A. Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, Messrs. Wu Qizhou and Li Jie, respectively, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Report. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports, such as this Form 10-Q, that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, Messrs. Wu and Li concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of its disclosure control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. B. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
