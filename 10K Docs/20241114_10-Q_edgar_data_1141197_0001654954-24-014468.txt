Summary of The Information Contained in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Our MD A is organized as follows: General Overview . Discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights affecting us, to provide context for the remainder of our MD A. Strategy . Discussion of our strategy moving forward and how we plan to seek to increase stockholder value. Results of Operations and Financial Condition . An analysis of our financial results comparing the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, and a discussion of changes in our consolidated balance sheets, cash flows and a discussion of our financial condition. Critical Accounting Estimates . Accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results and forecasts. General Overview We are an oil and gas company focused on the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas assets where the latest in modern drilling and completion techniques and technologies have yet to be applied. In particular, we focus on legacy proven properties where there is a long production history, well defined geology and existing infrastructure that can be leveraged when applying modern field management technologies. Our current properties are located in the San Andres formation of the Permian Basin situated in West Texas and eastern New Mexico (the Permian Basin and in the Denver-Julesberg Basin D-J Basin in Colorado and Wyoming. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 14,552 net Permian Basin acres located in Chaves and Roosevelt Counties, New Mexico, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Energy Development Corp. PEDCO ), and which are operated by our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Ridgeway Arizona Oil Corp. RAZO ), which asset we refer to as our Permian Basin Asset . Also as of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 19,453 net D-J Basin acres located in Weld and Morgan Counties, Colorado, and Laramie County, Wyoming, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, PRH Holdings LLC PRH ), and which are operated by our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Red Hawk Petroleum, LLC Red Hawk ), which asset we refer to as our D-J Basin Asset . As of September 30, 2024, we held interests in 300 gross and 298.5 net wells in our Permian Basin Asset, of which 28 are active producers, two are active injectors and two are active salt water disposal wells, all of which are held by PEDCO and operated by RAZO, and interests in 120 gross (27.8 net) wells in our D-J Basin Asset held by PRH, all of which 18 gross (16.2 net) wells are operated by Red Hawk and currently producing, 85 gross (11.6 net) wells are non-operated, and 17 wells have an after-payout interest. 16 Table of Contents Strategy We believe that horizontal development and exploitation of conventional assets in the Permian Basin and development of the Wattenberg and Wattenberg Extension in the D-J Basin, represent among the most economic oil and natural gas plays in the U.S. We plan to optimize our existing assets and opportunistically seek additional acreage proximate to our currently held core acreage, as well as other attractive onshore U.S. oil and gas assets that fit our acquisition criteria, that Company management believes can be developed using our technical and operating expertise and be accretive to stockholder value. Specifically, we seek to increase stockholder value through the following strategies: Grow production, cash flow and reserves by developing our operated drilling inventory and participating opportunistically in non-operated projects. We believe our extensive inventory of drilling locations in the Permian Basin and the D-J Basin, combined with our operating expertise, will enable us to continue to deliver accretive production, cash flow and reserves growth. We believe the location, concentration and scale of our core leasehold positions, coupled with our technical understanding of the reservoirs will allow us to efficiently develop our core areas and to allocate capital to maximize the value of our resource base. Apply modern drilling and completion techniques and technologies. We own and intend to acquire additional properties that have been historically underdeveloped and underexploited. We believe our attention to detail and application of the latest industry advances in horizontal drilling, completions design, frac intensity and locally optimal frac fluids will allow us to successfully develop our properties. Optimization of well density and configuration. We own properties that are legacy oil fields characterized by widespread vertical and horizontal development and geological well control. We utilize the extensive geological, petrophysical and production data of such legacy properties to confirm optimal well spacing and configuration using modern reservoir evaluation methodologies. Maintain a high degree of operational control. We believe that by retaining high operational control, we can efficiently manage the timing and amount of our capital expenditures and operating costs, and thus key in on the optimal drilling and completions strategies, which we believe will generate higher recoveries and greater rates of return per well. Leverage extensive deal flow, technical and operational experience to evaluate and execute accretive acquisition opportunities. Our management and technical teams have an extensive track record of forming and building oil and gas businesses. We also have significant expertise in successfully sourcing, evaluating and executing acquisition opportunities. We believe our understanding of the geology, geophysics and reservoir properties of potential acquisition targets will allow us to identify and acquire highly prospective acreage in order to grow our reserve base and maximize stockholder value. Preserve financial flexibility to pursue organic and external growth opportunities. We intend to maintain a disciplined financial profile in order to provide flexibility across various commodity and market cycles. We also are committed to developing and monitoring environmental, social and governance ESG initiatives and the Board of Directors plans to evaluate the potential adoption of such initiatives from time to time, provided that no definitive ESG plans have been adopted to date. 17 Table of Contents Our strategy is to be the operator and/or a significant working interest owner, directly or through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, in the majority of our properties and acreage so we can dictate the pace of development in order to execute our business plan. Our revised net capital expenditures for 2024 are estimated to range between 21 million to 23 million. This estimate includes a range of 19 million to 22 million for drilling and completion costs on our Permian Basin and D-J Basin Assets (of which we have incurred approximately 16.4 million through September 30, 2024) and approximately 1.5 million in estimated capital expenditures for electric submersible pump (ESP) purchases, rod pump conversions, recompletions, well cleanouts, leasing, facilities, remediation and other miscellaneous capital expenses (of which we have incurred approximately 1.2 million through September 30, 2024) . This estimate does not include expenditures for acquisitions or other projects that may arise but are not currently anticipated. We periodically review our capital expenditures and adjust our capital forecasts and allocations based on liquidity, drilling results, leasehold acquisition opportunities, partner non-consents, proposals from third party operators, and commodity prices, while prioritizing our financial strength and liquidity. Our revised 2024 capital expenditure estimate does not include expenditures for unanticipated expenses that may arise, including for opportunistic leasehold acquisitions and other extraordinary projects for which we have not budgeted (for which we have paid approximately 0.5 million for opportunistic leasing acquisitions through September 30, 2024). We periodically review our capital expenditures and adjust our capital forecasts and allocations based on liquidity, drilling results, leasehold acquisition opportunities, partner non-consents, proposals from third party operators, and commodity prices, while prioritizing our financial strength and liquidity. We plan to continue to evaluate D-J Basin well proposals as received from third party operators and participate in those we deem most economic and prospective. If new proposals are received that meet our economic thresholds and require material capital expenditures, we have flexibility to move capital from our Permian Asset to our D-J Basin Asset, or vice versa, as our Permian Asset is approximately 100 operated and held by production HBP ), allowing for flexibility of timing on development. Our 2024 development program is based upon our current outlook for the year and is subject to revision, if and as necessary, to react to market conditions, product pricing, contractor availability, requisite permitting, capital availability, partner non-consents, capital allocation changes between assets, acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments determined by the Company in the best interest of its shareholders while prioritizing our financial strength and liquidity. On September 11, 2024, we successfully closed a new 250 million reserve-based lending facility RBL or Facility with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders (including Citibank, N.A.) from time to time party thereto. The Facility has a maturity of four years and provides for an initial borrowing base of 20.0 million and an aggregate maximum revolving credit amount of 250 million. The Company has not drawn down any borrowings under the Facility as of the date of this Report. We expect that we will have sufficient cash available to meet our needs over the next 12 months after the filing of this Report and in the foreseeable future, including to fund the remainder of our 2024 development program, discussed above, which cash we anticipate being available from (i) projected cash flow from our operations, (ii) existing cash on hand, (iii) funding available through our RBL, and (iv) equity infusions or loans (which may be convertible) made available from Dr. Simon G. Kukes, our Chief Executive Officer and director, which funding Dr. Kukes is under no obligation to provide, and/or other qualified investors. In addition, we may seek additional funding through asset sales and farm-out arrangements to fund potential acquisitions during the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. How We Conduct Our Business and Evaluate Our Operations Our use of capital for acquisitions and development allows us to direct our capital resources to what we believe to be the most attractive opportunities as market conditions evolve. We have historically acquired properties that we believe had significant appreciation potential. We intend to continue to acquire both operated and non-operated properties to the extent we believe they meet our return objectives. We will use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the performance of our oil and natural gas operations, including: production volumes; realized prices on the sale of oil and natural gas, including the effects of our commodity derivative contracts; oil and natural gas production and operating expenses; capital expenditures; general and administrative expenses; net cash provided by operating activities; and net income. 18 Table of Contents Results of Operations and Financial Condition Market Conditions and Commodity Prices Our financial results depend on many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by among other factors, weather conditions, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and, therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our production volumes or revenues. In addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success. We expect prices to remain volatile for the remainder of the year. For information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues, refer to Results of Operations below. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The majority of the numbers presented below are rounded numbers and should be considered as approximate. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 We reported net income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, of 2.9 million, or 0.03 per common share, compared to net income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 of 0.9 million or 0.01 per share. The increase in net income of 2.0 million when comparing the current period to the prior year s period was primarily due to a 1.7 million increase in revenues coupled with a 0.7 million gain on sale of oil and gas properties, offset by a 0.4 million increase in total operating expenses (each discussed in more detail below). Net Revenues The following table sets forth the operating results and production data for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended September 30, Increase Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (Decrease) Sale Volumes: Crude Oil (Bbls) 108,810 88,755 20,055 23 Natural Gas (Mcf) 142,669 144,495 (1,826 (1 NGL (Bbls) 23,508 13,724 9,784 71 Total (Boe) (1) 156,096 126,562 29,534 23 Crude Oil (Bbls per day) 1,183 965 218 23 Natural Gas (Mcf per day) 1,551 1,571 (20 (1 NGL (Bbls per day) 256 149 107 72 Total (Boe per day) (1) 1,698 1,376 322 23 Average Sale Price: Crude Oil /Bbl) 75.82 75.54 0.28 - Natural Gas /Mcf) 1.23 2.29 (1.06 (46 NGL /Bbl) 26.53 21.46 5.07 24 Net Operating Revenues (in thousands): Crude Oil 8,250 6,705 1,545 23 Natural Gas 176 330 (154 (47 NGL 624 295 329 112 Total Revenues 9,050 7,330 1,720 23 (1) Assumes 6 Mcf of natural gas equivalents to 1 barrel of oil. 19 Table of Contents Total crude oil, natural gas and NGL revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, increased 1.7 million, or 23 , to 9.0 million, compared to 7.3 million for the same period a year ago, due to a favorable volume variance of 1.7 million. There was a negligible price variance over the periods. The increase in overall production volume is related to our participation in 13 new non-operated wells in the D-J Basin and the drilling and completion of three operated wells with a third-party in the Permian Basin both in the latter part of Q1 2024. We also recognized additional production from our participating in another six wells in the D-J Basin which production began in latter part of Q3 2024. Operating Expenses and Other Income The following table summarizes our production costs and operating expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Increase Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (Decrease) Direct Lease Operating Expenses 1,603 1,106 497 45 Workovers 124 373 (249 (67 Gain on ARO Settlement - (11 11 100 Other 829 777 52 7 Total Lease Operating Expenses 2,556 2,245 311 14 Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion 3,055 2,932 123 4 General and Administrative (Cash) 879 786 93 12 Share-Based Compensation (Non-Cash) 464 511 (47 (9 Total General and Administrative Expense 1,343 1,297 46 4 Gain on Sale of Oil and Gas Properties 735 - 735 100 Interest Income 84 88 (4 (5 Other Income - 5 (5 (100 Includes severance, ad valorem taxes, workover adjustments and assessment and marketing costs. Lease Operating Expenses .The increase of 0.3 million was primarily due to higher direct and variable lease operating expenses associated with the higher oil volume resulting from the increased number of wells and increased oil production during the current year s period, compared to the prior year s period, due to our participation in new wells in the D-J Basin, as well as production from our recently completed wells. Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion. The 0.1 million increase was primarily the result of higher crude oil and NGL volumes resulting from the increased number of wells and increased oil production from our new wells, compared to the prior year s period. 20 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses (excluding share-based compensation). The 0.1 million increase was primarily the result of additional payroll and software licensing fees. Share-Based Compensation. Share-based compensation, which is included in general and administrative expenses in the Statements of Operations, decreased nominally due to the forfeiture of certain employee stock-based options due to certain voluntary employee terminations. Share-based compensation is utilized for the purpose of conserving cash resources for use in field development activities and operations. Gain on Sale of Oil and Gas Properties . The Company sold leasehold rights to 320 net acres located in the D-J Basin for net cash proceeds of 0.7 million and recognized a gain on sale of oil and gas properties of 0.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We had no sales of oil and gas properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest Income. Includes interest earned from our interest-bearing cash accounts, for which interest rates have remained relatively flat in the current period, compared to the prior period and interest on our note receivable. There was no other income in the current period compared to a nominal amount in the prior period. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 We reported net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 of 6.4 million, or 0.07 per share, compared to net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 of 4.3 million or 0.05 per share. The increase in net income of 2.1 million when comparing the current period to the prior year s period was primarily due to a 4.9 million increase in revenues coupled with a 0.7 million gain on sale of oil and gas properties, offset by a 3.5 million increase in total operating expenses (each discussed in more detail below). Net Revenues The following table sets forth the operating results and production data for the periods indicated: Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (Decrease) Sale Volumes: Crude Oil (Bbls) 349,185 304,487 44,698 15 Natural Gas (Mcf) 420,182 353,179 67,003 19 NGL (Bbls) 54,148 42,737 11,411 27 Total (Boe) (1) 473,363 406,087 67,276 17 Crude Oil (Bbls per day) 1,274 1,115 159 14 Natural Gas (Mcf per day) 1,534 1,294 240 19 NGL (Bbls per day) 198 157 41 26 Total (Boe per day) (1) 1,728 1,488 240 16 Average Sale Price: Crude Oil /Bbl) 76.34 72.18 4.16 6 Natural Gas /Mcf) 1.90 3.11 (1.21 (39 NGL /Bbl) 28.11 22.60 5.51 24 Net Operating Revenues (in thousands): Crude Oil 26,656 21,977 4,679 21 Natural Gas 799 1,099 (300 (27 NGL 1,522 966 556 58 Total Revenues 28,977 24,042 4,935 21 (1) Assumes 6 Mcf of natural gas equivalents to 1 barrel of oil. 21 Table of Contents Total crude oil, natural gas and NGL revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, increased 4.9 million, or 21 , to 29.0 million, compared to 24.1 million for the same period a year ago, due to a favorable price variance of 1.1 million, coupled with a favorable volume variance of 3.8 million. The increase in production volume is related to our participation in 13 new non-operated wells in the D-J Basin and the drilling and completion of three operated wells with a third-party in the Permian Basin, both in the latter part of Q1 2024. The increase in production volume is related to our participation in 13 new non-operated wells in the D-J Basin and the drilling and completion of three operated wells with a third-party in the Permian Basin both in the latter part of Q1 2024. We also recognized additional production from our participation in another six wells in the D-J Basin which production began in the latter part of Q2 2024.

Lease Operating Expenses . The increase of 1.1 million was primarily due to higher direct and variable lease operating expenses associated with the higher oil volume resulting from the increased number of wells and increased oil production during the current year s period, compared to the prior year s period, due to our participation in new wells in the D-J Basin, as well as production from our recently completed wells. Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion. The 2.4 million increase was primarily the result of higher crude oil, natural gas and NGL volumes resulting from the increased number of wells and increased oil production from our new wells, compared to the prior year s period. 22 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses (excluding share-based compensation). The 0.2 million increase was primarily the result of additional payroll and software licensing fees. Share-Based Compensation. Share-based compensation, which is included in general and administrative expenses in the Statements of Operations, decreased nominally due to the forfeiture of certain employee stock-based options due to certain voluntary employee terminations. Share-based compensation is utilized for the purpose of conserving cash resources for use in field development activities and operations. Gain on Sale of Oil and Gas Properties . The Company sold leasehold rights to 320 net acres located in the D-J Basin for net cash proceeds of 0.7 million and recognized a gain on sale of oil and gas properties of 0.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We had no sales of oil and gas properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gain on Sale of Fixed Asset. Relates to the sale of a vehicle and the subsequent purchase of another vehicle in the current period. Interest Income and Other (Expense) Income . Includes interest earned from our interest-bearing cash accounts, for which interest rates have remained relatively flat in the current period, compared to the prior period, and interest on our note receivable. Other expense in the current period primarily relates to the subsequent disposition of a cash escrow bank balance related to the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary EOR Operating Company. Other income in the prior period is primarily related to the sale of used pipe. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary sources of cash for the Company during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, were from 29.0 million in sales of crude oil and natural gas and 0.8 million from a sale of oil and gas properties. The primary uses of cash were funds used for drilling, completion and operating costs. Working Capital At September 30, 2024, the Company s total current assets of 11.0 million exceeded its total current liabilities of 5.2 million, resulting in a working capital surplus of 5.8 million, while at December 31, 2023, the Company s total current assets of 24.6 million exceeded its total current liabilities of 18.9 million, resulting in a working capital surplus of 5.7 million. The 0.1 million increase in our working capital surplus is primarily related to an increase in oil and gas receivables from production sales, offset by cash used to reduce payables related to our current capital drilling program (described above). Financing On September 11, 2024, we entered into a new 250 million reserve-based lending facility (the RBL or Facility with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders (including Citibank, N.A.) from time to time a party thereto. The Facility has a maturity of four years and provides for an initial borrowing base of 20.0 million and an aggregate maximum revolving credit amount of 250 million. The Company has not drawn down any borrowings under the Facility as of the date of this Report. We expect that we will have sufficient cash available to meet our needs over the next 12 months after the filing of this Report and in the foreseeable future, including to fund the remainder of our 2024 development program, discussed above, which cash we anticipate being available from (i) projected cash flow from our operations, (ii) existing cash on hand, (iii) funding available through our RBL, and (iv) equity infusions or loans (which may be convertible) made available from Dr. Simon G. Kukes, our Chief Executive Officer and director, which funding Dr. Kukes is under no obligation to provide, and/or other qualified investors. In addition, we may seek additional funding through asset sales and farm-out arrangements to fund potential acquisitions during the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. 23 Table of Contents Cash Flows (in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 8,547 11,425 Net cash used in investing activities (22,098 (27,655 Net cash provided by financing activities - - Net decrease in cash and restricted cash (13,551 (16,230 Cash flows provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 2.9 million for the current year s period, when compared to the prior year s period, primarily due to an increase in net income of 2.1 million and a 2.4 million increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization (predominantly from production increases noted above), offset by a 0.7 million gain on sale of oil and gas properties and a fixed asset and a 6.7 million net decrease to our other components of working capital (predominantly from an increase in accruals and payables from our recent drilling and completion activity). Cash flows used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 5.6 million for the current year s period, when compared to the prior year s period, primarily due to 4.8 million less in capital spending, coupled with 0.8 million in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties in the current period. Cash flows financing activities. There were no cash flow financing activities in the current or prior period. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We have included EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this Report as supplements to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP measures of performance to provide investors with an additional financial analytical framework which management uses, in addition to historical operating results, as the basis for financial, operational and planning decisions and present measurements that third parties have indicated are useful in assessing the Company and its results of operations. EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA, less share-based compensation, gain on sale of oil and gas properties and gain on sale of fixed assets. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that we believe affect the comparability of operating results and can exclude items that are generally non-recurring in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because we believe they provide additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments. For example, although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. Additionally, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than PEDEVCO Corp. does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. You should not consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of the Company s results as reported under GAAP. The Company s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in their entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of net income to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands): 24 Table of Contents Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income 2,915 949 6,369 4,285 Add (deduct) Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 3,055 2,932 10,782 8,411 EBITDA 5,970 3,881 17,151 12,696 Add (deduct) Share-based compensation 464 511 1,401 1,546 Gain on sale of fixed assets - - (12 - Gain on sale of oil and gas properties (735 - (735 - Adjusted EBITDA 5,699 4,392 17,805 14,242 Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements. Oil and Gas Properties, Successful Efforts Method. The successful efforts method of accounting is used for oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under this method, all costs for development wells, support equipment and facilities, and proved mineral interests in oil and gas properties are capitalized. Geological and geophysical costs are expensed when incurred. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized as exploration and evaluation assets pending determination of whether the wells find proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, (i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made). Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. Exploratory wells in areas not requiring major capital expenditures are evaluated for economic viability within one year of completion of drilling. The related well costs are expensed as dry holes if it is determined that such economic viability is not attained. Otherwise, the related well costs are reclassified to oil and gas properties and subject to impairment review. For exploratory wells that are found to have economically viable reserves in areas where major capital expenditure will be required before production can commence, the related well costs remain capitalized only if additional drilling is under way or firmly planned. Otherwise, the related well costs are expensed as dry holes. Exploration and evaluation expenditures incurred subsequent to the acquisition of an exploration asset in a business combination are accounted for in accordance with the policy outlined above. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of capitalized oil and gas properties is calculated on a field-by-field basis using the unit of production method. Lease acquisition costs are amortized over the total estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves and all other capitalized costs are amortized over proved developed reserves. Costs specific to developmental wells for which drilling is in progress or uncompleted are capitalized as wells in progress and not subject to amortization until completion and production commences, at which time amortization on the basis of production will begin. 25 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition. The Company s revenue is comprised entirely of revenue from exploration and production activities. The Company s oil is sold primarily to marketers, gatherers, and refiners. Natural gas is sold primarily to interstate and intrastate natural-gas pipelines, direct end-users, industrial users, local distribution companies, and natural-gas marketers. NGLs are sold primarily to direct end-users, refiners, and marketers. Payment is generally received from the customer in the month following delivery. Contracts with customers have varying terms, including month-to-month contracts, and contracts with a finite term. The Company recognizes sales revenues for oil, natural gas, and NGLs based on the amount of each product sold to a customer when control transfers to the customer. Generally, control transfers at the time of delivery to the customer at a pipeline interconnect, the tailgate of a processing facility, or as a tanker lifting is completed. Revenue is measured based on the contract price, which may be index-based or fixed, and may include adjustments for market differentials and downstream costs incurred by the customer, including gathering, transportation, and fuel costs. Revenues are recognized for the sale of the Company s net share of production volumes. Sales on behalf of other working interest owners and royalty interest owners are not recognized as revenues. Stock-Based Compensation. Pursuant to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee service, we utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock option awards at the date of grant, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected volatility and expected life. Changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share-based compensation. These assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. When estimating fair value, some of the assumptions will be based on, or determined from, external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with stock-based payment arrangements. The appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment, based on relevant facts and circumstances. We estimate volatility by considering historical stock volatility. We have opted to use the simplified method for estimating expected term, which is equal to the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements . In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The amendments in this update expand segment disclosure requirements, including new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment among other disclosure requirements. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as information related to income taxes paid to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This ASU will be effective for the annual period ending December 31, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and impacts of adoption of this ASU. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, as appropriate, in order to allow timely decisions in connection with required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO )(the Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Accounting Officer CAO )(the Principal Financial/Accounting Officer), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CAO concluded as of September 30, 2024, that our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, including any corrective actions regarding significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 27 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings Although we may, from time to time, be involved in litigation and claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business, we are not currently a party to any material legal proceeding or government proceeding. Environmental Contingencies The nature of the natural gas and oil business carries with it certain environmental risks for us and our subsidiaries. We have implemented various policies, programs and procedures to attempt to reduce and mitigate such environmental risks. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Commission on March 18, 2024 (the Form 10-K ), under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors , other than as discussed below, and investors are encouraged to review such risk factors in the Annual Report and below, prior to making an investment in the Company. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. 28 Table of Contents The requirements, restrictions and covenants in our RBL, including interest payable thereunder, may restrict our ability to operate our business and might lead to a default under such agreement. As of the date of this Report, the RBL has a balance of 0. Amounts, if any, that we borrow under the RBL, are due on September 11, 2028. Borrowings under the RBL may be alternate base rate ABR loans or SOFR loans, at the election of the Company. Interest is payable quarterly for ABR loans and at the end of the applicable interest period for SOFR loans. SOFR loans bear interest at the forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York SOFR for a one, three or six-month interest period plus an applicable margin ranging from 300 to 400 basis points, depending on the percentage of the borrowing base utilized, plus an additional 10 basis point credit spread adjustment (the SOFR Rate ). ABR loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of: (i) the prime rate as publicly announced by Citibank; (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 50 basis points; and (iii) the adjusted forward-looking term rate based on SOFR for a one-month interest period plus 100 basis points, plus an applicable margin ranging from 200 to 300 basis points, depending on the percentage of the borrowing base utilized (the ABR Rate ). The Company also pays a commitment fee on unused commitment amounts under its facility of 37.5 basis points or 50 basis points, depending on the percentage of the borrowing base utilized. The Company may repay any amounts borrowed under the RBL prior to the maturity date without any premium or penalty, and is required to repay certain portions of the amounts borrowed under the RBL upon the occurrence of certain events. The RBL includes customary representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants of the Company for a facility of that size and type, including prohibiting the Loan Parties from creating any indebtedness without the consent of the lenders, subject to certain exceptions, and requiring the Company to have a net leverage ratio (the ratio of (a) total net debt to (b) EBITDAX) of no less than 1.0 to 1.0 and a current ratio (the ratio of (i) consolidated current assets to (ii) consolidated current liabilities) of no less than 1.0 to 1.0. EBITDAX is defined as Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation (or Depletion), Amortization, and Exploration Expense. In addition, the RBL is subject to customary events of default for a facility of this size and type, including a change in control. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the administrative agent may, with the consent of majority lenders, or shall, at the request of the majority lenders, accelerate any amounts outstanding and terminate lender commitments and declare the entire amount of obligations owed under the RBL immediately due and payable and take certain other actions provided for under the RBL. As a result of these requirements, covenants and limitations, we may not be able to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us. The breach of any of these requirements or covenants could result in a default under the RBL or future credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such RBL or future debt facilities, including accrued interest or other obligations, to be immediately due and payable. If amounts outstanding under such RBL or future debt facilities were to be accelerated, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness. A prolonged period of weak, or a significant decrease in, industry activity and overall markets may make it difficult to comply with our covenants and the other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt and current global and market conditions have increased the potential for that difficulty. Our obligations under the RBL are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets and various Company guarantees. The amounts borrowed pursuant to the terms of the RBL are secured by substantially all of the present and after-acquired assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the amounts due, and obligations under, the RBL. 29 Table of Contents As a result of the above, our creditors, in the event of the occurrence of a default under the RBL, may enforce their security interests over our assets and/or our subsidiaries which secure such obligations, may take control of our assets and operations, force us to seek bankruptcy protection, or force us to curtail or abandon our current business plans and operations. If that were to happen, any investment in the Company (including, but not limited to any investment in our common stock) could become worthless. Continued increases in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase and may have an adverse effect on our operations. The amounts borrowed under the RBL bear interest at either the SOFR Rate or the ABR Rate. Interest rates have recently been subject to increasing volatility and any increase in the interest rates associated with our floating-rate debt would increase our debt service costs and affect our results of operations. In addition, a future increase in interest rates could adversely affect our future ability to obtain financing or materially increase the cost of any additional financing. Changes in interest rates could also have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows. Because our future notes payable are expected to have variable interest rates, our business results are expected to be subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flows. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS The Company did not issue or sell any unregistered equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and through the date of the filing of this Report. Use of Proceeds From Sale of Registered Securities None. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers None. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. ITEM 4.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f)) adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement . 30 Table of Contents ITEM 6.
