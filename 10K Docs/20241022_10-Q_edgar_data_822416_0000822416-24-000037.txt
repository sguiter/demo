 million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Substantially all of our home sales are scheduled to close and be recorded to revenue within one year from the date of receiving a customer deposit. See Note 8 for information on warranties and related obligations. 
 
 Land sale and other revenues - We periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development. Land sales are generally outright sales of specified land parcels with cash consideration due on the closing date, which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied. Revenues related to our construction services operations are generally recognized as materials are delivered and installation services are provided. 
 
 Financial Services revenues - Loan origination fees, commitment fees, and discount points are recognized upon loan origination. Expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of interest rate lock commitments ("IRLCs") that are accounted for at fair value through Financial Services revenues at the time of commitment. Subsequent changes in the fair value of IRLCs and residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are reflected in Financial Services revenues as they occur. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold. Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans, and are accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the date that the servicing rights are sold. 
 
 Revenues associated with our title operations are recognized as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur as each home is closed. Insurance agency commissions relate to commissions on homeowner and other insurance policies placed with third-party carriers through various agency channels. Our performance obligations for policy renewal commissions are considered satisfied upon issuance of the initial policy. The related contract assets for estimated future renewal commissions are included in other assets and totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 million and million, respectively, and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million and million, respectively. Net gains from the sale of mortgages were million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and have been included in Financial Services revenues. 
 
 million and million, respectively. Since we can terminate a loan commitment if the borrower does not comply with the terms of the contract, and some loan commitments may expire without being drawn upon, these commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
 
 We hedge our exposure to interest rate market risk relating to residential mortgage loans available-for-sale and IRLCs using forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities, which are commitments to either purchase or sell a specified financial instrument at a specified future date for a specified price, and whole loan investor commitments, which are obligations of an investor to buy loans at a specified price within a specified time period. Forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are the predominant derivative financial instruments we use to minimize market risk during the period from the time we extend an interest rate lock to a loan applicant until the time the loan is sold to an investor. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had unexpired forward contracts of billion and million, respectively, and whole loan investor commitments of million and million, respectively.

 Our evaluations for land-related charges are based on our best estimates of the future cash flows from our communities. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, the significant volatility in demand for new housing, the long life cycles of certain of our communities, and potential changes in our strategy related to certain communities, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates.

 Revolving credit facility 
 
 We maintain a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") maturing in June 2027 that has a maximum borrowing capacity of billion and contains an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the capacity to billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit that reduce the available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility, up to the maximum borrowing capacity. The interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be based on either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or a base rate plus an applicable margin, as defined therein. The Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum Tangible Net Worth and a maximum Debt-to-Capitalization Ratio (as each term is defined in the Revolving Credit Facility). We were in compliance with all covenants and requirements as of September 30, 2024. Outstanding balances under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had borrowings outstanding, million of letters of credit issued, and million of remaining capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2023, we had borrowings outstanding, million of letters of credit issued, and million of remaining capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 Joint venture debt 
 
 At September 30, 2024, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was million. 
 
 Financial Services debt 
 
 Pulte Mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement with third-party lenders (as amended, the "Repurchase Agreement") that matures on August 13, 2025. The maximum aggregate commitment under the Repurchase Agreement was million at September 30, 2024 and will decrease to million on January 14, 2025, which continues until maturity. The Repurchase Agreement also contains an accordion feature that could increase the commitment by million above its active commitment level. Borrowings under the Repurchase Agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. The Repurchase Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to Pulte Mortgage, including quantitative thresholds related to net worth, net income, and liquidity. At September 30, 2024, Pulte Mortgage had million outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of and million of remaining capacity under the Repurchase Agreement. At December 31, 2023, Pulte Mortgage had million outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of and million of remaining capacity under the prior agreement replaced by the Repurchase Agreement. Pulte Mortgage was in compliance with all covenants and requirements as of September 30, 2024.

 million and repurchased million shares under our repurchase authorization for million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we declared cash dividends totaling million and repurchased million shares under our repurchase authorization for million. On January 30, 2024, the Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by billion. At September 30, 2024, we had remaining authorization to repurchase billion of common shares. 
 
 Under our share-based compensation plans, we accept shares as payment under certain conditions related to the vesting of shares, generally related to the payment of minimum tax obligations. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, participants surrendered shares valued at million and million, respectively, under these plans. Such share transactions are excluded from the above noted share repurchase authorization.

 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with and for the same periods in 2023. Our effective tax rate for each of these periods differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income tax expense. Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 also includes a benefit of million associated with the purchase of transferable federal renewable energy tax credits. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also reflects a reduction in income tax liabilities totaling million related to the favorable resolution of uncertain state tax positions. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had net deferred tax liabilities of million and million, respectively. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between estimated and actual results could result in changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the realization of deferred tax assets over time. 
 
 Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes.

In the event any such letter of credit or surety bond is drawn, we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit or surety bond. Our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates; rather we are released from the surety bonds as the underlying contractual performance is completed. Because significant construction and development work has been performed related to projects that have not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties, the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed. We do not believe that a material amount, if any, of the letters of credit or surety bonds will be drawn.

 comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home's construction and operating systems for periods of up to, and, in limited instances, exceeding, years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record liabilities in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liabilities include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and the projected cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the warranty liabilities for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary. Actual warranty costs in the future could differ from the current estimates.

million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both (i) existing claims and related claim expenses and (ii) IBNR and related claim expenses. Liabilities related to IBNR and related claim expenses represented approximately and of the total general liability reserves at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The actuarial analyses that determine the IBNR portion of reserves consider a variety of factors, including the frequency and severity of losses, which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data. The actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third-party recovery rates and claims management expenses. 
 
 Volatility in both national and local housing market conditions may affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. Additionally, IBNR estimates comprise the majority of our liability and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns, third party recoveries, insurance industry practices, the regulatory environment, and legal precedent. State regulations vary, but construction defect claims are typically reported and resolved over an extended time period often exceeding ten years. Changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses, which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves. Because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses and the timing of such losses related to these claims, actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs. 
 
 Adjustments to reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. We reduced general liability reserves by million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of changes in estimates resulting from actual claim experience being less than anticipated in previous actuarial projections. The changes in actuarial estimates were driven by changes in actual claims experience that, in turn, impacted actuarial estimates for potential future claims. These changes in actuarial estimates did not involve any changes in actuarial methodology but did impact the development of estimates for future periods, which resulted in adjustments to the IBNR portion of our recorded liabilities. There were no material adjustments to individual claims. Costs associated with our insurance programs are classified within selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The following is a summary of our operating results by line of business 000's omitted, except per share data): 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income before income taxes: Homebuilding 851,270 818,365 2,663,868 2,413,103 Financial Services 54,926 28,949 159,283 89,346 Income before income taxes 906,196 847,314 2,823,151 2,502,449 Income tax expense (208,282) (208,539) (653,128) (611,070) Net income 697,914 638,775 2,170,023 1,891,379 Diluted earnings per share 3.35 2.90 10.28 8.45 
 In 2022, the Federal Reserve began raising its benchmark interest rate in response to persistent inflation that began after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. These actions drove national mortgage and other interest rates higher and negatively impacted home affordability and consumer sentiment. Despite this rise in interest rates, demand for new homes generally remained strong during 2023 and into 2024. Despite a recent 50 bps cut in the Federal Reserve benchmark interest rate late in the third quarter of 2024, affordability remains challenged for housing due to the higher interest rates, house price increases, and general inflation in recent years as compared with historical levels. We have responded by adjusting sales prices where necessary and focusing sales incentives on closing cost incentives and mortgage interest rate buydowns. Additionally, the rate of customer order cancellations that spiked in 2022 in response to higher inflation and interest rate increases has now normalized to historical levels. 
 
 We operate our business to generate a consistent cadence of house starts and an appropriate inventory of quick move-in speculative ("spec") homes as we focus on turning our assets and delivering high returns on investment, which has allowed us to achieve an effective balance of price and pace. Within an evolving macroeconomic environment, consumers across all buyer segments and price points have continued demonstrating a strong desire for homeownership despite continued interest rate variability. During 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, through a combination of our ongoing construction cost reduction initiatives, construction pacing, and sales strategies that capitalized on periods of strong consumer demand, we were able to achieve historically strong financial results. 
 
 The supply chain constraints that arose in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic improved during 2023 and have continued to ease during the first nine months of 2024, which has contributed to a shortening of our production cycle times. The time required to construct a home was approximately seven weeks shorter at the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared to the comparable prior year period, and nearly two weeks shorter than at the end of the second quarter of 2024. This decrease in cycle times, coupled with our strong backlog and focus on spec home production, contributed to an increase in closings of 12 and 10 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, over the comparable prior year periods. While production cycle times remain elevated versus our historical norms due to the availability of certain materials and construction labor, along with extended timelines for municipal approvals and inspections in certain geographies, we continue to make progress. Inflation also continues to impact our business, especially the cost of land and related development expenditures. Due to the length of our construction cycle times, there is a lag between when such cost changes occur and when they impact our operating results. 
 
 We remain focused on taking a measured approach to our capital allocation strategy in order to position ourselves to effectively respond to any potential future volatility in demand. Accordingly, we are focused on protecting liquidity and closely managing our cash flows while also continuing to focus on shareholder returns, including the following actions: 
 
 Increasing our lot optionality within our land pipeline for increased flexibility; 
 Producing sufficient levels of spec inventory (houses without customer orders) to service buyers seeking to close within 30 to 90 days; 
 22 

Maintaining a focus on shareholder return through share buybacks and dividends, including a 25 increase in our dividends from 0.16 to 0.20 per share effective with our January 2024 dividend payment; 
 Taking an opportunistic approach to repurchasing debt; and 
 Maintaining ample liquidity. 
 
 The limited supply of both new and existing homes for sale, continuing low levels of unemployment, and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. We believe our strategic approach with respect to sales incentives, advertising, and our production cadence will enable us to meet consumer demand at the selling prices necessary to turn our inventory, maintain market share, and generate healthy returns. We remain confident in our ability to navigate this environment and to position the Company to take advantage of opportunities as they arise to support future growth and continued profitability and financial strength.

Home sale revenues 
 
 Home sale revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were higher than the prior year period by 456.3 million and 1.2 billion, respectively. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the 12 increase resulted primarily from a 12 increase in closings. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 10 increase resulted primarily from a 10 increase in closings. The increases in closings were primarily attributable to a strong backlog, improved production cycle times, and initiatives to prioritize quick move-in spec homes to satisfy customer desire to quickly close on homes due to the volatile interest rate environment and to ensure an efficient production cadence of homes. Average selling price during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained flat compared with the respective prior year periods. 
 
 Home sale gross margins 
 
 Home sale gross margins were 28.8 and 29.4 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 29.5 and 29.4 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Due to the low supply of new and existing homes for sale, we were generally able to maintain net sales pricing to substantially offset increases in house and land costs and higher sales incentives over these periods. However, we expect sales incentives, especially mortgage interest rate buydowns, to remain elevated to address buyer affordability challenges, which will continue to impact our gross margins in the near term. 
 
 Land sale and other revenues 
 
 We periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development. Land sale and other revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods, depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions. Land sales and other revenues contributed losses of 6.0 million and 4.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with gains of 4.9 million and 15.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 SG A 
 
 SG A as a percentage of home sale revenues was 9.4 and 8.9 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 9.1 and 8.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The gross dollar amount of our SG A increased 53.7 million, or 15 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the prior year period, and increased 121.3 million, or 12 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the prior year period. The increases in gross dollars for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from overhead costs to support increased production volumes, partially offset by insurance reserve reversals of 78.7 million recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with insurance reserve reversals of 66.2 million recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other income, net 
 
 Other income, net includes the following 000 s omitted): 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs (4,732) (2,456) (12,406) (9,629) Amortization of intangible assets (2,498) (2,623) (7,536) (7,915) Gain (loss) on debt retirement 362 (222) 362 Interest income 13,748 19,303 48,268 41,701 Interest expense (120) (120) (352) (347) Miscellaneous, net 3,304 3,965 11,957 9,664 Total other income, net 9,702 18,431 39,709 33,836 
 
 Interest income began to increase significantly in 2023 and has continued to do so into 2024 as the result of higher returns on invested cash balances due to the elevated interest rate environment. 
 24 

Net new orders 
 
 Net new orders in units decreased less than 1 while net new orders in dollars increased 3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the prior year period. Net new orders in units increased 3 while net new orders in dollars increased 9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the prior year period. The increase in net new order dollars in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to geographic mix, including our West segment, which carries a higher average selling price. The increased net new order volume and dollars in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the comparable prior year period was primarily attributable to the higher volumes in our West segment. Cancellation rates (canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period) were 15 and 14 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 15 in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cancellation rates began to decrease in 2023 and have now returned to historical levels. Ending backlog dollars, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, decreased 5 at September 30, 2024 compared with September 30, 2023. 
 
 Homes in production 
 
 The following is a summary of our homes in production: 
 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Sold 9,684 10,657 Unsold Under construction 6,055 5,752 Completed 1,357 967 7,412 6,719 Models 1,537 1,465 Total 18,633 18,841 
 
 The number of homes in production at September 30, 2024 was 1 lower than at September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decreased number of sold homes due to increased closings and lower backlog. This decrease was partially offset by a higher number of homes under construction and completed homes, which reflects our strategic decision to increase starts of spec units in response to buyer demand for quick move-in homes. 
 
 Controlled lots 
 
 The following is a summary of our lots under control at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Owned Optioned Controlled Owned Optioned Controlled Northeast 3,881 6,533 10,414 4,204 8,718 12,922 Southeast 18,040 33,061 51,101 18,911 27,666 46,577 Florida 25,655 33,388 59,043 26,922 35,543 62,465 Midwest 11,948 20,359 32,307 12,290 14,461 26,751 Texas 16,207 23,615 39,822 16,487 17,378 33,865 West 27,742 14,113 41,855 25,701 14,349 40,050 Total 103,473 131,069 234,542 104,515 118,115 222,630 44 56 100 47 53 100 Developed ) 46 21 32 45 18 31 
 
 While competition for well-positioned land is robust, we continued to pursue land investments that we believe can achieve appropriate risk-adjusted returns on invested capital. We have also continued to seek to maintain a high percentage of our lots that are controlled via land option agreements as such contracts enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by 
 25 

third parties or unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option, which reduces our financial risks associated with long-term land holdings. The remaining purchase price under our land option agreements totaled 8.1 billion at September 30, 2024.

 Texas 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024, Texas home sale revenues increased 18 when compared with the prior year period due to a 23 increase in closings partially offset by a 4 decrease in average selling price. The increase in closings occurred across all markets while the decrease in average selling price occurred across the majority of markets. Income before income taxes decreased 4 , primarily due to increased overhead costs across all markets and decreased gross margins across the majority of markets. The decrease in net new orders was mixed among markets.

Financial Services Operations 
 
 We conduct our Financial Services operations, which include mortgage banking, title, and insurance agency operations, through Pulte Mortgage LLC ("Pulte Mortgage") and other subsidiaries. In originating mortgage loans, we initially use our own funds supplemented by funds available pursuant to a credit agreement with third parties. Substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination, generally within 30 days. We also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans. This strategy results in owning loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time. Operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to support our Homebuilding operations, the business levels of our Financial Services operations are highly correlated to Homebuilding, as Homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all of its 
 30 

business. We believe that our mortgage capture rate, which represents loan originations from our Homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our Homebuilding operations, excluding cash closings, is an important metric in evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model. The following tables present selected financial information for our Financial Services operations 000's omitted):

 Revenues 
 
 Total Financial Services revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 48 and 40 , respectively, compared with the same periods in 2023. The increases during 2024 when compared with the prior year periods were primarily due to an increase in origination volumes resulting from higher closings within Homebuilding and improved capture rates. Revenues per loan also increased as the result of a more favorable operating environment for Financial Services. The increased use of closing cost incentives in the form of mortgage interest rate buydowns has also contributed favorably to the Financial Services volumes and revenues per transaction. 
 
 Income before income taxes 
 Income before income taxes in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 90 and 78 , respectively, compared with the same period in 2023. The increases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when 
 31 

compared with the prior year periods were primarily due to the higher loan origination volume, capture rate, and revenue per transaction. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Our effective tax rate was 23.0 and 23.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 24.6 and 24.4 for the same periods in 2023. Our effective tax rate for each of these periods differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income tax expense. Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 also includes a benefit of 14.3 million associated with the purchase of transferable federal renewable energy tax credits. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also reflects a reduction in income tax liabilities totaling 13.2 million related to the favorable resolution of uncertain state tax positions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We finance our land acquisition, development, and construction activities and financial services operations using internally-generated funds, supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing. We routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate accessing available financing sources, including revolving bank credit and securities offerings. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and equivalents of 1.4 billion, restricted cash balances of 57.5 million, and 939.1 million available under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization, excluding our Financial Services debt, was 12.3 at September 30, 2024, compared with 15.9 at December 31, 2023. We follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality, highly liquid, short-term deposits and investments, which helps mitigate banking concentration risk. 
 
 For the next twelve months, we expect our principal demand for funds will be for the acquisition and development of land inventory, construction of house inventory, and operating expenses, including our general and administrative expenses. The increase in sales and related increased pace in starts, coupled with the elongation of our production cycle compared to historical levels, has required a greater investment of cash in our homes under production. Additionally, we plan to continue our dividend payments and repurchases of common stock. In August 2025, we need to repay or refinance Pulte Mortgage's master repurchase agreement with third-party lenders (as amended, the "Repurchase Agreement"). While we intend to refinance the Repurchase Agreement, there can be no assurances that the Repurchase Agreement can be renewed or replaced on commercially reasonable terms upon its expiration. However, we believe we have adequate liquidity to meet Pulte Mortgage's anticipated financing needs. Beyond the next twelve months, we will need to repay or refinance our Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in June 2027, and our unsecured senior notes, the next tranche of which becomes due in 2026. We may from time to time repurchase our unsecured senior notes through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed repurchases of 193.4 million and 106.6 million aggregate principal amount of our unsecured senior notes scheduled to mature in 2026 and 2027, respectively, through a cash tender offer. Our total repurchases in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, including open market repurchases, were 310.2 million. 
 
 We believe that our current cash position and other available financing resources, coupled with our ongoing operating activities, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business needs over the next twelve months and beyond. To the extent the sources of capital described above are insufficient to meet our needs, we may also conduct additional public offerings of our securities, refinance debt, dispose of certain assets to fund our operating activities, or draw on existing or new debt facilities. 
 
 Unsecured senior notes 
 
 We had 1.6 billion and 1.9 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with no repayments due until March 2026, when 251.9 million of unsecured senior notes are scheduled to mature. 
 
 Other notes payable 
 
 Other notes payable include non-recourse and limited recourse secured notes with third parties that totaled 41.1 million and 71.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These notes have maturities ranging up to six years, are secured by the applicable land positions to which they relate, and generally have no recourse to other assets. The stated interest rates on these notes range up to 5 . 
 
 32 

Revolving credit facility 
 
 We maintain a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") maturing in June 2027 that has a maximum borrowing capacity of 1.3 billion and contains an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the capacity to 1.8 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit that reduce the available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility, up to the maximum borrowing capacity. The interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be based on either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or a base rate plus an applicable margin, as defined therein. The Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum Tangible Net Worth and a maximum Debt-to-Capitalization Ratio (as each term is defined in the Revolving Credit Facility). We were in compliance with all covenants and requirements as of September 30, 2024. Outstanding balances under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding, 310.9 million of letters of credit issued, and 939.1 million of remaining capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding, 312.7 million of letters of credit issued, and 937.3 million of remaining capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 Joint venture debt 
 
 At September 30, 2024, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 35.2 million. 
 
 Financial Services debt 
 
 Pulte Mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement with third-party lenders (as amended, the "Repurchase Agreement") that matures on August 13, 2025. The maximum aggregate commitment under the Repurchase Agreement was 675.0 million at September 30, 2024 and will decrease to 650.0 million on January 14, 2025, which continues until maturity. The Repurchase Agreement also contains an accordion feature that could increase the commitment by 50.0 million above its active commitment level. Borrowings under the Repurchase Agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. The Repurchase Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to Pulte Mortgage, including quantitative thresholds related to net worth, net income, and liquidity. At September 30, 2024, Pulte Mortgage had 524.1 million outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 6.65 and 150.9 million of remaining capacity under the Repurchase Agreement. At December 31, 2023, Pulte Mortgage had 499.6 million outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 7.15 and 350.4 million of remaining capacity under the prior agreement replaced by the Repurchase Agreement. Pulte Mortgage was in compliance with all covenants and requirements as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Dividends and share repurchase program 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we declared cash dividends totaling 126.2 million and repurchased 7.6 million shares under our repurchase authorization for 880.0 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we declared cash dividends totaling 106.8 million and repurchased 10.2 million shares under our repurchase authorization for 700.0 million. On January 30, 2024, the Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by 1.5 billion. At September 30, 2024, we had remaining authorization to repurchase 1.0 billion of common shares. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, while others are considered future commitments. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, purchase obligations related to expected acquisitions and development of land, house construction costs, operating leases, and obligations under our various compensation and benefit plans. 
 
 33 

We use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our homebuilding projects and insurance programs. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects and insurance programs. If the obligations related to a project or program are ongoing, annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a year-to-year basis. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 310.9 million. Our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated 2.8 billion at September 30, 2024, are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years. Because significant construction and development work has been performed related to projects that have not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties, the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At September 30, 2024, these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of 8.1 billion. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we generally provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. At September 30, 2024, outstanding deposits totaled 556.0 million, of which 16.2 million is refundable. 
 
 For further information regarding our primary obligations, refer to Note 4 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on 10-Q for amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024 related to debt and commitments and contingencies, respectively. 
 
 Cash flows 
 
 Operating activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.1 billion. Generally, the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in the levels of inventory and residential mortgage loans available-for-sale, each of which experiences seasonal fluctuations. The cash inflows from our operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to net income of 2.2 billion, partially offset by a net increase in inventories of 805.3 million, which was primarily attributable to land acquisition, development, and house spend to support future growth, and a 45.2 million increase in residential mortgage loans available due to higher loan origination volumes. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1.9 billion. The cash inflows from our operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to net income of 1.9 billion along with a seasonal 262.6 million decrease in residential mortgage loans available-for-sale, partially offset by a net increase in inventories of 173.4 million. 
 
 Investing activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 108.4 million. These cash outflows primarily resulted from capital expenditures of 94.1 million related to our ongoing investments in new communities, facilities, and information technology applications along with 15.1 million of investments in unconsolidated entities. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 95.0 million. These cash outflows primarily related to capital expenditures of 67.6 million related to our ongoing investments in new communities, facilities, and information technology applications along with 18.1 million of investments in unconsolidated entities. 
 
 Financing activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 1.4 billion. These cash outflows resulted primarily from the repurchase of 7.6 million common shares for 880.0 million under our share repurchase authorization, payments of 126.6 million in cash dividends, payments of 94.1 million related to consolidated inventory not owned, and 350.5 million of repayments of notes payable, partially offset by net Financial Services borrowings of 24.5 million related to an increase in residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 1.0 billion. These cash outflows resulted primarily from the repurchase of 10.2 million common shares for 700.0 million under our share repurchase authorization, payments of 107.7 million in cash dividends, 86.8 million of repayments of notes payable, and net Financial Services repayments of 161.3 million related to a seasonal reduction in residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. 
 34 

Seasonality 
 
 Although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again, we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry. We generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings. This seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes. As a result of the seasonality of our operations, our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. 
 
 Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, PulteGroup, Inc. had outstanding 1.6 billion principal amount of unsecured senior notes due at dates from March 2026 through February 2035 and no borrowings outstanding, 310.9 million of letters of credit issued, and 939.1 million of remaining capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 All of our unsecured senior notes and the Revolving Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain subsidiaries of PulteGroup, Inc. ("Guarantors" or "Guarantor Subsidiaries"). Each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries is 100 owned, directly or indirectly, by PulteGroup, Inc. Our subsidiaries associated with our financial services operations and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the unsecured senior notes or the Revolving Credit Facility (collectively, "Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries"). The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor and rank equal with all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor and senior to all subordinated debt of such Guarantor. The guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. 
 
 A court could void or subordinate any Guarantor s guarantee under the fraudulent conveyance laws if existing or future creditors of any such Guarantor were successful in establishing that such Guarantor: 
 
 (a) incurred the guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors; or 
 
 (b) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for incurring the guarantee and, in the case of any one of the following being true at the time thereof: 
 
 such Guarantor was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the incurrence of the guarantee; 
 the incurrence of the guarantee left such Guarantor with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on its business; 
 such Guarantor intended to, or believed that it would, incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature; or 
 such Guarantor was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it, if the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. 
 
 The measures of insolvency for purposes of determining whether a fraudulent conveyance occurred would vary depending upon the laws of the relevant jurisdiction and upon the valuation assumptions and methodology applied by the court. However, in general, a court would deem a company insolvent if: 
 
 the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; 
 the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or 
 it could not pay its debts as they became due. 
 
 The guarantees of the senior notes contain a provision to limit each Guarantor s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. However, under recent case law, this provision may not be effective to protect such guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law or otherwise determined to be unenforceable. If a court were to find that the incurrence of a guarantee was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under that guarantee, could subordinate that guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Guarantor or could require the holders of the senior notes to repay any amounts received with respect to that guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, holders may not receive any repayment on the senior notes. 
 
 35 

Finally, as a court of equity, a bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the guarantees to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (1) the holder of senior notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (2) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of senior notes and (3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the bankruptcy code. 
 
 On the basis of historical financial information, operating history and other factors, we believe that each of the Guarantors, after giving effect to the issuance of the guarantees when such guarantees were issued, was not insolvent, did not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it engaged and did not and has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. We cannot, however, provide assurances as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or whether a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with those contained in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Quantitative disclosure 
 We are subject to market risk on our debt instruments primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates. We utilize both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. For fixed-rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable-rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the debt instrument but could affect our earnings and cash flows. Except in very limited circumstances, we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed-rate debt prior to maturity. As a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed-rate debt until we are required or elect to refinance or repurchase such debt.
