of hel d to maturity securities and no related valuation account. 
 For available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company will first assess whether (i) it intends to sell or (ii) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either case is applicable, any previously recognized allowances are charged off and the debt security s amortized cost is written down to fair value through income. If neither case is applicable, the debt security is evaluated to determine whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the debt security by a rating agency and any adverse conditions specifically related to the debt security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the debt security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount by which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in the income statement as a component of credit loss expense. Available for sale debt securities are charged off against the allowance or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through income when deemed uncollectible by the Company or when either of the aforementioned criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. 
 The Company excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on debt securities and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. The accrued interest receivable on securities was and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Other Equity Securities 
 The mutual funds owned by the Company are classified as equity securities and are carried at fair value with any periodic changes in value recorded through the statement of income.

and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposure 
 The Company also has off-balance sheet financial instruments, which include unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. The Company minimizes these risks through underwriting guidelines and prudent risk management techniques. For off-balance sheet instruments, the allowance for credit losses is calculated in accordance with Topic 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if the Company has the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. The allowance is reported as a component of other liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments are reported in the income statement as a component of other operating expense. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet financial instruments was and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 The Company periodically provides modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. These modifications include either payment deferrals, term extensions, interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness or combinations of modification types. The determination of whether the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of the modification. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of principal forgiveness is charged off against the allowance for credit losses with a corresponding reduction in the amortized cost basis of the loan. A modified loan is tracked for at least 12 months following the modifications granted.

impairment existed at September 30, 2024. 
 Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred (i.e., a triggering event). The Company performed a goodwill impairment test in September 2024. The qualitative factors considered in determining if fair value of the unit was less than the carrying amount were economic conditions related to the change in the interest rate environment. A quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment included determining the estimated fair value of Company using a market-based approach. It was determined there was impairment. 
 Core Deposit Intangible 
 A core deposit intangible is initially recognized based on a valuation, of acquired deposits, performed as of the acquisition date. The core deposit intangible is amortized over the average remaining life of the acquired customer deposits, or approximately years. The intangible asset is reviewed annually for events or circumstances that could negatively impact the recoverability of the intangible. These events could include loss of core deposits, increased competition, or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent this intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded. The Company maintains steady deposit growth across our markets and continues to attract new customer deposits. The intangible asset was evaluated for impairment as of September 30, 2024 and based on that evaluation there was impairment.

Because the Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before recovery of the amortized cost bases, at maturity, the Company does not consider these securities to be credit impaired at September 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, no allowance for credit losses has been recognized on available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position as the Company does not believe any of the debt securities are credit impaired. This is based on the Company s analysis of the risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors related to available for sale debt securities. The issuers of these debt securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. The Company does not intend to sell these debt securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost, which may be at maturity. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the debt securities were purchased. Management measures expected credit losses on held to maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics and considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. With regard to securities issued by states and political subdivisions, management considers (i) issuer bond ratings, (ii) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities, and (iv) internal forecasts. Historical loss rates associated with securities having similar grades as those in our portfolio have generally not been significant. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2024, there were no past due principal or interest payments associated with these securities. Based upon (i) the issuer s strong bond ratings and (ii) a zero historical loss rate, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for held to maturity state and municipal securities as such amount is not material at September 30, 2024. All debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 continue to perform as scheduled and the Company does not believe there is a possible credit loss or that an allowance for credit loss on these debt securities is necessary.

 For purposes of the disclosures required pursuant to ASC 310, the loan portfolio was disaggregated into segments and then further disaggregated into classes for certain disclosures. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses. There are loan portfolio segments that include real estate, commercial and industrial, and consumer and other. A class is generally determined based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristic of the loan, and an entity s method for monitoring and assessing credit risk. Commercial and industrial is a separate commercial loan class. Classes within the real estate portfolio segment include construction and development, residential mortgages, and commercial mortgages. Consumer loans and other are a class in itself.

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This standard eliminated the previous accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings and added additional disclosure requirements for gross charge offs by year of origination. It also prescribes guidance for reporting modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 
 From time to time, we may modify certain loans to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. In some cases, these modifications may result in new loans. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of a principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, a payment delay, a term extension, or a combination thereof, among other things.

 NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Standby letters of credit 
 Total 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate, and income-producing commercial properties. 
 Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. Collateral held varies and is required in instances that the Company deems necessary. 
 The Company has not been required to perform on any standby letters of credit, and the Company has not incurred any losses on financial standby letters of credit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 Contingencies 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management, any liability resulting from such proceedings would not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements .

 percent of the Company s loan portfolio is concentrated in real estate. A substantial portion of these loans are secured by real estate in the Company s primary market area. In addition, a substantial portion of the other real estate owned is located in those same markets. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and the recovery of the carrying amount of the other real estate owned are susceptible to changes in market conditions in the Company s primary market area. The other concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note 5.

 The Bank is also subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total capital, Tier 1 capital, and common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. In addition, the Bank is subject to a capital conservation buffer that requires it to maintain common equity Tier 1 capital of 2.50 above minimum requirements for the common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 risk-based ratio and total risk-based ratio to avoid limitations on distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The capital conservation buffer is included in the minimum capital requirements in the following tables. Management believes, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, that the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank believe they are each well capitalized on a consolidated basis for bank regulatory purposes as their respective capital ratios exceed minimum total, Tier 1 and CET1 risk-based capital ratios and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios as set forth in the following table. As a bank holding company with less than 3,000,000 in total consolidated assets, the Company is eligible to be treated as a small bank holding company under the Federal Reserve s Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement. As a result, the Company s capital adequacy is evaluated at the bank level and on a parent-only basis, and it is not subject to consolidated capital standards for regulatory purposes. The ratios set forth below as to the Company are for illustrative purposes in the event it was to become subject to consolidated capital standards for regulatory purposes. The column styled Required for Capital Adequacy Purposes includes the 2.50 capital conservation buffer. 
 The Bank is also subject to capital requirements under the FDIC s prompt corrective action regime. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

 Individually Analyzed Loans 
 Loans considered individually analyzed under ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, are loans for which, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all principal and interest payments due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Individually analyzed loans can be measured based on the present value of expected payments using the loan s original effective rate as the discount rate, the loan s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent. 
 The fair value of individually analyzed loans are primarily measured based on the value of the collateral securing these loans. Impaired loans are typically classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Collateral may be real estate and/or business assets including equipment, inventory, and/or accounts receivable. The Company determines the value of the collateral based on independent appraisals performed by qualified licensed appraisers. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Appraised values are discounted for costs to sell and may be discounted further based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the date of the most recent appraisal, and/or management s expertise and knowledge of the customer and the customer s business. Such discounts by management are subjective and are typically significant unobservable inputs for determining fair value. Impaired loans are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly, based on the same factors discussed above. 
 Foreclosed Assets 
 Foreclosed assets, consisting of properties/assets obtained through foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans, are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell upon transfer of the loans to foreclosed assets. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair values are generally based on third party appraisals of the property/assets and are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The appraisals are sometimes further discounted based on management s historical knowledge, and/or changes in market conditions from the date of the most recent appraisal, and/or management s expertise and knowledge of the customer and the customer s business. Such discounts are typically significant unobservable inputs for determining fair value. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, a loss is recognized in noninterest expense.

 Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business 
 The most significant factors we use to evaluate our business and results of operation are net income, return on average assets and return on average equity. We also use net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is our principal source of net income and represents the difference between interest income and interest expense. We generate interest income from interest-earning assets that we own, including loans and investment securities. We incur interest expense from interest-bearing liabilities, including interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings, notably FHLB advances, our subordinated notes (the Notes and our Line of Credit. 
 Changes in the market interest rates and interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes. 
 Noninterest Income 
 Noninterest income primarily consists of: (i) service charges on deposit accounts; (ii) swap fees; (iii) SBA/USDA fees; (iv) bank card services and interchange fees; (v) mortgage banking activities; (vi) benefits from changes in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance BOLI and (vii) other miscellaneous fees and income. 
 Our income from service charges on deposit accounts, which includes nonsufficient funds fees, is impacted by several factors, including number of accounts, products utilized and account holder cash management behaviors. These are further impacted by deposit products utilized by customers, marketing of new products and other factors. The income recognized on SBA and USDA loans, mortgage banking and interest rate swaps are impacted by prevailing market conditions and volumes of loans originated. 
 Noninterest Expense 
 Noninterest expense primarily consists of: (i) salaries and employee benefits; (ii) equipment and occupancy expenses; (iii) professional and other service fees; (iv) data processing and telecommunication expenses; (v) FDIC deposit insurance and regulatory assessments; and (vi) other operating expenses. 
 
 Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Financial Condition 
 The most significant factors we use to evaluate and manage our financial condition include asset quality, capital and liquidity. 
 Asset Quality 
 We monitor the quality of our assets based upon factors including level and severity of deterioration in borrower cash flows and asset quality. Problem assets are assessed and reported as delinquent, classified, nonperforming or nonaccrual. We also monitor credit concentrations. We manage the allowance for credit losses to reflect loan volumes, identified credit and collateral conditions, economic conditions and other qualitative factors. 
 Capital 
 We monitor capital using regulatory capital ratios. Factors used other than regulatory rules include overall financial condition, including the trend and volume of problem assets, reserves, risks, level and quality of earnings, and anticipated growth, including acquisitions. 
 Liquidity 
 Deposits primarily consist of commercial and personal accounts maintained by businesses and individuals in our primary market areas. We also utilize brokered deposits, Qwickrate certificates of deposits and reciprocal deposits through a third-party network that effectively allows depositors to receive insurance on amounts greater than the FDIC insurance limit, which is currently 250,000. We manage liquidity based on factors that include the amount of core deposits to total deposits, level of non-customer deposits, short-term funding needs and sources, and the availability of unused funding sources.

 Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 We had net income of 7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to net income of 6.6 millio n for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 724,000, or 10.9 . The increased net income was primarily the result of a significant increases in noninterest income and net interest income, which was considerably offset by substantial increases in noninterest expense and credit loss provision, coupled with a less substantial increase in income taxes. The acquisition of Century Bank had a considerable impact to net income. 
 The following table shows the average outstanding balance of each principal category of our assets, liabilities and stockholders equity, together with the average yields on our assets and average costs of our liabilities for the periods indicated. Yields and costs are calculated by dividing the annualized income or expense by the average daily balances of the corresponding assets or liabilities for the same period.

 The following tables set forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income during the periods shown. Information is provided with respect to: (i) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior rate); and (ii) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been proportionately allocated to both volume and rate.

 Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 24.2 million compared to 20.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.5 million, or 17.0 . The increase in net interest income was comprised of a 9.9 million, or 28.0 , increase in interest income, partially offset by a 6.3 million, or 43.9 , increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily a result of a 393.7 million, or 22.6 , increase in average loans outstanding from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024, coupled with a 0.35 increase in average loan yield as higher rate loans were recorded from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The increase in average loans outstanding was due to growth, partially as a result of the Century Bank acquisition. The 6.3 million increase in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was substantially due to a 0.54 increase in the cost paid on interest-bearing liabilities, coupled with an increase of 407.0 million, or 25.4 , in average interest-bearing liabilities from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was due to growth, partially as a result of the Century Bank acquisition. Competitive rate pressures continue to negatively impact the cost of interest-bearing deposits, though the acquisition of Century Bank resulted in slightly lower costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.65 and 2.66 , respectively, compared to 3.78 and 2.84 , respectively, for the same period in 2023. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for cre dit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.6 million compared to 773,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included an immediate 1.7 million provision as a result of the acquisition of Century Bank as well as additional provisions based on growth, whereas provision for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was based primarily on growth. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were net charge offs of 350,000. In the three months ended September 30, 2023 , there were net recoveries of 23,000. 
 The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of gross loans was 1.27 and 1.25 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Noninterest Income 
 Noninterest income for the three months e nded September 30, 2024 was 1.8 million compared to (2.9) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.7 million, or 160.7 . The three months ended September 30, 2023 included a 5.1 million payment to the Internal Revenue Service IRS for the return of Employee Retention Credit and related revenue ERC ), which was received during the second quarter of 2023. The IRS revised eligibility guidelines during the third quarter of 2023, and the Company applied for the ERC Voluntary Disclosure Program ERC-VDP and removed this from income and recorded a payable. The acquisition of Century Bank resulted in additional noninterest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was partially offset by a decline in swap fees during the third quarter of 2024, substantially as a result of the Company not participating in any swap transactions during the period. 
 The following table sets forth the major components of our noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024

 SBA/USDA fees primarily include gains on the sale of loans and servicing of the loans. These fees increased 105,000 , or 141.9 , to 179,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 74,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to a gain on the sale of loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was slightly offset by a reduction in servicing income during the three same period. 
 Bank card services and interchange fees are derived from debit cards and foreign ATM transactions. These fees increased 140,000, or 36.0 , to 529,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 389,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to more transactional volume, partially as a result of the acquisition of Century Bank, which generated an increase in fees during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income from mortgage banking activities primarily includes origination fees and gains on the sale of mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Income from mortgage banking activities decreased 46,000, or 29.1 , to 112,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 158,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 This decrease was th e result of decreased volumes in the secondary market primarily based on reduced mortgage demand from increased interest rates. The acquisition of Century Bank resulted in a slight increase in income from mortgage banking activities. 
 Net gain on securities was 75,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of market adjustments on equity securities. Net loss on securities was 12,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of market adjustments on equity securities. 
 The three months ended September 30, 2023 included a 5.1 million payment to the IRS for the return of ERC, which was received during the second quarter of 2023.

 Other operating income decreased 363,000, or 51.7 , to 339,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 702,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The three months ended September 30, 2023 included a nonrecurring fee and dividend income realized on equity securities. The acquisition of Century Bank resulted in additional other operating income. 
 Noninterest Expense 
 Noninterest expense for th e three months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.7 million compared to 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 5.1 million, or 59.7 , which was primarily attributable to merger-related expenses of 1.5 million as a result of the acquisition of Century Bank and an increase in salaries and employee benefits as result of the acquisition. The three months ended September 30, 2023 included a 1.2 million refund of professional fees related to the aforementioned return of ERC. 
 The following table sets forth the major components of our noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) (dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits 6,876 5,752 1,124 Equipment and occupancy expenses 814 718 96 Professional services 826 581 245 Professional fees related to ERC (1,243) 1,243 Data processing fees 781 650 131 Other real estate expense (income)

This increase was primarily the result of accelerated expense on brokered deposit calls that took place during September 2024, as well as an increase in legal fees as a result of increased expenses associated with a problem loan. These increases were partially offset by decreases in third-party expenses on interest rate swaps and servicing expenses on SBA/USDA loans. 
 The three months ended September 30, 2023 included a 1.2 million refund of professional fees related to the aforementioned return of ERC. 
 Data processing fees, which primarily consists of data processing services for core processing from a third-party vendor, increased 131,000, or 20.2 , to 781,000 for t he three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 650,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase was primarily due to minor OREO expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The three months ended September 30, 2023 included rental income related to a property sold in December 2023, which offset the expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other operating expenses increased 658,000, or 30.8 , to 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 .

The increase in net interest income was comprised of a 28.7 million, or 29.9 , increase in interest income, partially offset by a 21.8 million or 59.8 , increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was substantially the result of a 337.0 million, or 20.1 , increase in average loans outstanding from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024, coupled with a 0.53 increase in average loan yield as higher rate loans were recorded from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The increase in average loans outstanding was due to growth, partially as a result of the Century Bank acquisition. The 21.8 million increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase of 370.7 million, or 24.4 , in average interest-bearing liabilities from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024, coupled with a 0.91 increase in the cost paid on interest-bearing liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was due to growth, partially as a result of the Century Bank acquisition. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.60 and 2.63 , respectively, compared to 3.85 and 3.00 , respectively, for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 2023 
 Increase (Decrease) (dollars in thousands) Service charges on deposit accounts 1,458 1,348 110 Swa p fees 
 10 622 (612) SBA/USDA fees 302 274 28 Bank card services and interchange fees 1,358 1,160 198 Mortgage banking activities 300 446 (146) Net gain on secur ities 
 83 457 (374) Other operating income (1) 
 882 1,448 (566) Total noninterest income 4,393 5,755 (1,362) 
 (1) Other income and fees include income and fees associated with miscellaneous services and the increase in the cash surrender value of BOLI. 
 Income from service charges on deposit accounts includes fees for overdraft charges, insufficient funds charges, account analysis service fees on commercial accounts, and monthly account service fees. These fees increased 110,000, or 8.2 , to 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to additional overall income as a result of the acquisition of Century Bank. 
 Interest rate swap fees represent fees received when the Bank s customer enters into a back-to-back swap agreement and fair value adjustments. These fees decreased 612,000, or 98.4 , to 10,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 622,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Bank did not participate in interest rate swaps during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, but did realize a net fair value adjustment as income. 
 SBA/USDA fees primarily include gains on the sale of loans and servicing of the loans. These fees increased 28,000, or 10.2 , to 302,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 274,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to additional gains on the sales of loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was partially offset by a reduction in servicing income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Bank card services and interchange fees are derived from debit cards and foreign ATM transactions. These fees increased 198,000, or 17.1 , to 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to more transactional volume, partially as a result of the acquisition of Century Bank, that generated an increase in fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income from mortgage banking activities primarily includes origination fees and gains on the sale of mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Income from mortgage banking activities decreased 146,000, or 32.7 , to 300,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 446,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was the result of decreased volumes in the secondary market primarily based on reduced mortgage demand from increased interest rates. The acquisition of Century Bank resulted in a slight increase in income from mortgage banking activities. 
 Net gain on securities was 83,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of market adjustments on equity securities. Net gain on securities was 457,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, substantially as a result of market adjustments on equity securities. 

55 

Other operating income decreased 566,000, or 39.1 , to 882,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in nonrecurring income from third-parties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in BOLI income, resulting from the purchase of additional BOLI insurance and from the acquisition of Century Bank. 
 Noninterest Expense 
 Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 35.5 million compared to 32.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , an increase of 3.3 million, or 10.3 , which primarily resulted from an increase in other operating expenses and merger-related expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The following table sets forth the major components of our noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 2023 
 Increase (Decrease) (dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits 19,219 19,926 (707) Equipment and occupancy expenses 2,170 2,095 75 Professional services 1,919 1,606 313 Data processing fees 2,110 1,889 221 Other real estate expense (income) 
 93 (107) 200 Merger-related expenses 1,511 1,511 Other operating expenses (1) 
 8,451 6,750 1,701 Total noninterest expense 35,473 32,159 3,314 
 (1) Other operating expenses include items such as FDIC insurance, telephone expenses, marketing and advertising expense, debit card expenses, courier fees, directors fees, travel and entertainment expenses, insurance, fraud and forgery losses, uninsured deposit program expenses, tax credit investment expenses and provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments. 
 Salaries and employee benefits primarily include: (i) amounts paid to employees for base pay, incentive compensation, and bonuses; (ii) health and other related insurance paid by the Bank on behalf of our employees; and (iii) retirement plans provided for employees, including the 401(k) and non-qualified plans maintained for certain key employees. Salaries and employee benefits decreased 707,000 million, or 3.5 , from 19.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 19.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was substantially the result of one-time retirement-related expenses of 1.6 million paid to our former CEO in May 2023 and reductions in expenses associated with restricted stock units and incentives resulting from retirements. These decreases were partially offset by an overall increase in salaries and employee benefits, notably related to our supplemental executive retirement plan SERP ), as a result of additional participation, primarily due to the acquisition of Century Bank. 
 Equipment and occupancy expenses consist of depreciation on property, premises, equipment and software, rent expense for leased facilities, maintenance agreements on equipment, property taxes, and other expenses related to maintaining owned or leased assets. Equipment and occupancy expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.2 million compared to 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 75,000, or 3.6 . The increase was primarily due to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as a result of the acquisition of Century Bank, along with additional leasing expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Professional services expenses, which include legal fees, audit and accounting fees, and consulting fees, increased 313,000, or 19.5 , to 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in placement fees associated with utilizing additional brokered deposits during 2024 and acceleration of expenses on brokered deposit calls that took place 
 56 

during September 2024. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in third-party expenses incurred on interest rate swaps. 
 Data processing fees, which primarily consists of data processing services for core processing from a third-party vendor, increased 221,000, or 11.7 , to 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of additional software and general increases, partially as a result of the acquisition of Century Bank. 
 Other real es tate expense (income) increased 200,000, or 186.9 , to a ne t expense of 93,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , from a net income of 107,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 included rental income related to a property sold in December 2023, while the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected an increase in OREO expenses compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other operating expenses increased 1.7 million, or 25.2 , to 8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was substantially due to a 1.2 million wire fraud loss incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was not a systematic issue, only a procedural incident, along with an increase in FDIC insurance and regulatory assessments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The acquisition of Century Bank resulted in additional overall other operating expenses, most of which was core deposit intangible amortization. 
 
 Financial Condition 
 Total assets grew 394.8 million, or 16.1 , to 2.8 billion at September 30, 2024 from 2.4 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 Loans, net of unearned income, increased 314.7 million, or 16.7 , to 2.2 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.9 billion at December 31, 2023. Loans, net of unearned income, grew at an annualized rate of 22.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Securities portfolio increased 19.1 million, or 9.6 , to 217.7 million at September 30, 2024 , compared to 198.6 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Cash and cash equivalents grew 27.2 million, or 10.9 , to 277.9 million at September 30, 2024 , from 250.7 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Deposits grew 402.4 million, or 19.9 , to 2.4 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The majority of the growth was due to an increase of 294.0 million in interest-bearing deposits, coupled with a 108.3 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. Included in the increase was 36.7 million in brokered deposits. Total deposits, excluding brokered deposits, grew at an annualized rate of 32.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Total stockholders equity increased 56.4 million, or 26.2 , to 271.4 million at September 30, 2024 , compared to 215.0 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was s ubstantially due to the issuance of 31.5 million in common stock for the acquisition of Century Bank, along with earnings growth. 
 Loan Portfolio 
 Loans represent the largest portion of earning assets, greater than the securities portfolio or any other asset category, and the quality and diversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when reviewing the Company s financial condition. 
 The Company originates residential real estate loans for the secondary market. The Company sells the residential real estate loans exclusively to two private investors who solely and independently make the credit decisions and set the closing conditions. The loans are closed in the Company s name but are immediately assigned to the designated investor. These loans have an average turn time to purchase of 30 days or less. These mortgage loans are designated on the Company s balance sheet as held for sale. This segment represents less than 0.021 of total loans based on the latest thirteen-month average. 
 57 

We have three loan portfolio segments: real estate RE which is divided into three classes, commercial and industrial C I ), and consumer and other. A class is generally determined based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristic of the loan, and method for monitoring and assessing credit risk. Classes within the RE portfolio segment include construction and development or C D ), residential mortgages, and commercial mortgages. 
 Our loan clients primarily consist of small to medium sized business, the owners and operators of these businesses, as well as other professionals, entrepreneurs and high net worth individuals. We believe owner-occupied and investment commercial real estate loans, residential construction loans and commercial business loans provide us with higher risk-adjusted returns, shorter maturities and more sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, and are complemented by our relatively lower risk residential real estate loans to individuals. 
 The following describes risk characteristics relevant to each of the loan portfolio segments: 
 Real estate The Company offers various types of real estate loan products, which are divided into the classes described below. All loans within this portfolio segment are particularly sensitive to the valuation of real estate: 
 Construction and development, or C D, loans include extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of the real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. 
 Residential mortgages include 1-4 family first mortgage loans, which are repaid by various means such as a borrower s income, sale of the property, or rental income derived from the property. These include second liens or open-end residential real estate loans, such as home equity lines. These loans are typically repaid by the same means as 1-4 family first mortgages. 
 Commercial mortgages include both owner-occupied commercial real estate loans and other commercial real estate loans, such as commercial loans secured by income producing properties. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans made to operating businesses are long-term financing of land and buildings and are repaid by cash flows generated from business operations. Real estate loans for income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers are repaid from rent income derived from the properties. 
 Commercial and industrial This loan portfolio segment includes loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, leases, or expansion projects. Loans are repaid by business cash flows. Collection risk in this portfolio is driven by the creditworthiness of the underlying borrower, particularly cash flows from the borrowers business operations. 
 Consumer and other This loan portfolio segment includes direct consumer installment loans, overdrafts and other revolving credit loans. Loans in this portfolio are sensitive to unemployment and other key consumer economic measures. 
 The following table presents the balance and associated percentage of the composition of loans, excluding loans held for sale on the dates indicated: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amount of Total Amount of Total (dollars in thousands) Real estate mortgages: Construction and development 245,275 11.1 242,960 12.9 Residential 293,150 13.3 224,603 11.9 Commercial 1,344,554 61.0 1,144,867 60.5 Commercial and industrial 310,540 14.1 269,961 14.3 Consumer and other 12,228 0.5 8,286 0.4 Gross Loans 2,205,747 100.0 1,890,677 100.0 Deferred loan fees (6,536) (6,169) Allowance for credit losses (28,061) (24,378) Loans, net 2,171,150 1,860,130 
 58 

Gross loans increased 315.1 million, or 16.7 , to 2.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. Portfolio segments and classes remained relatively consistent since December 31, 2023. 
 The majority of our fixed rate loans have a one to five-year maturity. This type of loan has historically been approximately 50 of total loans over the past three years because the majority of our commercial loans are priced with five-year balloons. 
 We are primarily involved in real estate and commercial lending activities with customers throughout our markets in Alabama and Georgia. About 85.4 of our gross loans were secured by real property as of September 30, 2024 , compared to 85.3 as of December 31, 2023. We believe that these loans are not concentrated in any one single property type and that they are geographically dispersed throughout our markets. Our debtors ability to repay their loans is substantially dependent upon the economic conditions of the markets in which we operate, which consist primarily of wholesale/retail and related businesses. 
 Commercial real estate loans were 61.0 of total gross loans as of September 30, 2024 and represented 60.5 of total gross loans as of December 31, 2023. C D loans were 11.1 of total gross loans as of September 30, 2024 , and represented 12.9 of total gross loans as of December 31, 2023. The regulatory concentration ratio of the Company s commercial real estate loans to total risk-based Bank capital is 295.7 as of September 30, 2024 and 296.8 as of December 31, 2023. C D loans represented 71.3 of total risk-based Bank capital as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 80.9 as of December 31, 2023. The regulatory concentration ratios of commercial real estate loans and construction and development loans to total risk-based capital as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were each below the 300 /100 concentration guidelines provided by regulators. Further, these loans are geographically diversified, primarily throughout our markets in Alabama and Georgia. 
 The Company has established concentration limits in its loan portfolio for commercial real estate loans by loan types, including collateral and industry, among others. The sector concentration is actively managed by the Senior Management team, including the Chief Executive Officer and President, Chief Risk/Credit Officer and Ch ief Financial Officer. 
 The Company requires all business purpose loans to be underwritten by a centralized underwriting department located in Birmingham, Alabama. Industry-tested underwriting guidelines are used to assess a borrower s historical cash flow to determine debt service, and the Company further stress tests the debt service under higher interest rate scenarios. Financial and performance covenants are used in commercial lending to allow us to react to a borrower s deteriorating financial condition, should that occur. 
 Construction and Development . Loans for residential construction are for single-family properties to developers or investors. These loans are underwritten based on estimates of costs and the completed value of the project. Funds are advanced based on estimated percentage of completion for the project. Performance of these loans is affected by economic conditions as well as the ability to control the costs of the projects. This category also includes commercial construction projects. 
 Construction and development loans increased 2.3 million, or 1.0 , to 245.3 million as of September 30, 2024 from 243.0 million as o f December 31, 2023. The majority of this increase was primarily due loans acquired from the acquisition of Century Bank. 
 Residential . We offer one-to-four family mortgage loans on both owner-occupied primary residences and investor-owned residences, which make up 54.1 of our residential loan portfolio. Our residential loans also include home equity lines of credit, which total 26.3 million, or 8.9 of our residential portfolio as of September 30, 2024 . By offering a full line of residential loan products, the owners of the small to medium sized businesses that we lend to use us, instead of a competitor, for financing a personal residence. We also offer multi-family loans, which comprise 36.5 of the portfolio. Other residential loans make up the remaining 0.5 of the portfolio. 
 Residential multi-family loans increased 68.5 million, or 30.5 , to 293.2 million as of September 30, 2024 from 224.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The majority of this increase was due to loans acquired from the acquisition of Century Bank, and to a lesser extent, loan growth in the Company s Atlanta, Georgia market. 
 Commercial Real Estate . The Company s commercial real estate loan portfolio include s loans for commercial property that is owned by real estate investors, construction loans to build owner-occupied properties, and loans to developers of commercial real estate investment properties and residential developments. Commercial real estate loans are subject to 
 59 

underwriting standards and processes similar to the Company s commercial loans. These loans are underwritten primarily based on projected cash flows for income-producing properties and collateral values for non-income-producing properties. The repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loans or the sale or refinancing of the property. Real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the Company s real estate portfolio are diversified by type and geographic location. The Company believes the diversity helps reduce the exposure to adverse economic events that may affect any single market or industry. 
 Commercial real estate loans increased 199.7 million, or 17.4 , to 1.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase in commer cial real estate loans during this period was mostly driven by general increases in lending activity, primarily in the Company s Atlanta/Columbus, Georgia markets. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company s commercial real estate portfolio was comprised of 663.9 million in non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans and 109.9 million in commercial construction loans. 
 Commercial and Industrial . Commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably. Underwriting standards have been designed to determine whether the borrower possesses sound business ethics and practices, to evaluate current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations, and to ensure appropriate collateral is obtained to secure the loan. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and, secondarily, on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as real estate, accounts receivable, or inventory, and typically include personal guarantees. Owner-occupied real estate is included in commercial and industrial loans, as the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the operations of the commercial borrower s business rather than on income-producing properties or the sale of the properties. 
 Commercial and industrial loans increased 40.6 million, or 15.0 to 310.5 million as of September 30, 2024 from 270.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The majority of this increase was due to loan growth primarily in the Company s Georgia and Opelika, Alabama markets, coupled with loans acquired from the acquisition of Century Bank. 
 Consumer and Other . The Company utilizes the central underwriting department for all consumer loans over 200,000 in total credit exposure regardless of collateral type. Loans below this threshold are underwritten by the responsible loan officer in accordance with the Company s consumer loan policy. The loan policy addresses types of consumer loans that may be originated and the requisite collateral, if any, which must be perfected. We believe the relatively smaller individual dollar amounts of consumer loans that are spread over numerous individual borrowers minimize risk. 
 Consumer and other loans (non-real estate loans) increased 3.9 million or 47.6 , to 12.2 million as of September 30, 2024 from 8.3 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Loan Participations 
 In the normal course of business, the Company periodically sells participating interests in loans to other banks and investors. All participations are sold on a proportionate (pro-rata) basis with all cash flows divided proportionately among the participants and no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset without the consent of all the participants. Other than standard 90-day prepayment provisions and standard representations and warranties, participating interests are sold without recourse. We also purchase loan participations from time to time. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, loan participations sold to third parties (which are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets) totaled 164.2 million and 127.8 million, respectively. We sell participations to manage our credit exposures to borrowers and concentration guidelines. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we purchased loan participations totaling 133.2 million and 121.8 million, respectively. The variances come from purchases and sales of participations in the ordinary course of business. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 As described previously under Recent Accounting Pronouncements, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments CECL effective January 1, 2023. 
 60 

For loans the allowance for credit losses is based on the Company s evaluation of the loan portfolio, past loan loss experience, current asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay (including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The process is inherently subjective and subject to significant change as it requires material estimates. The allowance is increased by a provision for credit losses, which is charged to expense, and reduced by charge offs, net of recoveries. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. 
 Loans with similar risk characteristics are evaluated in pools and, depending on the nature of each identified pool, the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow, probability of default / loss given default, or remaining life method. The historical loss experience estimate by pool is then adjusted by forecast factors that are quantitatively related to the Company s historical credit loss experience, such as national unemployment rates and gross domestic product. Losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages. The reasonable and supportable period and reversion period are re-evaluated each quarter by the Company and are dependent on the current economic environment among other factors. 
 The estimated credit losses for each loan pool are then adjusted for changes in qualitative factors not inherently considered in the quantitative analyses. The qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation. The Company considers factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework which include the following: changes in lending policies and quality of loan reviews, changes in nature and volume of loans, changes in volume and trends of problem loans, changes in concentration risk, trends in underlying collateral values, changes in competition, legal and regulatory environment and changes in economic conditions. 
 Credit losses for loans that no longer share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools are excluded from the collective evaluation and estimated on an individual basis. Specific allowances are estimated based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows. 
 The Company measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan, adjusted for estimated prepayments. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless there is a reasonable expectation that a loan modification will be executed. Credit losses are estimated on the amortized cost basis of loans. Accrued interest receivable on loans is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 
 
 Credit Exposure 
 The Company also has off-balance sheet financial instruments, which include unfunded credit commitments and letters of credit. The Company minimizes these risks through underwriting guidelines and prudent risk management techniques. For off-balance sheet instruments, the allowance for credit losses is calculated in accordance with Topic 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit and considers the probability of a drawdown on the commitment and other factors. The allowance is reported as a component of other liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments are reported in the income statement as a component of other operating expense. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet financial instruments was 1.4 million and 1.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The allowance for credit losse s was 28.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 24.4 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 3.7 million, or 15.1 . Additional provisions were recorded based on overall growth in loans and increases for qualitative economic factors and individually analyzed loans. 
 61 

The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for credit losses as of the dates indicated.

 Nonperforming Loans 
 Loans are considered delinquent when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more. Delinquent loans may remain on accrual status between 30 days and 90 days past due. Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans. Typically, the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or when, in the opinion of management, there is a reasonable doubt as to collectability in the normal course of business. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income. Income on nonaccrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the loan s principal balance is deemed collectible. Loans are restored to accrual status when loans become well-secured and management believes full collectability of principal and interest is probable. 
 Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. Depending on a particular loan s circumstances, the Company measures impairment of a loan based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent. A loan is considered collateral dependent when repayment of the loan is based solely on the liquidation of the collateral. Fair value, where possible, is determined by independent appraisals, typically on an annual basis. Between appraisal periods, the fair value may be adjusted based on specific events, such as if deterioration of quality of the collateral comes to the Company s attention as part of its problem loan monitoring process, or if discussions with the borrower lead us to believe the last appraised value no longer reflects the actual market for the collateral. The impairment amount on a collateral-dependent loan is charged off to the allowance if deemed not collectible and the impairment amount on a loan that is not collateral-dependent is set up as a specific reserve. 
 Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs. Any write-down to fair value at the time of transfer to other real estate owned is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Costs of improvements are capitalized, whereas costs related to holding other real estate owned and subsequent write-downs to the value are expensed. Any gains and losses realized at the time of disposal are reflected in income. 
 Real estate, which the Company acquires as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, is classified as foreclose d assets until sold and is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new carrying value. Foreclosed assets totaled 33,000 at September 30, 2024 consisting of one property, located in Wedowee, Alabama. 
 Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans plus OREO and collateral taken in foreclosure or similar proceedings. 
 Tota l nonperforming loans increased 6.7 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The net increase was primarily attributable to one significant commercial and industrial loan, one less significant commercial and industrial loan and one significant commercial real estate loan being placed on nonaccrual status.

Securities Portfolio 
 The securities portfolio serves the following purposes: (i) it provides liquidity to supplement cash flows from the loan and deposit activities of customers; (ii) it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool since it provides a large base of assets and the Company can change the maturity and interest rate characteristics more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other Company funding sources; (iii) it is an alternative interest-earning asset when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans; and (iv) it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds, as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender. 
 The securities portfolio consists of securities classified as available for sale and held to maturity. All available for sale securities are reported at fair value. Securities available for sale consist primarily of state and municipal securities and mortgage-backed securities. All held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost. Securities held to maturity consist of state and municipal securities. We determine the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.

The following table summarizes the fair value of the securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 Certain securities have fair values less than amortized cost and, therefore, contain unrealized losses. At September 30, 2024 , we evaluated the securities that had an unrealized loss for credit impairment and determined all declines in value to be temporary. We anticipate full recovery of amortized cost with respect to these securities by maturity, or sooner in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment. We do not intend to sell these securities and it is not probable that we will be required to sell them before recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. 
 The following tables set forth certain information regarding contractual maturities and the weighted average yields of our investment securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Weighted average yield is calculated by taking the sum of each category of securities multiplied by the respective yield for a given maturity, and dividing by the sum of the securities for the same maturity. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

 Bank Owned Life Insurance 
 We maintain investments in BOLI policies to help control employee benefit costs, as a protection against loss of certain key emp loyees and as a tax planning strategy. We are the sole owner and beneficiary of the BOLI policies. At September 30, 2024 , BOLI totaled 39.2 million compared to 29.9 million at December 31, 2023. The increase represents additional insurance of 8.6 million, of which 5.9 million is a result of the acquisition of Century Bank, and an increase in the cash surrender value. 
 Deposits 
 Deposits represent the Company s primary and most vital source of funds. We offer a variety of deposit products including demand deposits accounts, interest-bearing products, savings accounts and certificate of deposits. The Bank also acquires brokered deposits, QwickRate internet certificates of deposit, and reciprocal deposits through the IntraFi network. The reciprocal deposits include both the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS and Insured Cash Sweep 
 66 

program. The Company is a member of the IntraFi network, which effectively allows depositors to receive FDIC insurance on amounts greater than the FDIC insurance limit, which is currently 250,000. IntraFi allows institutions to break large deposits into smaller amounts and place them in a network of other IntraFi institutions to ensure full FDIC insurance is gained on the entire deposit. Generally, internet and reciprocal deposits are not brokered deposits for regulatory purposes. 
 Our strong asset growth requires us to place a greater emphasis on both interest and noninterest-bearing deposits. Deposit accounts are added by loan production cross-selling, customer referrals, marketing advertisements, mobile and online banking and our involvement within our communities. 
 Total deposits at September 30, 2024 were 2.4 billion, representing an increase of 402.4 million, or 19.9 , compared to 2.0 billion at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 , 22.5 of total deposits were comprised of noninterest-bearing demand accounts, 48.7 of interest-bearing non-maturity accounts and 28.8 of time deposits. Brokered deposits represented 8.0 of total deposits. 
 The following table summarizes our deposit balances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 Time deposits issued in amounts of more than 250,000 represent the type of deposit most likely to affect the Company s future earnings because of interest rate sensitivity. The effective cost of these funds is generally higher than other time deposits because the funds are usually obtained at premium rates of interest. 
 The following table presents the average balance and average rate paid on each of the following deposit categories as of September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Our uninsured deposits, which are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of 250,000, were 735.7 million and 615.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Borrowed Funds 
 In addition to deposits, we utilize advances from the FHLB and other borrowings as a supplementary funding source to finance our operations. 
 FHLB Advances . The FHLB allows us to borrow, on both short and long-term, collateralized by a blanket floating lien on first mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans as well as FHLB stock. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had borrowing capacity from the FHLB of 120.4 million and 162.7 million, respectively. We had 22.0 million in FHLB borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and 70.0 million as of December 31, 2023. All our outstanding FHLB advances have fixed rates of interest. 
 68 

The following table sets forth our FHLB borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Amount outstanding at end of period 22,000 70,000 Weighted average interest rate at end of period 5.34 5.02 Maximum month-end balance 55,000 70,000 Average balance outstanding during the period 45,839 39,830 Weighted average interest rate during the period 4.97 4.64 
 Lines of Credit . The Bank has uncollateralized, uncommitted federal funds lines of credit with multiple banks as a source of funding for liquidity management. The total amount of the lines of credit was 114.2 million and 99.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectivel y, of which 0 and 10.0 million was outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There was 114.2 million and 89.2 million available as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window. The Bank has the ability to borrow funds from the Federal Reserve Bank utilizing the discount window, as an instrument that allows us to borrow on a short-term basis to meet temporary liquidity needs. The Bank had borrowing capacity of 286.0 million and 295.7 million as a source of funding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which 0 and 10.0 million was outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There was 286.0 million and 285.7 million available as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program BTFP . O n March 12, 2023, the Federal Reserve Bank, Department of Treasury and the FDIC issued a joint statement outlining actions taken to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in the banking system as a result of and in response to recently announced bank closures. Among other actions, the Federal Reserve Board announced that it would make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions through the creation of a new BTFP. The BTFP provides eligible depository institutions an additional source of liquidity. On March 11, 2024, BTFP ended and ceased providing new loans, and, as a result, the Bank has no more borrowing capacity or availability to borrow, but had 8.0 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024 . The Bank had borrowing capacity of 11.3 million as a source of funding as of December 31, 2023, of which 7.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2023 . There was 4.3 million available as of December 31, 2023. 
 First Horizon Line of Credit . During 2019, the Company obtained the 25.0 million Line of Credit with First Horizon, which was extended in August 2024 and matures in August 2026. The Line of Credit is collateralized by 100 of the capital stock of the Bank. The Line of Credit includes various financial and nonfinancial covenants. The Line of Credit has a variable interest rate linked to the WSJ Prime Rate with an initial interest rate of 4.75 per annum (but in no event less than 3.00 per annum), and requires quarterly interest payments. The balance outstanding under the Line of Credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 0. 
 Subordinated Debt Securities 
 On February 7, 2022, the Company issued 48.0 million of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due February 2032 (the Notes ). The Notes bear interest at 3.50 per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. From and including February 7, 2027, to but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to a Three-Month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 205 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. The Company will be entitled to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on any interest payment on or after February 7, 2027, and to redeem the Notes in whole upon certain other events. On September 19, 2024, the Company redeemed 500,000 of the Notes held by Century Bank in connection with the acquisition, resulting in a principal amount 47.5 million at September 30, 2024. 
 On October 26, 2022, the Company issued 40.0 million of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due October 2032 (the 2032 Notes ). The 2032 Notes bear interest at 7.00 per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. From and including October 26, 2027, to but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to a Three-Month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 306 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. The Company 
 69 

will be entitled to redeem the 2032 Notes, in whole or in part, on any interest payment on or after October 26, 2027, and to redeem the 2032 Notes in whole upon certain other events. 
 On July 31, 2024, the Company assumed Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due December 2031 from the acquisition of Century Bank (the Century Notes in an aggregate principal amount, net of premium adjustments, of 4.7 million. The Century Notes will mature on December 22, 2031, and through December 22, 2026 will bear a fixed rate of interest of 3.50 per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. From and including December 22, 2026, to but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest will reset quarterly to a floating rate per annum equal to the then current Three-Month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 242 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity refers to the measure of our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. 
 Interest rate sensitivity involves the relationships between rate-sensitive assets and liabilities and is an indication of the probable effects of interest rate fluctuations on the Company s net interest income. Interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are those with yields or rates that are subject to change within a future time period due to maturity or changes in market rates. A model is used to project future net interest income under a set of possible interest rate movements. The Company s Asset Liability Committee, or ALCO, reviews this information to determine if the projected future net interest income levels would be acceptable. The Company attempts to stay within acceptable net interest income levels. 
 Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and access to alternative sources of funds. Our liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in correspondent banks, federal funds sold, and the fair value of unpledged investment securi ties. Other available sources of liquidity include wholesale deposits, and additional borrowings from correspondent banks, FHLB advances, federal reserve bank borrowings and the Line of Credit. 
 Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily met through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan and investment portfolios, and increases in customer deposits. Other alternative sources of funds will supplement these primary sources to the extent necessary to meet additional liquidity requirements on either a short-term or long-term basis. 
 The Company and the Bank are separate corporate entities. The Company s liquidity depends primarily upon dividends received from the Bank and capital and debt issued by the Company. The Company relies on its liquidity to pay interest and principal on Company indebtedness, company operating expenses, and dividends to Company shareholders. 
 During the first quarter of 2023, numerous regional banks encountered liquidity stresses and the failure of a few high-profile financial institutions created stress in the banking sector. These institutions appeared to face stress particularly surrounding uninsured deposits. Our percentage of deposits that were uninsured as of September 30, 2024 , was 30.4 . We believe this percentage would place the Company s level of uninsured deposits below peer average and peer median. We attribute this lower level of uninsured deposits to having a deposit base with less concentrated deposits than those of the institutions that failed, especially when considering our commercial banking focus. This is due primarily to our focus on banking small businesses that allows us to accumulate larger quantities of insured commercial accounts than a bank that is focused on larger clients. In addition, the Company also utilizes an uninsured deposit program. 
 Capital Requirements 
 We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking regulators. Failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (described below), we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated 
 70 

under regulatory accounting policies. The capital amounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by the federal banking regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , both the Company and the Bank exceeded all the minimum bank regulatory capital requirements to which the Company and the Bank were subject. 
 The table below summarizes the minimum capital requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank from a regulatory perspective, as well as the Company s and the Bank s capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Basel III capital guidelines require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total capital, Tier 1 capital, and common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. In addition, under Basel III, the Bank is subject to a capital conservation buffer, which requires it to maintain common equity Tier 1 capital of 2.50 above minimum capital requirements for the common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 risk-based ratio and total risk-based ratio to avoid limitations on distributions and discretionary bonus payments. 
 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires, among other things, that the federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action with respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet certain minimum capital requirements. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act s prompt corrective action regime, insured depository institutions are divided into five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. A depository institution is defined to be well capitalized if it has a common equity tier 1 capital ratio CET1 capital of at least 6.5 , a leverage ratio of at least 5 , a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8 , and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10 , and it is not subject to a directive, order or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. Bank holding companies are not suspect to prompt corrective action. 
 The Company and the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under Basel III and the Bank met all the minimum capital adequacy requirements to be considered well capitalized for prompt corrective action purposes as of the dates reflected in the table below. As a bank holding company with less than 3.0 billion in total consolidated assets, the Company is eligible to be treated as a small bank holding company under the Federal Reserve s Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement. As a result, the Company s capital adequacy is evaluated at the bank level and on a parent-only basis, and it is not subject to consolidated capital standards for regulatory purposes. The ratios set forth below as to the Company are for illustrative purposes in the event the Company were to become subject to consolidated capital standards for regulatory purposes. The column styled Required for Capital Adequacy Purposes includes the 2.50 capital conservation buffer.

Contractual Obligations 
 The following tables contain supplemental information regarding our total contractual obligations at September 30, 2024 . 
 Payments Due as of September 30, 2024 
 Within One Year One to Five Years After Five Years Total (dollars in thousands) Time deposits 644,704 51,262 27 695,993 FHLB advances 22,000 22,000 Subordinated notes (286) 91,393 91,107 Other borrowings 8,000 (24) 7,976 Total contractual obligations 674,704 50,952 91,420 817,076 
 We believe that we will be able to meet our contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. We expect to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. We have in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to our customers is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the Company until the instrument is exercised. The contractual or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as they do for on-balance sheet instruments. The amount and nature of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the potential borrower. 
 Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private short-term borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. 
 The following table summarizes commitments we have made as of the dates presented. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Commitments to extend credit 352,503 501,935 Standby letters of credit 6,152 2,846 Total 358,655 504,781

Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk 
 As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our interest rate risk policy provides management with the guidelines for effective funds management, and we have established a measurement system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. We have historically managed our sensitivity position within our established guidelines. 
 Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those that have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. 
 We manage our exposure to interest rates by adjusting our balance sheet assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by ALCO in accordance with policies approved by the Bank s board of directors. ALCO formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, ALCO considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. ALCO meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, ALCO reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. Management also employs methodologies to manage interest rate risk, which include an analysis of the relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analyses. 
 We use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analyses to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on other financial metrics. 
 Contractual maturities and re-pricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the models. The average lives of non-maturity deposit accounts are based on decay assumptions and are incorporated into the models. All of the assumptions used in our analyses are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the models simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies. 
 On a quarterly basis, we run a simulation model for a static balance sheet and other scenarios. These models test the impact on net interest income from changes in market interest rates under various scenarios. Under the static model, rates are shocked instantaneously and ramped rates change over a 12-month and 24-month horizon based upon parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. Non-parallel simulation involves analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the shape of the yield curve. Our internal policy regarding internal rate risk simulations currently specifies that for parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated net interest income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than 10 for a 100 basis point shift, 15 for a 200 basis point shift, 20 for a 300 basis point shift, and 25 for a 400 basis point shift. 
 74 

The following tables summarize the simulated change in net interest income over a 12-month horizon as of the dates indicated: 
 Percent Change in Net Interest Income As of September 30, 2024 
 As of September 30, 2023 
 Change in Interest Rates (Basis Points) +400 5.20 4.30 +300 4.30 3.70 +200 3.10 2.70 +100 1.70 1.50 -100 (2.10) (4.40) -200 (4.80) (7.50) -300 (9.20) (10.80) -400 (15.00) (14.40) 
 Inflation and increases in interest rates may result from fiscal stimulus and monetary stimulus, and the Federal Reserve has indicated it is willing to permit inflation to run moderately above its 2 target for some time. Increases in interest rates have caused consumers to shift their funds to more interest-bearing instruments and to increase the competition for and costs of deposits. Customers movement of bank deposits into other investment assets or from transaction deposits to higher interest-bearing time deposits have caused our funding costs to increase. Additionally, any such loss of funds could result in lower loan originations and growth, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Increases in market interest rates may reduce demand for loans, including residential mortgage loan originations. At the same time, increases in rates will increase the rates we charge on variable rate loans and may increase our net interest margin. Higher interest rates would decrease the values of our existing fixed rate securities investments and could potentially adversely affect the values and liquidity of collateral securing our loans. The effects of increased rates will depend on the rates of changes in our costs of funds and interest earned on our loans and investments and the shape of the yield curve. 
 
 Impact of Inflation 
 The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and conform to general practices within our industry. To prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates, assumptions and judgments based on available information. These estimates, assumptions and judgments affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions and judgments inherent in those policies, are critical to understanding our financial statements. 
 The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that we believe require us to make the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. Additional information about these policies can be found in Note 1 of the Company s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. The allowance for credit losses is based on the Company s evaluation of the loan portfolios, past loan loss experience, current asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse 
 75 

situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay (including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The process is inherently subjective and subject to significant change as it requires material estimates. The allowance is increased by a provision for credit losses, which is charged to expense, and reduced by charge offs, net of recoveries. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. 
 Loans with similar risk characteristics are evaluated in pools and, depending on the nature of each identified pool, the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow, probability of default / loss given default, or remaining life method. The historical loss experience estimate by pool is then adjusted by forecast factors that are quantitatively related to the Company s historical credit loss experience, such as national unemployment rates and gross domestic product. Losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages. The reasonable and supportable period and reversion period are re-evaluated each quarter by the Company and are dependent on the current economic environment among other factors. 
 The estimated credit losses for each loan pool are then adjusted for changes in qualitative factors not inherently considered in the quantitative analyses. The qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation. The Company considers factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework which include the following: changes in lending policies and quality of loan reviews, changes in nature and volume of loans, changes in volume and trends of problem loans, changes in concentration risk, trends in underlying collateral values, changes in competition, legal and regulatory environment and changes in economic conditions. 
 Credit losses for loans that no longer share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools are excluded from the collective evaluation and estimated on an individual basis. Specific allowances are estimated based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows. 
 The Company measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan, adjusted for estimated prepayments. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless there is a reasonable expectation that a troubled debt restructuring will be executed. Credit losses are estimated on the amortized cost basis of loans. Accrued interest receivable on loans is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Securities. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company estimates and recognizes an allowance for credit losses for held to maturity debt securities pursuant to ASU No. 2016-13. The Company has a zero-loss expectation for its held to maturity securities portfolio, except for U.S. State and Municipal securities, and therefore it is not required to estimate an allowance for credit losses related to these securities. For held to maturity securities that do not have a zero-loss expectation, the allowance for credit losses is based on the security s amortized cost, excluding interest receivable, and represents the portion of the amortized cost that the Company does not expect to collect over the life of the security. The allowance for credit losses is determined using average industry credit ratings and historical loss experience, and is initially recognized upon acquisition of the securities, and subsequently remeasured on a recurring basis. The Company evaluates available for sale debt securities that experienced a decline in fair value below amortized cost for credit impairment. In performing an assessment of whether any decline in fair value is due to a credit loss, the Company considers the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost, changes in credit ratings, any adverse economic conditions, as well as all relevant information at the individual security level, such as credit deterioration of the issuer, explicit or implicit guarantees by the federal government or collateral underlying the security. If it is determined that the decline in fair value was due to credit losses, an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The non-credit related decrease in the fair value, such as a decline due to changes in market interest rates, is recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax. The Company recognizes a credit impairment if the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. 
 Valuation of Foreclosed Assets. Foreclosed assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less selling costs. Any write-down to fair value at the time of transfer to foreclosed assets is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Costs of 
 76 

improvements are capitalized, whereas costs relating to holding foreclosed assets and subsequent write-downs to the value are expensed. The valuation of foreclosed assets is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by management for accuracy by taking into consideration periodic independent appraisals adjusted for estimated costs to sell. Because current economic conditions can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the valuation of the Company s foreclosed assets could significantly and quickly change, particularly when updated appraisal valuations are obtained on individual properties.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed by the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
