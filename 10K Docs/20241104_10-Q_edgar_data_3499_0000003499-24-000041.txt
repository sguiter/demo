 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg accounted for revenue of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing approximately of our rental revenues in each period. No other tenant accounted for more than 10 of our rental revenues. If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In order to assist us in our continuing assessment of Bloomberg s creditworthiness, we receive certain confidential financial information and metrics from Bloomberg. In addition, we access and evaluate financial information regarding Bloomberg from other private sources, as well as publicly available data. 
 
 On May 3, 2024, Alexander s and Bloomberg entered into an agreement to extend the leases covering approximately square feet at our 731 Lexington Avenue property that were scheduled to expire in February 2029 for a term of to February 2040. Upon execution of this lease extension, we paid a leasing commission, of which was to a third-party broker and was to Vornado. 
 
 In connection with the lease extension, Bloomberg is entitled to a tenant fund which is accounted for as a lease incentive under GAAP. Accordingly, during the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a deferred lease incentive asset of , which is amortized as a reduction to rental revenues over the remaining term of the lease, and a corresponding liability. These amounts are included in Deferred leasing costs, net and Lease incentive liability, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 
 On December 3, 2022, IKEA closed its square foot store at our Rego Park I property under a lease that was set to expire in December 2030. The lease included a right to terminate effective no earlier than March 16, 2026, subject to payment of rent through the termination date and an additional termination payment equal to the lesser of or the amount of rent due under the remaining term. On September 27, 2023, we entered into a lease modification agreement with IKEA which accelerated its lease termination date to April 1, 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, IKEA paid its remaining rent obligation through March 16, 2026 and the termination payment.

 per occurrence and per property, of which the first includes communicable disease coverage, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage with limits of billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on each of our properties and excluding communicable disease coverage. 
 Fifty Ninth Street Insurance Company, LLC FNSIC ), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological NBCR acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027. Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts) is up to billion per occurrence and in the aggregate. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to FNSIC. For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible for a deductible and of the balance of a covered loss, and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC. 
 We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism or other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material. 
 
 Our loans contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. If lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Alexander s, Inc. 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Alexander s, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and changes in equity, for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the interim financial information ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 12, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report constitute forward-looking statements as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They represent our intentions, plans, expectations and beliefs and are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Our future results, financial condition and business may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as approximates, believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, plans, would, may or other similar expressions in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Many of the factors that will determine the outcome of these and our other forward-looking statements are beyond our ability to control or predict. For a further discussion of factors that could materially affect the outcome of our forward-looking statements, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include a discussion of our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies 
 A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included therein.

 Financing Activity 
 On June 11, 2024, we entered into a four-month extension of the 500,000,000 interest-only mortgage loan on the office condominium of our 731 Lexington Avenue property and simultaneously paid down the principal balance by 10,000,000 to 490,000,000. 
 On September 30, 2024, we entered into a new 400,000,000 mortgage loan on the office condominium portion of 731 Lexington Avenue. The interest-only loan has a fixed rate of 5.04 and matures in October 2028. The loan is prepayable, at the Company s option, with no penalty, beginning in October 2026. The new loan replaces the previous 490,000,000 loan that bore interest at the Prime Rate and was scheduled to mature in October 2024. 
 Real Estate Sale 
 On May 19, 2023, we sold the Rego Park III land parcel in Queens, New York, for 71,060,000 inclusive of consideration for Brownfield tax benefits and reimbursement of costs for plans, specifications and improvements to date. Net proceeds from the sale were 67,821,000 after closing costs and the financial statement gain was 53,952,000.

Overview - continued 
 Square Footage, Occupancy and Leasing Activity 
 Our portfolio is comprised of five properties aggregating 2,456,000 square feet. As of September 30, 2024, the commercial occupancy rate was 92.1 and the residential occupancy rate was 96.5 . 
 On December 3, 2022, IKEA closed its 112,000 square foot store at our Rego Park I property under a lease that was set to expire in December 2030. The lease included a right to terminate effective no earlier than March 16, 2026, subject to payment of rent through the termination date and an additional termination payment equal to the lesser of 10,000,000 or the amount of rent due under the remaining term. On September 27, 2023, we entered into a lease modification agreement with IKEA which accelerated its lease termination date to April 1, 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, IKEA paid its remaining rent obligation through March 16, 2026 and the 10,000,000 termination payment. 
 Significant Tenant 
 
 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg accounted for revenue of 93,179,000 and 89,863,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing approximately 55 of our rental revenues in each period. No other tenant accounted for more than 10 of our rental revenues. If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In order to assist us in our continuing assessment of Bloomberg s creditworthiness, we receive certain confidential financial information and metrics from Bloomberg. In addition, we access and evaluate financial information regarding Bloomberg from other private sources, as well as publicly available data. 
 
 On May 3, 2024, Alexander s and Bloomberg entered into an agreement to extend the leases covering approximately 947,000 square feet at our 731 Lexington Avenue property that were scheduled to expire in February 2029 for a term of eleven years to February 2040.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flows 
 Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, debt service, leasing commissions, dividends to stockholders as well as development costs. The sources of liquidity to fund these cash requirements include rental revenue, which is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties, as well as our existing cash, proceeds from financings, including mortgage or construction loans secured by our properties and proceeds from asset sales. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 397,176,000 of liquidity comprised of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Recent increases in interest rates and inflation could adversely affect our cash flow from continuing operations but we anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months, together with existing cash balances, will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash dividends to stockholders, debt service and capital expenditures. We may refinance our maturing debt as it comes due or choose to pay it down. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available to refinance our debt, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to us. 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were 397,176,000 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 552,977,000 as of December 31, 2023, a decr ease of 155,801,000 . This decrease resulted from (i) 175,824,000 of net cash used in financing activities and (ii) 3,273,000 of net cash used in investing activities, partially offset by (iii) 23,296,000 of net cash provided by operating activities.

 Net cash used in investing activities of 3,273,000 was comprised of 9,836,000 of construction in progress and real estate additions, partially offset by proceeds from an interest rate cap of 6,563,000. 
 Net cash provided by operating activit ies of 23,296,000 was comprised of (i) net income of 31,167,000 and (ii) adjustments for non-cash items of 45,349,000, partially offset by (iii) the net change in operating assets and liabilities of 53,220,000 .

 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were 529,081,000 as of September 30, 2023, compared to 214,478,000 as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 314,603,000. This increase resulted from (i) 319,537,000 of net cash provided by investing activities and (ii) 64,367,000 of net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by (iii) 69,301,000 of net cash used in financing activities.

 Net cash provided by operating activities of 64,367,000 was comprised of (i) net income of 86,127,000, partially offset by (ii) the net change in operating assets and liabilities of 4,322,000 and (iii) adjustments for non-cash items of 17,438,000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources - continued 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 Insurance 
 We maintain general liability insurance with limits of 300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, of which the first 30,000,000 includes communicable disease coverage, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage with limits of 1.7 billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on each of our properties and excluding communicable disease coverage. 
 Fifty Ninth Street Insurance Company, LLC FNSIC ), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological NBCR acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027. Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts) is up to 1.7 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to FNSIC. For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible for a 316,000 deductible and 20 of the balance of a covered loss, and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 80 of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC. 
 We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism or other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material. 
 
 Our loans contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. If lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties. 
 Letters of Credit 
 Approximately 900,000 of standby letters of credit were issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 Other 
 There are various legal actions brought against us from time-to-time in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, the outcome of such pending matters in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Funds from Operations FFO (non-GAAP) 
 
 FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of certain real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. A reconciliation of our net income to FFO is provided below. 
 FFO (non-GAAP) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 FFO (non-GAAP) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 14,582,000, or 2.84 per diluted share, compared to 18,623,000, or 3.63 per diluted share in the prior year s three months. 
 FFO (non-GAAP) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 57,123,000, or 11.13 per diluted share, compared to 55,464,000, or 10.81 per diluted share in the prior year s nine months. 
 The following table reconciles our net income to FFO (non-GAAP): 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income 6,678 10,754 31,167 86,127 Depreciation and amortization of real property 7,904 7,869 25,956 23,289 Net gain on sale of real estate (53,952) FFO (non-GAAP) 14,582 18,623 57,123 55,464 FFO per diluted share (non-GAAP) 2.84 3.63 11.13 10.81 Weighted average shares used in computing FFO per diluted share 5,133,534 5,130,678 5,132,043 5,128,875

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We have exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, which are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates is summarized in the table below. 
 2024 2023 (Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) September 30, Balance Weighted Average Interest Rate Effect of 1 Change in Base Rates December 31, Balance Weighted Average Interest Rate Variable Rate 202,544 5.60 2,025 702,544 5.88 Fixed Rate 794,000 3.52 394,000 1.97 996,544 3.94 2,025 1,096,544 4.48 Total effect on diluted earnings per share 0.39 
 We have an interest rate cap relating to the mortgage loan on Rego Park II shopping center with a notional amount of 202,544,000 that caps SOFR at a rate of 4.15 through November 2024. 
 We have an interest rate swap relating to the mortgage loan on the retail condominium of our 731 Lexington Avenue property with a notional amount of 300,000,000 that swaps SOFR plus 1.51 for a fixed rate of 1.76 through May 2025. 
 Fair Value of Debt 
 The fair value of our consolidated debt is calculated by discounting the future contractual cash flows of these instruments using current risk-adjusted rates available to borrowers with similar credit ratings, which are provided by a third-party specialist. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was 1,010,684,000 and 1,071,887,000, respectively. Our fair value estimates, which are made at the end of the reporting period, may be different from the amounts that may ultimately be realized upon the disposition of our financial instruments. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures: Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 (b) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter to which this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 54 

payment was due or such Default shall have occurred without regard to any grace or cure periods contained herein (but for avoidance of doubt, no Default Interest shall be payable due to the occurrence of a Default for which a cure period is provided herein if such Default is cured during such cure period).

All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum Legal Rate from time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

Borrower, upon the request of such Co-Lender, shall repay to such Co-Lender the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 2.9.4 (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such Co-Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.9.4 , in no event will the Co-Lender be required to pay any amount to Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.9.4 the payment of which would place the Co-Lender in a less favorable net after-tax position than the Co-Lender would have been in if the tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any Co-Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
 2.9.5 Change of Office . To the extent that changing the jurisdiction of any Co-Lender s applicable office would have the effect of minimizing Indemnified Taxes, Other Taxes or Increased Costs, such Co-Lender shall at the request of Borrower use commercially reasonable efforts to make such a change, provided that same would not otherwise be disadvantageous (as reasonably determined by such Co-Lender) or involve any unreimbursed expense to such Co-Lender. 
 2.9.6 Survival . Each party s obligations under this Section 2.9 shall survive any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of a Co-Lender and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations under any Loan Document.

Neither this Guaranty nor any other Loan Document to which Guarantor is a party is subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense by Guarantor (other than a defense of the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations), including the defense of usury, nor would the operation of any of the terms of this Guaranty or such other Loan Documents, or the exercise of any right hereunder or thereunder, render this Guaranty or such other Loan Documents unenforceable, and Guarantor has not asserted any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense with respect thereto.

The Guarantor Claims shall include, without limitation, all rights and claims of Guarantor against Borrower (arising as a result of subrogation or otherwise) as a result of Guarantor s payment of all or a portion of the Guaranteed Obligations. So long as any portion of the Obligations or the Guaranteed Obligations remain outstanding, Guarantor shall not receive or collect, directly or indirectly, from Borrower or any other Person any amount upon the Guarantor Claims. 
 Section 4.2 Claims in Bankruptcy .

Guarantor hereby assigns such dividends, distributions and payments to Lender. Should Lender receive, for application against the Guaranteed Obligations, any dividend or payment which is otherwise payable to Guarantor and which, as between Borrower and Guarantor, shall constitute a credit against the Guarantor Claims, then, upon the ninety-first (91st) day after irrevocable payment to Lender in full of the Obligations and the Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantor shall become subrogated to the rights of Lender to the extent that such 

payments to Lender on the Guarantor Claims have contributed toward the liquidation of the Guaranteed Obligations, and such subrogation shall be with respect to that proportion of the Guaranteed Obligations which would have been unpaid if Lender had not received dividends or payments upon the Guarantor Claims. 
 Section 4.3 Payments Held in Trust . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Guaranty, in the event that Guarantor should receive any funds, payments, claims and or distributions which are prohibited by this Guaranty, Guarantor agrees to hold in trust for Lender an amount equal to the amount of all funds, payments, claims and or distributions so received, and agrees that it shall have absolutely no dominion over the amount of such funds, payments, claims and or distributions so received except to pay such funds, payments, claims and or distributions promptly to Lender, and Guarantor covenants promptly to pay the same to Lender. 
 Section 4.4 Liens Subordinate . Guarantor agrees that any liens, security interests, judgment liens, charges or other encumbrances upon Borrower s assets securing payment of the Guarantor Claims shall be and remain inferior and subordinate to any liens, security interests, judgment liens, charges or other encumbrances upon Borrower s assets securing payment of the Loan and the Guaranteed Obligations, regardless of whether such encumbrances in favor of Guarantor or Lender presently exist or are hereafter created or attach. Without the prior written consent of Lender, Guarantor shall not (i) exercise or enforce any creditor s rights it may have against Borrower, or (ii) foreclose, repossess, sequester or otherwise take steps or institute any action or proceedings (judicial or otherwise, including, without limitation, the commencement of, or the joinder in, any liquidation, bankruptcy, rearrangement, debtor s relief or insolvency proceeding) to enforce any liens, mortgages, deeds of trust, security interests, collateral rights, judgments or other encumbrances on the assets of Borrower held by Guarantor. The foregoing shall in no manner vitiate or amend, nor be deemed to vitiate or amend, (a) any prohibition in the Loan Documents against Borrower granting liens or security interests in any of its assets to any Person other than Lender or (b) any rights of payment that Guarantor may have against Borrower, subject to the other terms of this Guaranty.
