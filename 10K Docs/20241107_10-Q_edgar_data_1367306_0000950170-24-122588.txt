Invesco DB Agriculture Fund 
 Notes to Unaudited F inancial Statements 
 September 30, 2024 
 separate series, was formed on August 3, 2006. The term of the Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances) as provided for in the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust, as amended (the Trust Agreement ). The Fund has an unlimited number of shares authorized for issuance. Invesco Capital Management LLC has served as the managing owner (the Managing Owner ), commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Trust and the Fund since February 23, 2015. The Managing Owner holds general shares (the General Shares of the Fund. The fiscal year end of the Fund is December 31st. The Fund seeks to track changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture Index Excess Return (the Index over time, plus the excess, if any, of the sum of the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations Treasury Income ), dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) Money Market Income and dividends or distributions of capital gains from its holdings of T-Bill ETFs (as defined below) T-Bill ETF Income over the expenses of the Fund. The Fund invests in futures contracts in an attempt to track its Index. The Index is intended to reflect the change in market value of the agricultural sector. The commodities comprising the Index are Corn, Soybeans, Wheat, Kansas City Wheat, Sugar, Cocoa, Coffee, Cotton, Live Cattle, Feeder Cattle and Lean Hogs (each an Index Commodity , and collectively, the Index Commodities ). The Fund may invest directly in United States Treasury Obligations. The Fund may also gain exposure to United States Treasury Obligations through investments in exchange-traded funds ETFs (affiliated or otherwise) that track indexes that measure the performance of United States Treasury Obligations with a maximum remaining maturity of up to months T-Bill ETFs ). The Fund holds as collateral United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs (affiliated or otherwise), if any, for margin and/or cash management purposes. While the Fund's performance reflects the appreciation and depreciation of those holdings, the Fund's performance, whether positive or negative, is driven primarily by its strategy of trading futures contracts with the aim of seeking to track the Index. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC and certain futures exchanges impose position limits on futures contracts that reference Index Commodities (the Index Contracts ). As the Fund approaches or reaches position limits with respect to an Index Commodity, the Fund may commence investing in Index Contracts that reference other Index Commodities. In those circumstances, the Fund may also trade in futures contracts based on commodities other than Index Commodities that the Managing Owner reasonably believes tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with an Index Contract. The Managing Owner may determine to invest in other futures contracts if at any time it is impractical, including in scenarios wherein the futures market for an Index Contract is thinly traded, or inefficient to gain full or partial exposure to an Index Commodity through the use of Index Contracts. These other futures contracts may or may not be based on an Index Commodity. When they are not, the Managing Owner may seek to select futures contracts that it reasonably believes tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with an Index Contract. The Fund offers common units of beneficial interest (the Shares only to certain eligible financial institutions (the Authorized Participants in or more blocks of Shares Creation Units ). The Fund commenced investment operations on January 3, 2007. The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock Exchange (which became the NYSE Alternext US LLC) on January 5, 2007 and, since November 25, 2008, has been listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ). This Quarterly Report (the Report covers the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The accompanying unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). In the opinion of management, all material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the interim period financial statements have been made. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full-year period. These financial statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Fund s financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024 .

per annum of the daily NAV of the Fund (the Management Fee ). The Fund, for cash management purposes, invests in money market mutual funds and/or T-Bill ETFs that are managed by affiliates of the Managing Owner. The indirect portion of the management fee that the Fund incurs through such investments is in addition to the Management Fee paid to the Managing Owner. The Managing Owner has contractually agreed to waive indefinitely the fees that it receives in an amount equal to the indirect management fees that the Fund incurs through its investments in affiliated money market mutual funds and/or affiliated T-Bill ETFs. The Managing Owner may terminate this fee waiver on notice. The Managing Owner waived fees of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Managing Owner waived fees of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Distributor Invesco Distributors, Inc. (the Distributor provides certain distribution services to the Fund. Pursuant to the Distribution Services Agreement among the Managing Owner, the Fund and the Distributor, the Distributor assists the Managing Owner and the Fund s administrator, The Bank of New York Mellon, with certain functions and duties relating to distribution and marketing services to the Fund including reviewing and approving marketing materials. The Managing Owner pays the Distributor a distribution fee out of the Management Fee. The Commodity Broker Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, serves as the Fund s futures clearing broker (the Commodity Broker ). The Commodity Broker is registered with the CFTC as an FCM and is a member of the NFA in such capacity. A variety of executing brokers execute futures transactions on behalf of the Fund. Such executing brokers give-up all such transactions to the Commodity Broker. In its capacity as clearing broker, the Commodity Broker may execute or receive transactions executed by others and clears all of the Fund s futures transactions and performs certain administrative and custodial services for the Fund. The Commodity Broker is responsible, among other things, for providing periodic accountings of all dealings and actions taken by the Trust on behalf of the Fund during the reporting period, together with an accounting of all securities, cash or other indebtedness or obligations held by it or its nominees for or on behalf of the Fund. The Administrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent The Bank of New York Mellon (the Administrator , Custodian and Transfer Agent is the administrator, custodian and transfer agent of the Fund. The Fund and the Administrator have entered into separate administrative and accounting, custodian, transfer agency and service agreements (collectively referred to as the Administration Agreement ). 

 11 

cash equivalents held by the Fund as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Fund considers investments in money market funds to be investments in securities and, accordingly, includes them in its Schedule of Investments. The Fund may deposit cash, United States Treasury Obligations, T-Bill ETFs and money market mutual funds with the Commodity Broker as margin, to the extent permissible under CFTC rules. The combination of the Fund s deposits with its Commodity Broker of cash and United States Treasury Obligations and the unrealized profit or loss on open futures contracts represents the Fund s overall equity in its broker trading account. To meet the Fund s maintenance margin requirements, the Fund holds United States Treasury Obligations with the Commodity Broker. The Fund transfers cash to the Commodity Broker to satisfy variation margin requirements. The Fund earns interest on any excess cash deposited with the Commodity Broker and incurs interest expense on any deficit balance with the Commodity Broker. The brokerage agreement with the Commodity Broker provides for the net settlement of all financial instruments covered by the agreement in the event of default or termination of any one contract. The Managing Owner will utilize any excess cash held at the Commodity Broker to offset any realized losses incurred in the commodity futures contracts, if available. To the extent that any excess cash held at the Commodity Broker is not adequate to cover any realized losses, a portion of the United States Treasury Obligations and T-Bill ETFs, if any, on deposit with the Commodity Broker will be sold to make additional cash available. For financial reporting purposes, the Fund offsets financial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to legally enforceable netting arrangements. The Fund s remaining cash, United States Treasury Obligations, T-Bill ETFs and money market mutual fund holdings are on deposit with the Custodian. The Fund is permitted to temporarily carry a negative or overdrawn balance in its account with the Custodian. The Fund incurs interest expense on any overdraft balance with the Custodian. Such balances, if any at period-end, are shown on the Statements of Financial Condition under the payable caption Due to custodian . Because the Fund s assets are maintained with the Commodity Broker and Custodian, the distress, impairment or failure of the Commodity Broker or Custodian could result in the loss of or delay in access to Fund assets.

or more Creation Units. Each Creation Unit consists of a block of Shares. For purposes of processing both creation and redemption orders, a business day means any day other than a day when banks in New York City are required or permitted to be closed. Creation orders must be placed by 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time. The day on which the Transfer Agent receives a valid creation order is the creation order date. The day on which a creation order is settled is the creation order settlement date. Cash settlement occurs at the creation order settlement date. As provided below, the creation order settlement date may occur up to one business day after the creation order date. By placing a creation order, and prior to delivery of such Creation Units, an Authorized Participant s Depository Trust Company DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the creation order. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Managing Owner and the Authorized Participant as provided in the next sentence, Creation Units are issued on the creation order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day immediately following the creation order date at the applicable NAV per Share as of the closing time of the NYSE Arca or the last to close of the exchanges on which its futures contracts are traded, whichever is later, on the creation order date, but only if the required payment has been timely received. Upon submission of a creation order, the Authorized Participant may request the Managing Owner to agree to a creation order settlement date up to one business day after the creation order date. (b) Redemptions On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Transfer Agent to redeem or more Creation Units. Redemption orders must be placed by 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time. The day on which the Managing Owner receives a valid redemption order is the redemption order date. The day on which a redemption order is settled is the redemption order settlement date. Cash settlement occurs at the redemption order settlement date. As provided below, the redemption order settlement date may occur up to one business day after the redemption order date. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Creation Units. Individual Shareholders may not redeem directly from the Fund. Instead, individual Shareholders may only redeem Shares in integral multiples of and only through an Authorized Participant. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Managing Owner and the Authorized Participant as provided in the next sentence, by placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Creation Units to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to the Fund no later than the redemption order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day immediately following the redemption order date. Upon submission of a redemption order, the Authorized Participant may request the Managing Owner to agree to a redemption order settlement date up to one business day after the redemption order date. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. The redemption proceeds from the Fund consist of the cash redemption amount. The cash redemption amount is equal to the NAV of the number of Creation Unit(s) requested in the Authorized Participant s redemption order as of the closing time of the NYSE Arca or the last to close of the exchanges on which the Fund s futures contracts are traded, whichever is later, on the redemption order date. The Managing Owner will distribute the cash redemption amount at the redemption order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the redemption order settlement date through DTC to the account of the Authorized Participant as recorded on DTC s book-entry system. The redemption proceeds due from the Fund are delivered to the Authorized Participant at 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the redemption order settlement date if, by such time, the Fund s DTC account has been credited with the Creation Units to be redeemed. If the Fund s DTC account has not been credited with all of the Creation Units to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution is delivered to the extent of whole Creation Units received. Any remainder of the redemption distribution is delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole Creation Units received if the Transfer Agent receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which the Managing Owner may, from time to time, determine and the remaining Creation Units to be redeemed are credited to the Fund s DTC account by 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on such next business day. Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order will be cancelled. The Managing Owner is also authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the Creation Units to be redeemed are not credited to the Fund s DTC account by 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the redemption order settlement date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the Creation Units through DTC s book-entry system on such terms as the Managing Owner may determine from time to time.

 Overview/Introduction 
 Invesco DB Agriculture Fund (the Fund ), a separate series of Invesco DB Multi-Sector Commodity Trust (the Trust ), a Delaware statutory trust organized in five separate series, was formed on August 3, 2006. The term of the Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances) as provided for in the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust, as amended (the Trust Agreement ). The Fund has an unlimited number of shares authorized for issuance. 
 Invesco Capital Management LLC has served as the managing owner (the Managing Owner ), commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Trust and the Fund since February 23, 2015. The Managing Owner is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC as a commodity pool operator and a commodity trading advisor, and it is a member firm of the National Futures Association NFA ). 
 The Fund seeks to track changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture Index Excess Return (the Index over time, plus the excess, if any, of the sum of the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations Treasury Income ), dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) Money Market Income and dividends or distributions of capital gains from its holdings of T-Bill ETFs (as defined below) T-Bill ETF Income over the expenses of the Fund. The Fund invests in futures contracts in an attempt to track its Index. The Index is intended to reflect the change in market value of the agricultural sector. The commodities comprising the Index are Corn, Soybeans, Wheat, Kansas City Wheat, Sugar, Cocoa, Coffee, Cotton, Live Cattle, Feeder Cattle and Lean Hogs (each an Index Commodity , and collectively, the Index Commodities ). 
 19 

The Fund may invest directly in United States Treasury Obligations. The Fund may also gain exposure to United States Treasury Obligations through investments in exchange-traded funds ETFs (affiliated or otherwise) that track indexes that measure the performance of United States Treasury Obligations with a maximum remaining maturity of up to 12 months T-Bill ETFs ). The Fund holds as collateral United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs (affiliated or otherwise), if any, for margin and/or cash management purposes. While the Fund's performance reflects the appreciation and depreciation of those holdings, the Fund's performance, whether positive or negative, is driven primarily by its strategy of trading futures contracts with the aim of seeking to track the Index. 
 The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a portfolio of exchange-traded commodity futures contracts that expire in a specific month and trade on a specific exchange (the Index Contracts in the Index Commodities. The notional amounts of each Index Commodity included in the Index are broadly in proportion to historic levels of the world s production and stocks of the Index Commodities. The Fund also holds United States Treasury Obligations and T-Bill ETFs, if any, for deposit with Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, the Fund s commodity broker (the Commodity Broker as margin, to the extent permissible under CFTC rules and United States Treasury Obligations, cash, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs (affiliated or otherwise), if any, on deposit with The Bank of New York Mellon (the Custodian ), for cash management purposes. The aggregate notional value of the commodity futures contracts owned by the Fund is expected to approximate the aggregate net asset value NAV of the Fund, as opposed to the aggregate Index value. 
 The CFTC and certain futures exchanges impose position limits on futures contracts, including on Index Contracts. As the Fund approaches or reaches position limits with respect to an Index Commodity, the Fund may commence investing in Index Contracts that reference other Index Commodities. In those circumstances, the Fund may also trade in futures contracts based on commodities other than Index Commodities that the Managing Owner reasonably believes tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with an Index Contract. 
 The Managing Owner may determine to invest in other futures contracts if at any time it is impractical, including in scenarios wherein the futures market for an Index Contract is thinly traded, or inefficient to gain full or partial exposure to an Index Commodity through the use of Index Contracts. These other futures contracts may or may not be based on an Index Commodity. When they are not, the Managing Owner may seek to select futures contracts that it reasonably believes tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with an Index Contract. 
 The Shares are intended to provide investment results that generally correspond to the changes, positive or negative, in the levels of the Index over time. The value of the Shares is expected to fluctuate in relation to changes in the value of the Fund s portfolio. The market price of the Shares may not be identical to the NAV per Share, but these two valuations are expected to be very close. 
 Index Description 
 The Managing Owner has entered into a license agreement with Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (the Index Sponsor to use the Index. The Managing Owner pays the Index Sponsor a licensing fee and an index services fee for performing its duties. 
 These fees constitute a portion of the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses which are paid out of the management fee paid to the Managing Owner (the "Management Fee") and are not charged to or reimbursed by the Fund. 
 Neither the Managing Owner nor any affiliate of the Managing Owner has any rights to influence the selection of the futures contracts underlying the Index. 
 The Fund is not sponsored or endorsed by Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. or any subsidiary or affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG or Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (collectively, Deutsche Bank ). The DBIQ Diversified Agriculture Index Excess Return (the Index is the exclusive property of Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. DBIQ is a service mark of Deutsche Bank AG and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Under no circumstances may any person or entity claim any affiliation with Deutsche Bank without the written permission of Deutsche Bank. 
 The Index Sponsor may from time to time subcontract the provision of the calculation and other services described below to one or more third parties. The Index is composed of notional amounts of each of the underlying Index Commodities. The notional amount of each Index Commodity included in the Index is intended to reflect the changes in market value of each such Index Commodity within the Index. The closing level of the Index is calculated on each business day by the Index Sponsor based on the closing price of the commodity futures contracts for each of the Index Commodities and the notional amount of such Index Commodity. 
 The Index is rebalanced annually in November to ensure that each of the Index Commodities is weighted in the same proportion that such Index Commodities were weighted on January 18, 1989. The composition of the Index may be adjusted in the event that the Index Sponsor is not able to calculate the closing prices of the Index Commodities.

 Market Risk 
 Trading in futures contracts involves the Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase a particular commodity at a specified date and price. The market risk associated with the Fund s commitments to purchase commodities is limited to the gross or face amount of the contracts held. 
 The Fund s exposure to market risk is also influenced by a number of factors including the volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the liquidity of the markets in which the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held. The inherent uncertainty of the Fund s trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of the investors capital. 
 21 

Credit Risk 
 When the Fund enters into futures contracts, the Fund is exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations. The counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and on most foreign futures exchanges is the clearing house associated with the particular exchange. In general, clearing houses are backed by their corporate members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and, as such, is designed to disperse and mitigate the credit risk posed by any other one member. In cases where the clearing house is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges), it may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearing member or clearinghouse will meet its obligations to the Fund. 
 The Commodity Broker, when acting as the Fund s futures commission merchant FCM in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures contracts, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the Fund all assets of the Fund relating to domestic futures trading. The Commodity Broker is not allowed to commingle such assets with other assets of the Commodity Broker. In addition, CFTC regulations also require the Commodity Broker to hold in a secure account assets of the Fund related to foreign futures trading. While these legal requirements are designed to protect the customers of FCMs, a failure by the Commodity Broker to comply with those requirements would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the Fund in the event that the Commodity Broker became insolvent or suffered other financial distress. 
 Liquidity 
 The Fund s entire source of capital is derived from the Fund s offering of Shares to Authorized Participants. The Fund in turn allocates its net assets to commodity futures trading. A significant portion of the NAV is held in United States Treasury Obligations, which may be used as margin for the Fund s trading in commodity futures contracts and United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds, cash and T-Bill ETFs, if any, which may be used for cash management purposes. The percentage that United States Treasury Obligations bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the Fund s commodity interests change. A portion of the Fund s United States Treasury Obligations are held for deposit with the Commodity Broker to meet margin requirements. All remaining cash, money market mutual funds, T-Bill ETFs, if any, and United States Treasury Obligations are on deposit with the Custodian. Interest earned on the Fund s interest-bearing funds and dividends from the Fund s holdings of money market mutual funds are paid to the Fund. Any dividends or distributions of capital gains received from the Fund s holdings of T-Bill ETFs, if any, are paid to the Fund. 
 The Fund s commodity futures contracts may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations or for other reasons. For example, U.S. futures exchanges and some foreign exchanges have regulations that limit the amount of fluctuation in futures contract prices that may occur during a single business day. These limits are generally referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits, and the maximum or minimum price of a contract on any given day as a result of these limits is referred to as a limit price. Once a limit price has been reached in a particular contract, it is usually the case that no trades may be made at a different price than specified in the limit. The duration of limit prices generally varies. Limit prices may have the effect of precluding the Fund from trading in a particular contract or requiring the Fund to liquidate contracts at disadvantageous times or prices. Either of those outcomes could adversely affect the Fund s ability to pursue its investment objective. 
 Because the Fund trades futures contracts, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of futures contracts (market risk) or the inability of counterparties (including the Commodity Broker and/or exchange clearinghouses) to perform under the terms of the contracts (credit risk). 
 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Transfer Agent to redeem one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares Creation Units ). Redemption orders must be placed by 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time. The day on which the Managing Owner receives a valid redemption order is the redemption order date. The day on which a redemption order is settled is the redemption order settlement date. As provided below, the redemption order settlement date may occur up to one business day after the redemption order date. Redemption orders are irrevocable. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Creation Units. Individual Shareholders may not redeem directly from the Fund. Instead, individual Shareholders may only redeem Shares in integral multiples of 50,000 and only through an Authorized Participant. 
 Unless otherwise agreed to by the Managing Owner and the Authorized Participant as provided in the next sentence, by placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Creation Units to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to the Fund no later than the redemption order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day immediately following the redemption order date. Upon submission of a redemption order, the Authorized Participant may request the Managing Owner to agree to a redemption order settlement date up to one business day after the redemption order date. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. 
 22 

Redemption orders may be placed either (i) through the Continuous Net Settlement CNS clearing processes of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (the NSCC (the CNS Clearing Process or (ii) if outside the CNS Clearing Process, only through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company DTC or the Depository (the DTC Process ), or a successor depository, and only in exchange for cash. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order and such fee is not borne by the Fund. 
 The Fund is unaware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the Fund's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. 
 Capital Resources 
 The Fund does not have any material cash requirements as of the end of the latest fiscal period. The Fund is unaware of any known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in the Fund s capital resources. 
 In the normal course of its business, the Fund is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The term off-balance sheet risk refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in a future obligation or loss. The financial instruments used by the Fund are commodity futures, the values of which are based upon an underlying asset and generally represent future commitments which have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash or through physical delivery. The financial instruments are traded on an exchange and are standardized contracts. 
 The Fund has not utilized, nor does it expect to utilize in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements and has no loan guarantee arrangements or off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind, other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business noted above, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in providing services to the Fund. While the Fund s exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Fund s financial position. The Managing Owner expects the risk of loss relating to indemnification to be remote. 
 The Fund has financial obligations to the Managing Owner and the Commodity Broker under the Trust Agreement and its agreement with the Commodity Broker (the Commodity Broker Agreement ), respectively. Management Fee payments made to the Managing Owner, pursuant to the Trust Agreement, are calculated as a fixed percentage of the Fund s NAV. Commission payments to the Commodity Broker, pursuant to the Commodity Broker Agreement, are on a contract-by-contract, or round-turn, basis. As such, the Managing Owner cannot anticipate the number of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as NAVs and trading activity will not be known until a future date. The Fund s agreement with the Commodity Broker may be terminated by either party for various reasons. All Management Fees and commission payments are paid to the Managing Owner and the Commodity Broker, respectively. 
 Cash Flows 
 A primary cash flow activity of the Fund is to raise capital from Authorized Participants through the issuance of Shares. This cash is used to invest in United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs, if any, and to meet margin requirements as a result of the positions taken in futures contracts to match the fluctuations of the Index.

 The following graphs illustrate the percentage changes in (i) the market price of the Shares (as reflected by the line Market ), (ii) the Fund s NAV (as reflected by the line NAV ), and (iii) the closing levels of the Index (as reflected by the line DBIQ Diversified Agriculture Index ER ). Whenever the Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income, if any, earned by the Fund exceeds Fund expenses, the price of the Shares generally exceeds the level of the Index primarily because the Share price reflects Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income from the Fund s collateral holdings whereas the Index does not consider such income. There can be no assurances that the price of the Shares or the Fund s NAV will exceed the Index levels. 
 No representation is being made that the Index will or is likely to achieve closing levels consistent with or similar to those set forth herein. Similarly, no representation is being made that the Fund will generate profits or losses similar to the Fund s past performance or changes in the Index closing levels.

Performance Summary 
 This Report covers the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Past performance of the Fund is not necessarily indicative of future performance. 
 The Index is intended to reflect the change in market value of the Index Commodities. In turn, the notional amounts of each Index Commodity are broadly in proportion to historic levels of the world s production and stocks of such Index Commodities. The DBIQ Diversified Agriculture Index Total Return (the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture TR consists of the Index plus 3-month United States Treasury Obligations returns. Past results of the Index and the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture TR are not necessarily indicative of future changes, positive or negative. 
 The section Summary of the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture TR and Underlying Index Commodity Returns for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 below provides an overview of the changes in the closing levels of the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture TR by disclosing the change in market value of each underlying component Index Commodity through a surrogate (and analogous) index that also reflects 3-month United States Treasury Obligations returns. Please note also that the Fund s objective is to track the Index (not the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture TR and the Fund does not attempt to outperform or underperform the Index. The Index employs the optimum yield roll method with the objective of mitigating the negative effects of contango, the condition in which distant delivery prices for futures exceed spot prices, and maximizing the positive effects of backwardation, a condition opposite of contango.

If the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income were to exceed the Fund s fees and expenses, the aggregate return on an investment in the Fund would be expected to outperform the Index and underperform the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture TR . The only difference between (i) the Index (the Excess Return Index and (ii) the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture TR (the Total Return Index is that the Excess Return Index does not include interest income from fixed income securities while the Total Return Index does include such a component. Thus, the difference between the Excess Return Index and the Total Return Index is attributable entirely to the interest income attributable to the fixed income securities reflected in the Total Return Index. The Total Return Index does not actually hold any fixed income securities. If the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income, if any, exceeds the Fund s fees and expenses, then the amount of such excess is expected to be distributed periodically. The market price of the Shares is expected to closely track the Excess Return Index. The aggregate return on an investment in the Fund over any period is the sum of the capital appreciation or depreciation of the Shares over the period, plus the amount of any distributions during the period. Consequently, the Fund s aggregate return is expected to outperform the Excess Return Index by the amount of the excess, if any, of the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income over its fees and expenses. As a result of the Fund s fees and expenses, however, the aggregate return on the Fund is expected to underperform the 
 27 

Total Return Index. If the Fund s fees and expenses were to exceed the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income, if any, the aggregate return on an investment in the Fund is expected to underperform the Excess Return Index. 
 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 Fund Share Price Performance 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the NYSE Arca market value of each Share increased from 23.81 per Share to 26.10 per Share. The Share price low and high for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and related change from the Share price on June 30, 2024 was as follows: Shares traded at a low of 23.26 per Share (-2.31 on August 1, 2024, and a high of 26.56 per Share (+11.55 on September 27, 2024. The total return for the Fund on a market value basis was +9.62 . 
 Agricultural commodities continued to move higher in the third quarter of 2024, however the bifurcation between grains and soft commodities continued. Cocoa and coffee were the top contributors, supported by persisting supply shortfalls. In contrast, for grains, while there were pockets of adverse weather, specifically in Europe and the US, the markets largely expected there to be enough cushion to weather those losses, keeping prices capped. Soybeans and corn were the largest detractors in the quarter, followed by feeder and live cattle, which fell on the availability of cheaper alternatives. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the NYSE Arca market value of each Share increased from 21.08 per Share to 21.40 per Share. The Share price low and high for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and related change from the Share price on June 30, 2023 was as follows: Shares traded at a low of 21.09 per Share (+0.05 on August 15, 2023, and a high of 22.37 per Share (+6.12 on July 25, 2023. The total return for the Fund on a market value basis was +1.52 . 
 Agricultural commodities posted slight positive performance in the third quarter of 2023, with most of the gains coming from sugar. Front month sugar prices rose nearly 15 over the quarter as concerns over a domestic supply shortfall rose with India, the world s second largest sugar exporter, closing in on an export ban. Cocoa also rose on deteriorating crops in West Africa but fell sharply to end the quarter. While grains gained in July after Russia pulled out of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) and escalated attacks on Ukraine s grain export infrastructure, prices retreated starting the last week of July. Improving weather outlooks across the US Midwest, another bumper Russian wheat harvest, strong corn and soybean harvests in Brazil and the availability of alternative shipping routes all helped ease the blow from escalating tensions in Ukraine. US grains remained largely uncompetitive on global markets, sending prices even lower in September. 
 Fund Share Net Asset Performance 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the NAV of each Share increased from 23.92 per Share to 26.05 per Share. Rising commodity futures contract prices for Cocoa, Coffee, Cotton, Lean Hogs, Live Cattle, Sugar and Wheat were partially offset by falling commodity futures contract prices of Corn, Feeder Cattle, Kansas City Wheat and Soybeans during the three months ended September 30, 2024, contributing to an overall 7.67 increase in the level of the Index and to a 9.09 increase in the level of the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture Index TR . The total return for the Fund on a NAV basis was +8.90 . 
 Net income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 59.8 million, primarily resulting from 9.2 million of income, net realized gain (loss) of (33.5) million, net change in unrealized gain (loss) of 85.7 million and net operating expenses of 1.6 million. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the NAV of each Share increased from 21.10 per Share to 21.42 per Share. Rising commodity futures contract prices for Cocoa, Cotton, Feeder Cattle, Lean Hogs, Live Cattle and Sugar were partially offset by falling commodity futures contract prices of Coffee, Corn, Kansas City Wheat, Soybeans and Wheat during the three months ended September 30, 2023, contributing to an overall 0.42 increase in the level of the Index and to a 1.78 increase in the level of the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture Index TR . The total return for the Fund on a NAV basis was +1.52 . 
 Net income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 13.2 million, primarily resulting from 11.2 million of income, net realized gain (loss) of 13.0 million, net change in unrealized gain (loss) of (9.2) million and net operating expenses of 1.8 million. 
 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 Fund Share Price Performance 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the NYSE Arca market value of each Share increased from 20.73 per Share to 26.10 per Share. The Share price low and high for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and related change from the Share price on December 31, 2023 was as follows: Shares traded at a low of 20.52 per Share (-1.01 on January 8, 2024, and a high of 26.56 per Share (+28.13 on September 27, 2024. The total return for the Fund on a market value basis was +25.90 . 
 28 

Agricultural commodities ended the first three quarters of 2024 with strong positive performance, though cocoa was the dominant driver. Front month prices skyrocketed over 180 between the start of the year and its peak in mid-April, repeatedly surpassing all-time highs as crop-damaging disease and adverse weather in West Africa fueled worries for a global supply shortfall. However, front month prices did ease in the second and end of third quarter on increased profit-taking. The other contributors were coffee and livestock commodities which also faced supply concerns. Grains, on the other hand, all retreated on ample global supplies and lacking US competitiveness. While renewed weather concerns did take the market by surprise in April and May, sending wheat skyrocketing, the rally was short-lived. Corn and soybeans led the losses year-to-date as the US is expected to have close to record yields due to favorable weather. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the NYSE Arca market value of each Share increased from 20.15 per Share to 21.40 per Share. The Share price low and high for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and related change from the Share price on December 31, 2022 was as follows: Shares traded at a low of 19.36 per Share (-3.92 on January 19, 2023, and a high of 22.37 per Share (+11.02 on July 25, 2023. The total return for the Fund on a market value basis was +6.20 . 
 Agricultural commodities remained in positive territory for the first three quarters of 2023, supported by gains in sugar, cocoa, live cattle, and feeder cattle. The cocoa rally was driven by supply shortfalls in the Ivory Coast, the largest global exporter, while sugar prices rallied on Indian export uncertainty. Live cattle and feeder cattle also added positive performance on dwindled herd counts, while grains (wheat, corn, soybeans) were all detractors. Robust wheat harvests from Russia and Australia, projections for bumper Brazilian corn and soybeans harvests, as well as the continued extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI), continued to ease supply concerns through the first half of the year. While Russia did pull out of the BSGI in July, the impact was mitigated given strong Russian wheat exports and the availability of alternative shipping routes. US grains were also largely uncompetitive on global markets, adding further pressure. 
 Fund Share Net Asset Performance 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the NAV of each Share increased from 20.74 per Share to 26.05 per Share. Rising commodity futures contract prices for Cocoa, Coffee, Feeder Cattle, Lean Hogs, Live Cattle and Sugar were partially offset by falling commodity futures contract prices of Corn, Cotton, Kansas City Wheat, Soybeans and Wheat during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, contributing to an overall 21.53 increase in the level of the Index and to a 26.47 increase in the level of the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture Index TR . The total return for the Fund on a NAV basis was +25.60 . 
 Net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 162.2 million, primarily resulting from 28.9 million of income, net realized gain (loss) of 92.0 million, net change in unrealized gain (loss) of 46.2 million and net operating expenses of 4.8 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the NAV of each Share increased from 20.16 per Share to 21.42 per Share. Rising commodity futures contract prices for Cocoa, Cotton, Feeder Cattle, Live Cattle and Sugar, were partially offset by falling commodity futures contract prices of Coffee, Corn, Kansas City Wheat, Lean Hogs, Soybeans and Wheat during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, contributing to an overall 3.11 increase in the level of the Index and to a 7.10 increase in the level of the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture Index TR . The total return for the Fund on a NAV basis was +6.25 . 
 Net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 49.9 million, primarily resulting from 32.5 million of income, net realized gain (loss) of 31.3 million, net change in unrealized gain (loss) of (8.0) million and net operating expenses of 5.9 million. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates

 ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 INTRODUCTION 
 The Fund is designed to track the performance of the Index. The market sensitive instruments held by it are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Fund s main line of business. 
 29 

Market movements can produce frequent changes in the fair market value of the Fund s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash flow. The Fund s market risk is primarily influenced by changes in the prices of commodities. 
 QUANTIFYING THE FUND S TRADING VALUE AT RISK 
 Quantitative Forward-Looking Statements 
 The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact (such as the dollar amount of maintenance margin required for market risk sensitive instruments held at the end of the reporting period). 
 30 

Value at Risk VaR is a statistical measure of the value of losses that would not be expected to be exceeded over a given time horizon and at a given probability level arising from movement of underlying risk factors. Loss is measured as a decline in the fair value of the portfolio as a result of changes in any of the material variables by which fair values are determined. VaR is measured over a specified holding period (one day) and to a specified level of statistical confidence (99th percentile). However, the inherent uncertainty in the markets in which the Fund trades and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Fund of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated VaR or the Fund s experience to date (i.e., risk of ruin ). In light of these considerations, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the following VaR presentation does not constitute any assurance or representation that the Fund s losses in any market sector will be limited to VaR. 
 THE FUND S TRADING VALUE AT RISK 
 The Fund calculates VaR using the actual historical market movements of the Fund s net assets. 
 The following table indicates the trading VaR associated with the Fund s net assets as of September 30, 2024.

The VaR represents the one day downside risk, under normal market conditions, with a 99 confidence level. It is calculated using historical market moves of the Fund s net assets and uses a one year look-back. 
 THE FUND S NON-TRADING MARKET RISK 
 The Fund has non-trading market risk as a result of investing in short-term United States Treasury Obligations, T-Bill ETFs and money market mutual funds. The market risk represented by these investments is not expected to be material. Although the Fund purchases and sells shares of T-Bill ETFs on an exchange, it does not establish or liquidate those positions for trading purposes. 
 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING PRIMARY TRADING MARKET RISK EXPOSURES 
 The following qualitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures except for those disclosures that are statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The Fund s primary market risk exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures of the Fund. The Fund s current market exposure may change materially. Investors may lose all or substantially all of their investment in the Fund. 
 The following were the primary trading risk exposures of the Fund as of September 30, 2024 by market sector:

 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING NON-TRADING MARKET RISK EXPOSURE 
 As noted above, the Fund has non-trading market risk as a result of investing in short-term United States Treasury Obligations, T-Bill ETFs and money market mutual funds. The market risk represented by these investments is not expected to be material. 
 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING MEANS OF MANAGING RISK EXPOSURE 
 Under ordinary circumstances, the Managing Owner s exercise of discretionary power is limited to determining whether the Fund will make a distribution. Under emergency or extraordinary circumstances, the Managing Owner s use of its discretionary powers may increase. These special circumstances, for example, include the unavailability of the Index or certain natural or man-made disasters. The Managing Owner does not actively manage the Fund to avoid losses. The Fund only takes long positions in investments and does not employ stop-loss techniques.
