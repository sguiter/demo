CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange
Act that are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management, and
which statements involve substantial risk and uncertainties. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than
statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, our business strategy
and plans, market growth and trends, and objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements
because they contain words such as may, will, should, expects, plans, 
 anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, 
 believes, estimates, predicts, potential, or continue or the negative
of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. 

These
statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore,
actual outcomes and results may, and are likely to, differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements
due to numerous factors, including those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our
other filings with SEC. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things: 

Changing
 conditions in global markets including the impact of sanctions and tariffs, quotas and other trade actions and import restrictions
 which may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. 

Changes
 in the availability or price of inputs such as raw materials and end-of-life vehicles which could reduce our sales. 

Significant
 decreases in scrap metal prices which may adversely impact our operating results. 

Imbalances
 in supply and demand conditions in the global steel industry which may reduce demand for our products. 

Impairment
 of long-lived assets and equity investments which may adversely affect our operating results. 

Governmental
 agencies refusal to grant or renew our licenses and permits, thus restricting our ability to operate. 

Compliance
with existing and future climate change and greenhouse gas emission laws and regulations which may adversely impact our operating results. 

You
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we disclaim any obligation to publicly
update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise,
after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by applicable
law.

p.m. eastern on May 31, 2024. All common share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments and reclassifications and non-recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company s results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
and its financial position as of September 30, 2024 have been made. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. 

Certain
information and disclosures normally included in the notes to the annual consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted
from these interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these interim unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024 (the Annual Report ).
The December 31, 2023 balance sheet is derived from those statements. 

and working capital (current assets in excess of current liabilities) of .
The accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 was ). These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

If
the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, its stockholders would experience dilution. Additional debt financing,
if available, may involve covenants restricting its operations or its ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing
or additional equity that the Company raises may contain terms that are not favorable to it or its stockholders and require significant
debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. The Company s ability to raise additional capital will be
impacted by market conditions and the price of the Company s common stock. 

Accordingly,
the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for one year from the date the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements are issued. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

per bank. The Company minimizes this risk by placing its cash deposits with major financial
institutions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the uninsured balances amounted to and , respectively. 

The
Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors, including the aging of customer receivable
balances, the financial condition of the Company s customers, historical collection rates, and economic trends. Management uses
this evaluation to estimate the amount of customer receivables that may not be collected in the future and records a provision for expected
credit losses. Accounts are written off when all efforts to collect have been exhausted. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
the accounts receivable balances amounted to and , respectively. 

and , respectively, as of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. See Note 5 Inventories. 

and for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Advertising costs were and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively. 

The
Company continuously assesses its potential liability for remediation-related activities and adjusts its environmental-related accruals
as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated and as additional accounting guidelines are
issued. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had accruals reported on the balance sheet as current liabilities
of and , respectively, as the Company had paid all civil penalties and completed all remediation activities required under the Virginia
DEQ Consent Order dated June 30, 2021. 

Actual
costs incurred may vary from the accrued estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved including, among others, the nature and
magnitude of the wastes involved, the various technologies that can be used for remediation and the determination of acceptable remediation
with respect to a particular site. Additionally, costs for environmental-related activities may not be reasonably estimable and therefore

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes
contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Please also refer to the note about forward-looking information for information
on such statements contained in this Quarterly Report immediately preceding Part I, Item 1. 

Overview 

We
were formed in April 26, 2013 as a technology platform developer under the name MassRoots, Inc. In October 2021, we changed our corporate
name from MassRoots, Inc. to Greenwave Technology Solutions, Inc. We sold all of our social media assets
on October 28, 2021 and have discontinued all operations related to our social media business. On September 30, 2021, we closed our acquisition
of Empire Services, Inc. Empire ), which operates 13 metal recycling facilities in Virginia, North Carolina, and Ohio.
The acquisition was effective October 1, 2021 upon the effectiveness of the Certificate of Merger in Virginia. 

Upon
the acquisition of Empire, we transitioned into the scrap metal industry which involves collecting, classifying and processing appliances,
construction material, end-of-life vehicles, boats, and industrial machinery. We process these items by crushing, shearing, shredding,
separating, and sorting, into smaller pieces and categorize these recycled ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed metal pieces based on density
and metal prior to sale. In cases of scrap cars, we remove the catalytic converters, aluminum wheels, and batteries for separate processing
and sale prior to shredding the vehicle. We have designed our systems to maximize the value of metals produced from this process. 

We
operate an automotive shredder at our Kelford, North Carolina location and a second automotive shredder at our Carrollton, Virginia location
is expected to come online in the fourth quarter of 2024. Our shredders are designed to produce a denser product and, in concert with
advanced separation equipment, more refined recycled ferrous metals, which are more valuable as they require less processing to produce
recycled steel products. In totality, this process reduces large metal objects like auto bodies into baseball-sized pieces of shredded
recycled metal. 

32 

The
shredded pieces are then placed on a conveyor belt under magnetized drums to separate the ferrous metal from the mixed nonferrous metal
and residue, producing consistent and high-quality ferrous scrap metal. The nonferrous metals and other materials then go through a number
of additional mechanical systems which separate the nonferrous metal from any residue. The remaining nonferrous metal is further processed
to sort the metal by type, grade, and quality prior to being sold as products, such as zorba (mainly aluminum), zurik (mainly stainless
steel), and shredded insulated wire (mainly copper and aluminum). 

One
of our main corporate priorities is to open a facility with rail or deep-water port access to enable us to efficiently transport our
products to domestic steel mills and overseas foundries. Because this would greatly expand the number of potential buyers of our processed
scrap products, we believe opening a facility with port or rail access could result in an increase in both the revenue and profitability
of our existing operations. 

Empire
is headquartered in Chesapeake, Virginia and employs 167 people as of November 8, 2024. 

Products
and Services 

Our
main product is selling ferrous metal, which is used in the recycling and production of finished steel. It is categorized into heavy
melting steel, plate and structural, and shredded scrap, with various grades of each of those categorizations based on the content, size
and consistency of the metal. All of these attributes affect the metal s value. 

We
also process nonferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, stainless steel, nickel, brass, titanium, lead, alloys and mixed metal products.
Additionally, we sell the catalytic converters recovered from end-of-life vehicles to processors which extract the nonferrous precious
metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium. 

We
provide metal recycling services to a wide range of suppliers, including large corporations, industrial manufacturers, retail customers,
and government organizations. 

Pricing
and Customers 

Prices
for our ferrous and nonferrous products are based on prevailing market rates and are subject to market cycles, worldwide steel demand,
government regulations and policy, and supply of products that can be processed into recycled steel. Our main buyers adjust the prices
they pay for scrap metal products based on market rates usually on a monthly or bi-weekly basis. We are usually paid for the scrap metal
we deliver to customers within 14 days of delivery. 

Based
on any price changes from our customers or our other buyers, we in turn adjust the price for unprocessed scrap we pay suppliers in order
to manage the impact on our operating income and cash flows. 

The
spread we are able to realize between the sales prices and the cost of purchasing scrap metal is determined by a number of factors, including
transportation and processing costs. Historically, we have experienced sustained periods of stable or rising metal selling prices, which
allow us to manage or increase our operating income. When selling prices decline, we adjust the prices we pay customers to minimize the
impact to our operating income. 

Sources
of Unprocessed Metal 

Our
main sources of unprocessed metal we purchase are end-of-life vehicles, old equipment, appliances and other consumer goods, and scrap
metal from construction or manufacturing operations. We acquire this unprocessed metal from a wide base of suppliers including large
corporations, industrial manufacturers, retail customers, and government organizations who unload their metal at our facilities or we
pick it up and transport it from the supplier s location. Currently, our operations and main suppliers are located in the Hampton
Roads and northeastern North Carolina markets. In the second quarter of 2023, we expanded our operations by opening a metal recycling
facility in Cleveland, Ohio. 

Our
supply of scrap metal is influenced by the overall health of economic activity in the United States, changes in prices for recycled metal,
and, to a lesser extent, seasonal factors such as severe weather conditions, which may prohibit or inhibit scrap metal collection. 

33 

Competition 

We
compete with several large, well-financed recyclers of scrap metal, steel mills which own their own scrap metal processing operations,
and with smaller metal recycling companies. Demand for metal products is sensitive to global economic conditions, the relative value
of the U.S. dollar, and availability of material alternatives, including recycled metal substitutes. Prices for recycled metal are also
influenced by tariffs, quotas, and other import restrictions, and by licensing and government requirements. 

We
aim to create a competitive advantage through our ability to process significant volumes of metal products and utilize the technology
solutions, our use of processing and separation equipment, the number and location of our facilities, and the operating synergies we
have been able to develop based on our experience.

Capital
Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash on hand of 15,199,655. We currently have no external sources of liquidity such as arrangements with
credit institutions that will have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or immediate
access to capital. 

Required
Capital over the Next Fiscal Year 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 15,199,655 and working capital (current assets in excess of current liabilities) of 6,766,724.
The accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 was (477,931,850). These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

If
the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, its stockholders would experience dilution. Additional debt financing,
if available, may involve covenants restricting its operations or its ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing
or additional equity that the Company raises may contain terms that are not favorable to it or its stockholders and require significant
debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. The Company s ability to raise additional capital will be
impacted by market conditions and the price of the Company s common stock. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Contractual
Obligations 

Our
contractual obligations are included in our notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item
I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. To the extent that funds generated from our operations, together with our existing capital resources,
are insufficient to meet future requirements, we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings. No assurance
can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise.

Special
Meeting of Stockholders on July 19, 2024 

On
July 19, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders at which stockholders approved (i) the adoption of an amendment to
the Company s Amended and Restated By-laws to decrease the number of shares of Common Stock needed to establish a quorum for meetings
of stockholders; (ii) amendment to the Company s 2024 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of the Company s
Common Stock available and reserved for issuance thereunder to 3,000,000, subject to certain conditions; and (iii) the issuance of warrants
to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,104,382 shares of Common Stock, and the issuance of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of such warrants, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d). 

Notice
of Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard 

On
September 13, 2024, the Company received a letter (the Nasdaq Staff Deficiency Letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that, for the last thirty (30) consecutive business days, the bid price for the Company s common
stock had closed below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(a)(2). 

In
accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until March
12, 2025, to regain compliance. The letter states that the Nasdaq staff will provide written notification that the Company has achieved
compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) if at any time before March 12, 2025, the bid price of the Company s common stock closes at 1.00
per share or more for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive business days. The Nasdaq Staff Deficiency Letter has no immediate effect on
the listing or trading of the Company s common stock. 

The
Company intends to monitor the bid price of its common stock and consider available options if its common stock does not trade at a level
likely to result in the Company regaining compliance with Nasdaq s minimum bid price rule by March 12, 2025. 

If
the Company does not regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) by March 12, 2025, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar
day compliance period. To qualify, the Company would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly
held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and
would need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, for example, by effecting
a reverse stock split, if necessary. However, if it appears to the Nasdaq staff that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency,
or if the Company is otherwise not eligible, Nasdaq would notify the Company that its securities would be subject to delisting. In the
event of such a notification, the Company may appeal the Nasdaq staff s determination to delist its securities. There can be no
assurance that the Company will be eligible for the additional 180 calendar day compliance period, if applicable, or that the Nasdaq
staff would grant the Company s request for continued listing subsequent to any delisting notification.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Pursuant
to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15-d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Interim Chief Financial Officer CFO of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. The term disclosure controls and procedures, 
as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including
its principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based
upon such evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were not effective
(at a reasonable assurance level) due to identified control deficiencies regarding the lack of segregation of duties and the need for
a stronger internal control environment. 

To
address the material weaknesses, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures in an effort to ensure our financial
statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the U.S. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report fairly present in all material
respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (issued in 2013). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Based
upon the assessments, management has concluded that as of September 30, 2024, there was a material weakness in our internal control over
financial reporting due to the fact that we did not have an adequate process established to ensure appropriate levels of review of accounting
and financial reporting matters, which resulted in our closing process not identifying all required adjustments and disclosures in a
timely fashion. 

We
plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. To remediate our material weaknesses,
we plan to appoint additional qualified personnel with the requisite knowledge to improve the levels of review of accounting and financial
reporting matters; however, such remediation efforts are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing or generating significant
revenue to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. 

Until
we remediate our material weakness in internal control over financial reporting such weaknesses could result in material misstatements
in our financial statements not being prevented or detected. 

40 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company s internal control over
financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. 

The
Company s CEO and CFO has identified control deficiencies regarding the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger
internal control environment. The small size of the Company s accounting staff may prevent adequate controls in the future, such
as segregation of duties, due to the cost/benefit of such remediation. 

Because
of the above material weakness, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2024, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. 

This
Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm
pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this
Quarterly Report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the most recent fiscal quarter, the Company began hiring additional accounting personnel to enhance its segregation of duties and establishment
of procedures in an effort to ensure appropriate levels of review of accounting and financial reporting matters.
