years and consisted of leases classified as operating leases and an additional leases accounted for as direct financing leases. The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Typically, the Property leases provide for initial terms of to years. The Properties are generally leased under triple-net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for all operating expenses of the Property, including utilities, real estate taxes and assessments, property and liability insurance, maintenance, repairs and capital expenditures. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the Consumer Price Index or fixed increases. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN's lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the renewal options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property.

The following is a summary of the risks and uncertainties, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause NNN's actual results to differ materially from those presented in NNN's forward-looking statement: 
 Changes in financial and economic conditions, including inflation, may have an adverse impact on NNN, its tenants and commercial real estate in general; 

Loss of rent from tenants would reduce NNN's cash flow; 

A significant portion of the source of the Property Portfolio annual base rent is concentrated in specific industry classifications, tenants and geographic locations; 

NNN may not be able to successfully execute its acquisition or development strategies; 

NNN may not be able to dispose of Properties consistent with its operating strategy; 

Certain provisions of NNN's leases or loan agreements may be unenforceable; 

Competition from numerous other real estate investment trusts REIT ), commercial developers, real estate limited partnerships and other investors or a lack of properties for sale may impede NNN's ability to grow; 

A natural disaster or impacts of weather or other event resulting in uninsured loss may adversely affect the operations of NNN's tenants and therefore the ability of NNN's tenants to pay rent, NNN's operating results and asset values of NNN's Property Portfolio (as defined below); 

NNN's ability to fully control the management of its net-leased Properties may be limited; 

Bankrupt tenants or vacant Properties could adversely affect NNN's business or financial condition; 

Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents as well as other significant disruptions of NNN's information technology networks and related systems and resources, or those of NNN's vendors or other third-parties, could adversely affect NNN's business, disrupt operations and expose NNN to liabilities to tenants, associates, capital providers, governmental regulators and other third parties; 

NNN relies upon cloud computing services to operate certain aspects of its business and any disruption could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations; 

Future investment in international markets could subject NNN to additional risks; 

NNN may suffer a loss in the event of a default or bankruptcy of a borrower; 

Property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships could limit NNN's control of those investments; 

NNN may be unable to obtain debt or equity capital on favorable terms, if at all; 

The amount of debt NNN has and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect NNN's business and financial condition; 

NNN is obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in its debt instruments that could restrict its operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment of such debt; 

NNN's ability to pay dividends in the future is subject to many factors; 

Future issuances of NNN's equity securities could dilute the interest of NNN's common stockholders; 

Owning real estate and indirect interests in real estate carries inherent risks; 

NNN's real estate investments are illiquid; 

NNN may be subject to known or unknown environmental liabilities and risks, including but not limited to liabilities and risks resulting from the existence of hazardous materials on or under Properties owned by NNN; 

21 

NNN's failure to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes could result in significant tax liability; 

Compliance with REIT requirements, including distribution requirements, may limit NNN's flexibility and may negatively affect NNN's operating decisions; 

The share ownership restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for REITs and the 9.8 share ownership limit in NNN's charter may inhibit market activity in NNN's shares of stock and restrict NNN's business combination opportunities; 

Costs of complying with changes in governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect NNN's results of operations; 

Non-compliance with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and similar state and local laws could have an adverse effect on NNN's business and operating results; 

NNN's loss of key management personnel could adversely affect performance and the value of its securities; 

NNN's failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and the market value of NNN's securities; 

An epidemic or pandemic (such as the outbreak and worldwide spread of a novel strain of coronavirus, and its variants ("COVID-19")), and the measures that international, federal, state and local governments, agencies, law enforcement and/or health authorities implement to address it, may precipitate or materially exacerbate one or more of the other risks, and may significantly disrupt NNN's tenants' ability to operate their businesses and/or pay rent to NNN or prevent NNN from operating its business in the ordinary course for an extended period; 

Acts of violence, terrorist attacks or war may affect NNN's Properties, the markets in which NNN operates and NNN's results of operations; 

Changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely impact NNN's or NNN's tenants' reported financial performance; 

The market value of NNN's equity and debt securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility; 

Even if NNN remains qualified as a REIT, NNN faces other tax liabilities that reduce operating results and cash flow; and 

Adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes could reduce NNN's earnings and cash flow and the market value of NNN's securities. 

Additional information related to these risks and uncertainties are included in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of NNN's 2023 Annual Report. 
 These risks and uncertainties may cause NNN's actual future results to differ materially from expected results. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Overview 
 NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated REIT formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment ("Properties" or "Property Portfolio", or individually a "Property"). 
 As of September 30, 2024, NNN owned 3,549 Properties in 49 states, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 36,550,000 square feet, and a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.0 years. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of September 30, 2024. 
 NNN's management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, line of trade and geographic diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance metrics and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. 
 22 

NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its significant current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its significant tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. 
 NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, line of trade and geography. NNN's largest line of trade concentrations are the automotive service (16.8 ), restaurant (including full and limited service) (16.7 and convenience store (15.9 sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN's management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the southeast (26.2 and south (23.2 United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Property Portfolio remained approximately 99 percent leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 10 years. High occupancy levels coupled with a triple-net lease structure, provides enhanced probability of achieving consistent earnings. 
 Additional information related to NNN and the Property Portfolio is included in NNN's 2023 Annual Report.

General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in amount; however, remained relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs. 
 Real Estate. Total real estate expenses increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. However, NNN focuses on non-reimbursed real estate expenses (total real estate expenses, net of reimbursements from tenants). These expenses are typically attributable to (i) Properties for which the lease terms do not obligate the tenant to pay certain operating expenses or (ii) vacant Properties. Non-reimbursed real estate expenses remained relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is primarily due to the increase in NNN's Property Portfolio from recent acquisitions (see "Results of Operations Property Analysis Property Acquisitions"), and is partially offset by recent dispositions (see "Results of Operations Property Analysis Property Dispositions"). 
 Impairment Losses Real Estate, Net of Recoveries. As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which were less than one percent of NNN's total assets for the respective periods as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to NNN's core business of investing in real estate leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases, the inherent risks of owning commercial real estate, and unknown potential changes in financial and economic conditions that may impact NNN's tenants, NNN believes it is reasonably possible to incur real estate impairment charges in the future. 
 26 

Interest Expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The following represents the primary changes in fixed rate long-term debt that impacted interest expense (dollars in thousands):

The increase in interest expense was partially offset by the Credit Facility having a weighted average outstanding balance of 75,769,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 6.28 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a weighted average outstanding balance of 201,296,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.79 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 NNN's demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and dividends, (ii) property acquisitions and construction commitments, (iii) capital expenditures, (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness, and (v) other investments. 
 Financing Strategy. NNN's financing objective is to manage its capital structure effectively in order to provide sufficient capital to execute its operating strategy while servicing its debt requirements, maintaining its investment grade credit rating, staggering debt maturities and providing value to NNN's stockholders. NNN's capital resources have and will continue to include, if available (i) proceeds from issuing debt or equity in the capital markets; (ii) secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders; (iii) proceeds from the sale of Properties; and (iv) to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds as well as undistributed funds from operations. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to NNN. 
 NNN typically expects to fund both its short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including investments in additional properties, with cash and cash equivalents, cash provided from operations, borrowings from NNN's Credit Facility or proceeds from the sale of Properties. As of September 30, 2024, NNN had 178,512,000 of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash or cash held in escrow and 1,200,000,000 available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. NNN may also fund liquidity requirements with new debt or equity issuances, although newly issued debt may be at higher interest rates than the rates on NNN's existing outstanding debt. NNN has the ability to limit future property acquisitions and strategically increase property dispositions. NNN expects these sources of liquidity and the discretionary nature of its property acquisition funding needs will allow NNN to meet its financial obligations over the long term. 
 Cash Flows. NNN had 178,512,000 of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, of which 4,986,000 was restricted cash or cash held in escrow at September 30, 2024. The table below summarizes NNN's cash flows (dollars in thousands):

Cash flow activities include: 
 Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from rental income and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN's cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in Results of Operations. Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. 
 Investing Activities. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties as discussed in "Results of Operations Property Analysis." NNN typically uses cash on hand, borrowings from its Credit Facility or proceeds from the sale of Properties to fund the acquisition of its Properties. 
 Financing Activities. NNN's financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included the following significant transactions: 
 132,000,000 in net repayments of NNN's Credit Facility, 

489,390,000 in net proceeds from the issuance in May of the 5.500 notes payable due in June 2034, 

350,000,000 payment in June for the redemption of the 3.900 notes payable due in June 2024, 

211,727,000 from the issuance of 4,652,100 shares of common stock in connection with the at-the-market equity program ("ATM"), 

1,988,000 from the issuance of 49,352 shares of common stock in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ("DRIP"), and 

311,920,000 in dividends paid to common stockholders. 

Material Cash Requirements 
 NNN's material cash requirements include (i) long-term debt maturities; (ii) interest on long-term debt; (iii) common stock dividends (although all future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors); and (iv) to a lesser extent, Property construction and other Property related costs that may arise. 
 The table below presents material cash requirements related to NNN's long-term obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2024 (see "Capital Structure") (dollars in thousands):

Property Construction. NNN has committed to fund construction on 16 Properties. The improvements of such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 to 18 months. These construction commitments, at September 30, 2024, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): 

Total commitment (1)

Less amount funded 

(118,820) 

Remaining commitment 

58,572 

(1) 
 Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs, capitalized interest and third-party costs. 

Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN's cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its Credit Facility, debt or equity financings and property dispositions. 
 Properties. Typically, the Properties are leased under long-term triple-net leases, which require the tenant to pay all utilities and real estate taxes and assessments, to maintain the interior and exterior of the Property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its Credit Facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures or major repairs. 
 The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or the inability to collect lease payments could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. 
 As of September 30, 2024, NNN owned 24 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for less than one percent of total Properties, and approximately one percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio. 
 Additionally, as of October 28, 2024, 0.7 percent of total annualized base rent, 1.0 percent of total Properties and 1.8 percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to two tenants currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, these tenants have the right to reject or affirm their leases with NNN. 
 NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. 
 Dividends. One of NNN's primary objectives is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends, while retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT. 
 The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for NNN's common stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data):

Line of Credit Payable. In April 2024, NNN amended and restated its credit agreement to increase borrowing capacity under its unsecured revolving credit facility from 1,100,000,000 to 1,200,000,000 and amended certain other terms under the former revolving credit facility (as the context requires, the previous and new revolving credit facility, the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of 75,769,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 6.28 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Credit Facility has a base interest rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus a SOFR adjustment of 10 basis points ("Adjusted SOFR"). The Credit Facility bears interest at Adjusted SOFR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance ("ESG") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility matures in April 2028, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to April 2029. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to 2,000,000,000, subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, loan costs are classified as debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, there was no amount outstanding and 1,200,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the Credit Facility financial covenants. 
 Universal Shelf Registration Statement. In August 2023, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") which became automatically effective ("Universal Shelf"). The Universal Shelf permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities, including preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, stock purchase contracts, rights, warrants and units.

(1) 
 The proceeds from each note issuance were used to (i) pay down the outstanding balance on NNN's Credit Facility, (ii) redeem notes payable prior to maturity, (iii) redeem outstanding preferred stock, (iv) fund future property acquisitions, and/or (v) for general corporate purposes. 

(2) 
 The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method. 

(3) 
 Includes the effects of the discount at issuance. 

(4) 
 NNN entered into forward starting swaps which hedged the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of a series of unsecured notes, NNN terminated such derivatives, and the resulting fair value was deferred in other comprehensive income. The deferred liability (asset) is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. 

(5) 
 The aggregate principal balance of the unsecured note maturities for the next five years is 1,550,000. 

Each series of the notes represents senior, unsecured obligations of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN. NNN may redeem each series of notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the par call date for the notes at the redemption price as set forth in the applicable supplemental indenture relating to the notes; provided, however, that if NNN redeems the notes on or after the par call date, the redemption price will equal 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. 
 In connection with the outstanding debt offerings, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling 43,820,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and presented as a reduction to notes payable and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. 
 In accordance with the terms of the indentures, pursuant to which NNN's notes have been issued, NNN is required to meet certain restrictive financial covenants, which, among other things, require NNN to maintain (i) certain leverage ratios and (ii) certain interest coverage. At September 30, 2024, NNN was in compliance with those covenants.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2024, NNN filed a shelf registration statement for its DRIP with the Commission that was automatically effective, and permits NNN to issue up to 4,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN's DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN's common stock.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The preparation of NNN's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as other disclosures in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Estimates are sensitive to evaluations by management about current and future expectations of market and economic conditions. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on NNN's consolidated financial statements. A summary of NNN's critical accounting estimates is included in NNN's 2023 Annual Report. NNN has not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 32 

Item 3. Quantitative and Q ualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate long-term debt which is used to finance NNN's Property acquisitions and development activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN's interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt and periodically uses derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk of future borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, NNN had no outstanding derivatives. 
 As of September 30, 2024, NNN's variable rate Credit Facility had no amount outstanding and a weighted average outstanding balance of 75,769,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 6.28 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a weighted average outstanding balance of 201,296,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.79 for the same period in 2023. 
 The information in the table below summarizes NNN's market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding. The table presents, by year of expected maturity, principal payments and related interest rates for debt obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of September 30, 2024, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN's ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN's hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by less than one percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting and Technology Officer ("NNN's Chief Officers"), of the effectiveness as of September 30, 2024, of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, NNN's Chief Officers concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
