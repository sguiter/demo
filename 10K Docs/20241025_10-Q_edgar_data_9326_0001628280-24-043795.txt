 As allowed by ASC 718, the Company has made an estimate of expected forfeitures based on its historical experience and is recognizing compensation cost only for those stock-based compensation awards expected to vest. 
 The Company's omnibus incentive plan ("the Plan") allows for the granting of stock awards and options to purchase common stock. Both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options can be awarded under the plan. No option will be exercisable for longer than after the date of grant. The Company has approved and reserved a number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the outstanding options that is adequate to cover all exercises. As of September 30, 2024, the Plan had shares available for future awards, which included an additional shares approved by the Company's shareholders during its annual meeting of shareholders held on June 22, 2023. Compensation expense for stock options and stock awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, generally three to for stock options, for employee restricted stock awards, for employee performance share awards, and for non-employee director restricted stock awards. Certain awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as defined in the plans) or other qualifying events.

Expense is estimated based on the number of shares expected to vest, assuming the requisite service period is rendered and the probable outcome of the performance condition is achieved. The estimate is revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of shares likely to vest differs from previous estimates. Expense is ultimately adjusted based on the actual achievement of service and performance targets. The PS will cliff vest at the end of the third year following the grant in accordance with the performance metrics set forth. Grants may be subject to a mandatory holding period of from the vesting date. For PS grants made for the 2024-2026 performance period, grants are subject to such holding period.

 Repurchase of Common Stock 
 shares. Since the inception of the program in June 1999, a total of shares have been repurchased. The Company intends to acquire shares from time to time at prevailing market prices if and to the extent it deems it is advisable to do so based on its assessment of corporate cash flow, market conditions and other factors. Open market repurchases of common stock could be made pursuant to a trading plan established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would permit common stock to be repurchased at a time that the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or self-imposed trading restrictions. The Company also repurchases (withholds) shares from employees in connection with the tax settlement of vested shares and/or exercised stock options under the Company's omnibus incentive plan. Such repurchases of shares from employees are funded with existing cash on hand. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company purchased and shares, respectively, from employees in connection with the tax settlement of vested shares and/or exercised stock options under the Company's omnibus incentive plan at an average cost of and , respectively.

 / ownership), St. Gabriel CC Company, LLC, to design, develop, and construct an expansion of the Company s St. Gabriel aqueous choline chloride plant. The Company contributed the St. Gabriel plant, at cost, and all continued expansion and improvements are funded by the owners. The joint venture became operational as of July 1, 2016. St. Gabriel CC Company, LLC is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) because the total equity at risk is not sufficient to permit the joint venture to finance its own activities without additional subordinated financial support. Additionally, voting rights votes each) are not proportionate to the owners obligation to absorb expected losses or receive the expected residual returns of the joint venture. The Company generally receives up to 2/3 of the production offtake capacity, which (percentage of offtake) may be adjusted from time to time to the extent the owners agree as such, and absorbs operating expenses approximately proportional to the actual percentage of offtake. The joint venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting since the Company is not the primary beneficiary as the Company does not have the power to direct the activities of the joint venture that most significantly impact its economic performance. The Company recognized a loss of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, relating to its portion of the joint venture's expenses in other expense. The Company made capital contributions to the investment totaling and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 of borrowing. The loans may be used for working capital, letters of credit, and other corporate purposes and may be drawn upon at the Company s discretion. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total balance outstanding on the 2022 Credit Agreement amounted to and , respectively. There are installment payments required on the revolving loans; they may be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part without premium or penalty, and all outstanding amounts are due on the maturity date. 
 Amounts outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement are subject to an interest rate equal to a fluctuating rate as defined by the 2022 Credit Agreement plus an applicable rate. The applicable rate is based upon the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement, and the interest rate was at September 30, 2024. The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan, which is based on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement and ranges from to at September 30, 2024). The unused portion of the revolving loan amounted to at September 30, 2024. The Company is also required to pay, as applicable, letter of credit fees, administrative agent fees, and other fees to the arrangers and lenders. 
 Costs associated with the issuance of the revolving loans are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the 2022 Credit Agreement, which is not materially different than the effective interest method. Capitalized costs net of accumulated amortization were and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in "Other non-current assets" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense pertaining to these costs totaled and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and are included in "Interest expense, net" in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of earnings. 
 The 2022 Credit Agreement contains quarterly covenants requiring the consolidated leverage ratio to be less than a certain maximum ratio and the consolidated interest coverage ratio to exceed a certain minimum ratio. At September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. Indebtedness under the Company s loan agreements is secured by assets of the Company.

 The number of anti-dilutive shares were and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Anti-dilutive shares could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in future periods and therefore, were not included in diluted earnings per share.

 and , respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower tax benefits from stock-based compensatio n and certain higher state taxes. 
 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and would establish a valuation allowance if it believed that such assets may not be recovered, taking into consideration historical operating results, expectations of future earnings, changes in its operations and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. 
 The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes utilizing ASC 740-10, "Income Taxes". ASC 740-10 clarifies whether or not to recognize assets or liabilities for tax positions taken that may be challenged by a tax authority. It prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosures. The application of ASC 740-10 requires judgment related to the uncertainty in income taxes and could impact our effective tax rate. 
 The Company files income tax return s in the U.S. and in various states and foreign countries. As of September 30, 2024, in the major jurisdictions where the Company operates, it is generally no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2019. The Company had approximately and of unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in "Other long-term obligations" on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company includes interest expense or income as well as potential penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of "Income tax expense" in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. Total accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were approximately and , respectively, and are included in "Other long-term obligations" on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the specified contractual obligations set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We expect our operations to continue generating sufficient cash flow to fund working capital requirements and necessary capital investments.

 We have an approved stock repurchase program. The total authorization under this program is 3,763,038 shares. Since the inception of the program in June 1999, a total of 3,140,215 shares have been purchased. We intend to acquire shares from time to time at prevailing market prices if and to the extent we deem it is advisable to do so based on our assessment of corporate cash flow, market conditions and other factors. Open market repurchases of common stock could be made pursuant to a trading plan established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would permit common stock to be repurchased at a time that we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or self-imposed trading restrictions. We also purchase (withhold) shares from employees in connection with the tax settlement of vested shares and/or exercised stock options under the Company's omnibus incentive plan. Share repurchases are funded with existing cash on hand. 
 Proceeds from stock options exercised were 15,084 and 3,888 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Dividend payments were 25,572 and 22,872 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Other Matters Impacting Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, w e have a liability of 4,825 and 4,650, respectively, for uncertain tax positions, including the related interest and penalties, recorded in accordance with ASC 740-10, for which we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement, if any. 
 We currently provide postretirement benefits in the form of two retirement medical plans, as discussed in Note 14, Employee Benefit Plans . The liabilities recorded in "Other long-term obligations" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 1,381 and 1,395, respectively, and the plans are not funded. Historical cash payments made under these plans have typically been less than 200 per year. We do not anticipate any changes to the payments made in the current year for the plans. 
 Chemogas has an unfunded defined benefit plan. The plan provides for the payment of a lump sum at retirement or payments in case of death of the covered employees. The amounts recorded for this obligation on our balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 405 and 420, respectively, and was included in "Other long-term obligations" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 We provide an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees. Assets of the plan are held in a rabbi trust and are subject to additional risk of loss in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. The deferred compensation liability as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 11,432 and 10,188, respectively, and was included in "Other long-term obligations" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The related rabbi trust assets were 11,429 and 10,188 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and were included in "Other non-current assets" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in checking accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market investment funds. In 2019, we entered into an interest rate swap and cross-currency swap for hedging purposes. This derivative settled on its maturity date of June 27, 2023. Re fer to details noted above (see Note 19, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ). Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, our borrowings were under a revolving loan bearing interest at a fluctuating rate as defined by the 2022 Credit Agreement plus an applicable rate (See Note 7 , Revolving Loan ). The applicable rate is based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, applied to our borrowings at September 30, 2024, would result in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense and a corresponding reduction or increase in cash flow of approxi mately 2,270. We are exposed to commodity price risks, including prices of our primary raw materials. Our objective is to seek a reduction i n the potential negative earnings impact of raw material pricing arising in our business activities. We manage these financial exposures, where possible, through pricing and operational means. Our practices may change as economic conditions change. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates, including the interest rate relating to the 2022 Credit Agreement. In the second quarter of 2019, we began to manage our interest rate exposure through the use of derivative instruments. These derivatives were utilized for risk management purposes, and were not used for trading or speculative purposes. We hedged a portion of our floating interest rate exposure using an interest rate swap (see Note 19, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ), which settled on its maturity date of June 27, 2023. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 
 The financial condition and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are reported in local currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to these currencies. In 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap, with a notional amount of 108,569, which we designated as a hedge of our net investment in Chemogas (see Note 19, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ). This derivative settled on its maturity date of June 27, 2023.

Part II. Other Information

 In the normal course of business, we are involved in a variety of lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings, from time to time, including commercial and contract disputes, labor and employment matters, product liability claims, environmental liabilities, trade regulation matters, intellectual property disputes and tax-related matters. Further, in connection with normal operations at our plant facilities, our manufacturing sites may, from time to time, be subject to inspections or inquiries by the EPA and other agencies.
