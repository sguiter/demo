 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

NOTE 1 - 
 business segment. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company discontinued the Bank s nationwide residential mortgage loan segment. The operations of this segment are reported as discontinued operations. 
 In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring items, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements for the interim periods have been included. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. These reclassifications did not have a material effect on previously reported net income, shareholders equity, or cash flows. 
 Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 in the Company s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. For interim reporting purposes, the Company follows the same basic accounting policies and considers each interim period as an integral part of an annual period. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status: The Company is expected to remain an "emerging growth company," as defined in the JOBS Act, through December 31, 2026. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period when complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means these financial statements, as well as financial statements they file in the future for as long as the Company remains an emerging growth company, will be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to private companies.

 No ACL for investment securities AFS was needed at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Declines in the fair value of the AFS investment portfolio are believed by management to be unrelated to credit losses. When evaluating an investment for credit loss, management considers, among other things, the financial condition of the issuer through the review of credit ratings and, if necessary, corporate financial statements; adverse conditions specifically related to the security such as past due principal or interest; underlying assets that collateralize the debt security; other economic conditions and demographics; and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the investment until the loss position is recovered. Any unrealized losses were largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time of purchase. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach their maturity date or market yields for the investments decline. Management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. At September 30, 2024 , the Company did not intend to sell and believed it was not likely to be required to sell the available for sale securities that were in a loss position prior to full recovery. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no past due principal and interest payments associated with the HTM securities. The Company monitors the credit quality of debt securities held to maturity quarterly through the use of credit ratings. However, the corporate bonds that are held to maturity have no credit rating and the corporate bonds in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 are not material to the financial statements. There was an ACL of and on corporate bonds HTM at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which was calculated based on applying the long-term historical credit loss rate for similarly rated securities.

 There were no transfers between levels for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis during the reported periods. 
 Financial Instruments Recorded Using Fair Value Option 
 The Company also elected the fair value option for certain of its government guaranteed loans HFI as the Company believed that fair value was the best indicator of the resolution of those loans at that time. Depending on market conditions and liquidity needs of the Company, management determines whether it is advantageous to hold or sell government guaranteed loans on a loan-by-loan basis. The portion of these loans guaranteed by the government are generally readily marketable in the secondary market and the portion of the loans that are not guaranteed may be sold periodically to other third party financial institutions. Interest income on these loans is recorded based on the contractual term of the loan and in accordance with the Company s policy on other loans HFI.

 Balance of government guaranteed loans HFI at fair value, end of period 
 
 The Company s valuation of government guaranteed loans HFI, at fair value, was supported by an analysis prepared by an independent third party and approved by management. The approach to determine fair value involved several steps: 1) identifying each loan s unique characteristics, including balance, payment type, term, coupon, age, and principal and interest payment; 2) projecting these loan level characteristics for the life of each loan; and 3) performing discounted cash flow modeling.

 The significant unobservable inputs impacting the fair value measurement of government guaranteed loans HFI, at fair value, include discount rates and conditional prepayment rates. Increases in discount rates or prepayment rates would result in a lower fair value measurement. Although the prepayment rate and discount rate are not directly interrelated, they generally move in opposite directions. The discount rates and conditional prepayment rates were weighted by the relative principal balance outstanding of these loans.

 Stock Options 
 The Equity Plan permits the grant of stock options to the Company s employees and non-employee directors for up to of the total number of shares of Company common stock issued and outstanding, up to shares. Option awards are 
 granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company s common stock at the date of grant. The market price of the Company s common stock is the closing sales price of the Common Stock on Nasdaq on the date of the grant. Those option awards generally have a vesting period of years for employees and years for non-employee directors and have contractual terms. 
 The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form option valuation (Black-Scholes) model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatility is based on an average of historical volatility of peer financial institutions. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes into account that the options are not transferable. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion is an analysis of the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. 
 In addition to the historical information contained herein, this Form 10-Q includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of such term in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of health crises, global military hostilities, weather events, or climate changes, including its effects on the economic environment, its customers and its operations, as well as any changes to federal, state or local government laws, regulations or orders in connection with them; the ability of the Company to implement its strategy and expand its banking operations; changes in interest rates and other general economic, business and political conditions, including changes in the financial markets or global military hostilities; changes in business plans as circumstances warrant; risks related to mergers and acquisitions; changes in benchmark interest rates used to price loans and deposits, changes in tax laws, regulations and guidance; and other risks detailed from time to time in filings made by the Company with the SEC. Readers should note that the forward-looking statements included herein are not a guarantee of future events, and that actual events may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. 
 Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "will," "propose," "may," "plan," "seek," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "believe," "continue," or similar terminology. Any forward-looking statements presented herein are made only as of the date of this document, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events, or otherwise. 
 
 Overview 
 The following discussion and analysis presents the financial condition and results of operations on a consolidated basis. However, because the Company conducts all of its material business operations through the Bank, the discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. 
 As a one-bank holding company, the Company generates most of its revenue from interest on loans and gain-on-sale income derived from the sale of government guaranteed loans into the secondary market. The primary source of funding for its loans is deposits. The Company is dependent on noninterest income, which is derived primarily from net gain on the sales of the guaranteed portion of government guaranteed loans. The largest expenses are interest on those deposits and borrowings, professional fees, loan origination expenses, and salaries and commissions plus related employee benefits. The Company measures its performance through its net interest income after provision for credit losses, return on average assets, and return on average common equity, while maintaining appropriate regulatory leverage and risk-based capital ratios. 
 
 Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases those estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances, results of which form the basis for making judgments about the 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 Accounting policies, as described in detail in the notes to the Company s consolidated financial statements, are an integral part of the Company s consolidated financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing the Company s reported results of operations and financial position. Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates listed below require the Company to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. At September 30, 2024, the most critical of these significant accounting policies in understanding the estimates and assumptions involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements were the policies related to the ACL and fair value measurement of government guaranteed loan servicing rights and government guaranteed loans HFI at fair value, which are discussed more fully in the December 31, 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Changes in these estimates that are likely to occur from period to period, or the use of different estimates that the Company could have reasonably used in the current period, could have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operation. 
 Further, the Company is an emerging growth company. The JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. This means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies do so. This may make the Company s financial statements not comparable with those of public companies which are neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

 Hurricane Recovery. Hurricane Helene struck the Florida gulf coast on September 26, 2024 and caused widespread damage from Florida to the Carolinas and eastern Tennessee. On October 9, 2024, Hurricane Milton struck the west coast of Florida and tracked across the middle of the state. Both storms caused widespread damage including flooding from storm surge, extreme winds, and substantial rainfall. 
 The Company maintained uninterrupted digital and telephone access for our customers, and having experienced minimal impact to our branch properties, the Company fully reopened to serve our communities shortly after each storm. 
 Recovery efforts in many areas continue and the full impacts on people and businesses in the most hard-hit regions are not fully known. At this time, there have been relatively few loan concessions (mostly in the form of loan payment deferrals up to 90 days) for distressed borrowers impacted by the hurricanes. However, the Company continues to assess the impact of the hurricanes on our customers. Where appropriate, we will work constructively with individual borrowers. Management is assessing the impact of both hurricanes to determine if additional provisions are warranted.

 `GAAP Reconciliation and Management Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Some of the financial measures included in this report are not measures of financial condition or performance recognized by GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include tangible common shareholders' equity and tangible book value per common share. The management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of its performance, and they believe that providing this information to financial analysts and investors allows them to evaluate capital adequacy. 
 The following presents these non-GAAP financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP:

 Results of Operations 
 BayFirst s operating results depend on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. Net interest income is determined by the difference between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities interest rate spread and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The interest rate spread is affected by regulatory, economic, and competitive factors which influence interest rates, loan demand, and deposit flows. In addition, the Company s operating results can be affected by the level of nonperforming assets, as well as the level of the noninterest income and the noninterest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, and loan origination expenses as well as income taxes. 
 The Company is dependent on noninterest income, which is derived primarily from net gain on the sales of the guaranteed portion of government guaranteed loans, as well as fair value adjustments for certain loans which management has elected the fair value option. While the Company retains some of its government guaranteed loans on the balance sheet, the Company may sell both the guaranteed balance of its government guaranteed loans, as well as a percentage of the unguaranteed portions of such loans. 
 In the second quarter of 2022, the Bank discontinued its primary consumer direct residential mortgage business line. In the third quarter of 2022, management decided to discontinue the nationwide residential lending business. As a result of the 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 discontinuance, the nationwide residential line of business was reclassified as a discontinued operation and reported in the financial statements as such. 
 
 Net Income 
 
 The Company had net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 1.1 million, or 0.18 per diluted common share, compared to net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 1.9 million, or 0.41 per diluted common share. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in government guaranteed loan fair value gains of 1.1 million and a decrease in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of 1.0 million, partially offset by an increase in net interest income of 1.1 million and lower compensation expense of 0.3 million. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 2.8 million, or 0.40 per diluted common share, a decrease from net income of 4.0 million, or 0.83 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to higher provision for credit losses of 2.5 million, a decrease in government guaranteed fair value gains of 1.1 million, and higher noninterest expense of 2.2 million, partially offset by higher gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of 2.3 million and higher government guaranteed loan packaging fees of 1.3 million. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income from continuing operations was 9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase from 8.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to an increase in interest income of 3.8 million, partially offset by higher interest expense on deposits. 
 Net interest margin was 3.34 for the third quarter of 2024, which represented a decrease from 3.36 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Net interest income from continuing operations was 27.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease from 27.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to an increase in interest expense of 11.6 million, partially offset by an increase in interest income, including fees, of 11.4 million. 
 Net interest margin decreased to 3.39 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 3.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

 Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The table below presents the effects of volume and rate changes on interest income and expense for the periods indicated. Changes in volume are changes in the average balance multiplied by the previous period s average rate. Changes in rate are changes in the average rate multiplied by the average balance from the previous period. The net changes attributable to the combined impact of both rate and volume have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate. Loans in nonaccrual status, for the purpose of the following computations, are included in the average loan balances. FRB, FHLB, and FNBB restricted equity holdings are included in other interest-earning assets. The Company did not have a significant amount of tax-exempt assets.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses is charged to operations to adjust the total allowance to a level deemed appropriate by management and is based upon the volume and type of lending the Bank conducts, industry standards, the amount of nonperforming loans, general economic conditions, particularly as they relate to its market area, economic forecasts, and other factors that may affect the ability to collect on the loans in its portfolio. 
 
 The Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 3.1 million primarily due to net charge-offs and net loan growth. This compared to a provision of 3.0 million for the three 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, 2.8 million of net charge offs in loans were recorded compared to 2.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 T he Company recorded a provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 10.2 million compared to a 7.7 million provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 2.5 million in the provision for credit losses expense was primarily due to higher than expected charge-offs resulting in higher provision expense based on ACL model output . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loan charge offs totaled 9.7 million compared to 6.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Bank developed an express modification program for SBA 7(a) borrowers to help those borrowers who are challenged with larger payments in the higher interest rate environment compared to interest rates at the time the loans were originated. Through September 30, 2024, approximately 400 SBA 7(a) borrowers have been offered loan modification options. These efforts have helped and are expected to continue to help reduce net charge-offs. 
 The ACL was 14.2 million at September 30, 2024 and 13.4 million at September 30, 2023.

 Loan Portfolio Composition 
 The Company offers a variety of products designed to meet the credit needs of our borrowers. Our lending activities primarily consist of government guaranteed, commercial real estate, commercial business, residential mortgage, and consumer loans. Senior management and loan officers have continued to develop new sources of loan referrals, particularly among centers of local influence and real estate professionals, and have also enjoyed repeat business from loyal customers in the markets the Bank serves. The Bank has no concentration of credit in any industry that represents 10 or more of its loan portfolio. Additionally, the l oan portfolio is well-diversified across major loan types with a low concentration of non owner-occupied commercial real estate loans which makes up 6 of the total portfolio. The following table sets forth the composition of its loan portfolio, including LHFS as of the dates indicated.

 Credit Risk 
 The Bank s primary business is making commercial, consumer, and real estate loans. This activity inevitably has risks for potential credit losses, the magnitude of which depends on a variety of economic factors affecting borrowers, which are beyond its control. The Bank has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of its credit portfolio and the timely identification of potential problem loans. Management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is based upon a number of assumptions about the economic environment that it believes impacts credit quality as of the balance sheet date that it believes to be reasonable, but which may or may not prove accurate. Thus, there can be no assurance that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the ACL, or that additional increases in the ACL will not be required. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. In accordance with changes in generally accepted accounting principles, the Company adopted the new credit loss accounting standard known as CECL on January 1, 2023. At the time of adoption, the ACL for loans increased by 3.1 million to 1.73 of loans, the reserve on unfunded commitments increased 213 thousand, and an 18 thousand reserve was established for held to maturity investment securities . These one-time increases resulted in an after tax decrease to capital of 2.5 million, with no impact to earnings. Under CECL, the ACL is based on expected credit losses rather than on incurred losses. 
 The Bank must maintain an adequate ACL based on a comprehensive methodology that assesses the probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio. The Bank maintains an ACL based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including levels and trends of past due and nonaccrual loans, asset classifications, change in volume and mix of loans, collateral value, historical loss experience, size and complexity of individual credits, and economic conditions. In addition to this, t he Company uses reasonable and supportable forecasts that are developed with internal and external data. These 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 are updated quarterly by management and utilize data from the FOMC s median forecasts of change in national GDP and of national unemployment. Provisions for credit losses are provided on both a specific and general basis. Specific allowances are provided for individual loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with instruments evaluated using a collective (pooled) basis. General valuation allowances are determined by loan pools with a further evaluation of various quantitative and qualitative factors noted above. 
 The Bank periodically reviews the assumptions and formulates methodologies by which changes are made to the specific and general valuation ACL in an effort to refine such allowances in light of the current status of the factors described above. 
 All nonaccrual loans and modifications to loans for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are reviewed to determine if the loans share the same risk characteristics as the pooled loans. If the loan does not share the same risk characteristics, the loan is evaluated individually for credit losses. Specific allocation of reserves for individually evaluated loans considers the value of the collateral, the financial condition of the borrower, and industry and current economic trends. The Bank reviews the collateral value, cash flow, and other support on each individually evaluated credit. Any deficiency outlined by a real estate collateral evaluation analysis, or cash flow shortfall, is accounted for through a specific allocation for the loan. 
 Nonperforming Assets . At September 30, 2024, the Company had 12.5 million in nonperforming assets, excluding government guaranteed loan balances, and the ACL represented 1.48 of total loans HFI at amortized cost. At September 30, 2023, the Company had 8.4 million in nonperforming assets, excluding government guaranteed loan balances, and their ACL represented 1.68 of total loans HFI at amortized cost. Total loans HFI at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 included government guaranteed loans and loans measured at fair value, which had no reserves allocated to them. ACL as a percentage of loans HFI at amortized cost, not including government guaranteed loan balances, was 1.70 at September 30, 2024, compared to 2.03 at September 30, 2023. 
 The following table sets forth certain information on nonaccrual loans, loans 90 days or more past due, and foreclosed assets, the ratio of such loans and foreclosed assets to total assets as of the dates indicated, and certain other related information.

 Deposits 
 General. In addition to deposits, sources of funds available for lending and for other purposes include loan repayments and proceeds from the sales of loans. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are influenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions. Borrowings, as well as available lines of credit, may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources, such as deposits at less than projected levels. 
 Deposits. Deposits are sourced principally from within its primary service area of Pinellas, Hillsborough, Manatee, Pasco, and Sarasota Counties, Florida. The Bank offers a wide selection of deposit instruments including demand deposit accounts, NOW accounts, money-market accounts, regular savings accounts, time deposit accounts, and retirement savings plans (such as IRA accounts). 
 Time deposit rates are set to encourage longer maturities as cost and market conditions will allow. Deposit account terms vary, with the primary differences being the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate. 
 The Bank emphasizes commercial banking relationships in an effort to increase demand deposits as a percentage of total deposits. Deposit interest rates are set by management at least monthly or more often if conditions require it, based on a review of loan demand, recent cash flows and a survey of rates among competitors. 
 Brokered deposits . At times, the Bank has brokered time deposit and non-maturity deposit relationships available to diversify its funding sources. Brokered deposits offer several benefits relative to other funding sources, such as: maturity structures which cannot be duplicated in the current retail market, deposit gathering outside the market of the existing deposit base, the unsecured nature of these liabilities, and the ability to quickly generate funds. The Bank s internal policy limits the use of brokered deposits as a funding source to no more than 15 of total assets. The Company's ability to accept or renew brokered deposits is contingent upon the Bank maintaining a capital level of "well capitalized." At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 76.9 million and 30.0 million, respectively, of brokered deposits.

 Other Borrowings 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had 10.0 million of borrowings at 5.07 from the FHLB and no borrowings from the FRB. There was 10.0 million of borrowings at 5.57 from the FHLB and no borrowings from the FRB at December 31, 2023. 
 The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, which provides short- and long-term funding collateralized by mortgage-related assets to its members. FHLB short-term borrowings be ar interest at variable rates set by the FHLB. Any a dvances that the bank were to obtain would be secured by a blanket lien on 331.9 million of real estate-related loans as of September 30, 2024. Based on this collateral and the Company's holdings of FHLB stock, the Company was eligible to borrow up to 170.7 million from the FHLB at September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, the Bank has a line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta which was secured by 60.8 million of commercial loans as of September 30, 2024. FRB short-term borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on the FOMC's target range for the federal funds rate. Based on this collateral, the Company was eligible to borrow up to 43.0 million from the FRB at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company has 6.0 million of Subordinated Debentures (the Debentures that mature June 30, 2031 and are redeemable after 5 years which is June 30, 2026. The Debentures carry interest at a fixed rate of 4.50 per annum for the initial 5 years of term and carry interest at a floating rate for the final 5 years of term after June 30, 2026. Under the debt agreements, the floating rates are based on a SOFR benchmark plus 3.78 per annum. The balance of Subordinated Debentures outstanding at the Company, net of offering costs, amounted to 6.0 million and 5.9 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company has a term note with quarterly principal and interest payments with interest at Prime (8.50 at September 30, 2024). The note matures on March 10, 2029 and the balance of the note was 2.0 million and 2.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The note is secured by 100 of the stock of the Company and requires the Company to comply with certain loan covenants during the term of the note. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial debt covenants. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 Shareholders' equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, the Company's sales and repurchases of its common and preferred stock, and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, on available for sale investment securities. 
 Shareholders' equity was 102.3 million at September 30, 2024 as compared to 100.7 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to net income of 2.8 million and a decrease in other comprehensive loss of 0.7 million, partially offset by common stock dividends of 1.0 million and preferred stock dividends of 1.2 million. 
 The Company strives to maintain an adequate capital base to support its activities in a safe and sound manner while at the same time attempting to maximize shareholder value. Management assesses capital adequacy against the risk inherent in 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 the balance sheet, recognizing that unexpected loss is the common denominator of risk and that common equity has the greatest capacity to absorb unexpected loss. 
 The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by various regulatory agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on BayFirst s and the Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank's capital ratios were in excess of the requirement to be "well capitalized" under the regulatory guidelines. 
 As of the dates indicated, the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. The Bank s actual capital amounts and percentages were as shown in the table below: 
 Actual Minimum (1) 
 Well Capitalized (2) 
 (Dollars in thousands) Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent As of September 30, 2024

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business. These financial instruments primarily include unfunded loan commitments, unfunded lines of credit, and standby letters of credit. The Bank uses these financial instruments to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate, and liquidity risk. These do not present unusual risks and management does not anticipate any accounting losses that would have a material effect on the Bank. 
 A summary of the amounts of the Bank s financial instruments, with off-balance sheet risk as of the dates indicated, was as follows: 
 (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Unfunded loan commitments 
 79,412 7,392 Unused lines of credit 
 200,109 178,440 Standby letters of credit 
 211 186 Total 
 279,732 186,018 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Management evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 
 Standby letters-of-credit are conditional lending commitments that the Bank issues to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and to support private borrowing arrangements. Essentially, letters of credit have expiration dates within one year of the issue date. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending credit. The Bank may hold collateral supporting those commitments. 
 In general, loan commitments and letters of credit are made on the same terms, including with respect to collateral, as outstanding loans. Each customer s creditworthiness and the collateral required are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 
 The Company maintains an ACL for its off-balance sheet loan commitments which is calculated by loan type using estimated line utilization rates based on historical usage. Loss rates for outstanding loans is applied to the estimated utilization rates to calculate the ACL for off-balance sheet loan commitments. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ACL for off-balance sheet loan commitments totaled 664 thousand and 839 thousand, respectively. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 In the ordinary course of its operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations. Total contractual obligations at September 30, 2024 were 333.3 million, an increase from 280.7 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in time deposits of 54.0 million. 
 The following tables present our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Contractual Obligations as of September 30, 2024 
 (Dollars in thousands) Less than One Year One to Three Years Three to Five Years Over Five Years Total Operating lease obligations 833 1,517 2,350 Short-term borrowings 10,000 10,000 Long-term borrowings 456 912 680 2,048 Subordinated notes 5,954 5,954 Time deposits 241,397 69,388 2,196 312,981 Total 252,686 71,817 2,876 5,954 333,333 Contractual Obligations as of December 31, 2023

 Liquidity 
 Liquidity management is the process by which the Bank manages the flow of funds necessary to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities. These financial commitments include withdrawals by depositors, credit commitments to borrowers, expenses of the operations, and capital expenditures. The Bank generally maintains a minimum liquidity ratio of liquid assets to total assets of at least 7.0 . Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks and unencumbered investment securities available for sale. The on-balance sheet liquidity ratio at September 30, 2024 was 8.62 , as compared to 9.33 at December 31, 2023. 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 For the first nine months of 2024, the Bank paid dividends of 2.80 million to BayFirst in order to meet liquidity needs to make interest payments on its debt obligations, dividends on shares of its preferred stock and common stock, and payment of operating expenses. As of September 30, 2024, BayFirst Financial Corp. held 489 thousand in cash and cash equivalents. 
 The Company expects that all the liquidity needs, including the contractual commitments can be met by currently available liquid assets and cash flows. In the event any unforeseen demand or commitments were to occur, the Company could access the borrowing capacity with the FHLB or FRB, or lines of credit with other financial institutions. The Company does not rely on investment securities as the main source of liquidity and does not foresee the need to sell investment securities for cash flow purposes. In addition, the Company has the ability to obtain wholesale deposits as another source of liquidity. The Company expects that the currently available liquid assets and the ability to borrow from the FHLB, FRB, and other financial institutions would be sufficient to satisfy the liquidity needs without any material adverse effect on the Company s liquidity. 
 A description of BayFirst s and the Bank s debt obligations is set forth above under the heading Other Borrowings. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Market risk arises primarily from interest-rate risk inherent in lending and deposit taking activities. To that end, the Company actively monitors and manages its interest-rate risk exposure. The measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on- and off-balance sheet transactions are aggregated, and the resulting net positions are identified. Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments, which reflect changes in market prices and rates, should also be considered. 
 The objective in managing interest-rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital, while adjusting the asset-liability structure to obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure. The Company relies primarily on its asset-liability structure to control interest rate risk. A sudden or substantial change in interest rates may impact its earnings, to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same rate, to the same extent, or on the same basis. 
 The Company established a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy which is administered by management s Asset-Liability Committee. The policy establishes risk limits, which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income (net interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity capital (economic value of equity at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for maturities from one day to 30 years. Management measures the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on its short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity with computer-generated simulation analysis. The simulation model is designed to capture call features and interest rate caps and floors embedded in investment and loan contracts. As with any method of analyzing interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used. When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in modeling. The methodology does not measure the impact that higher rates may have on borrowers ability to service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan and deposit products. 
 To minimize the potential for adverse effects of changes in interest rates on the results of the operations, the Company monitors assets and liabilities to better match the maturities and repricing terms of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. To do this, the Company (i) emphasizes the origination of adjustable-rate and variable-rate loans to be HFI; (ii) maintains a stable core deposit base; and (iii) maintains a significant portion of liquid assets (cash, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, and available for sale investment securities). 
 Management regularly reviews its exposure to changes in interest rates. Among the factors they consider are changes in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, interest rate spreads and repricing periods. ALCO reviews, on at least a quarterly basis, its interest rate risk position. 
 The interest rate risk position is measured and monitored at the Bank using net interest income simulation models and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis that captures both short-term and long-term interest-rate risk exposure. 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 Modeling the sensitivity of net interest income and the economic value of equity to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process. The models used for these measurements rely on estimates of the potential impact that changes in interest rates may have on the value and prepayment speeds on all components of its loan and investment portfolios, as well as embedded options and cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Balance sheet growth assumptions are also included in the simulation modeling process. The analysis provides a framework as to what the overall sensitivity position is as of the most recent reported position and the impact that potential changes in interest rates may have on net interest income and the economic value of its equity. 
 Net interest income simulation involves forecasting net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios including instantaneous shocks. 
 The estimated impact on the net interest income as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, assuming immediate parallel moves in interest rates, is presented in the table below. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change in rates Following 12 months Following 24 months Following 12 months Following 24 months +400 basis points 10.0 8.9 14.7 12.8 +300 basis points 9.8 9.7 12.7 12.1 +200 basis points 6.0 6.1 7.6 7.4 +100 basis points 1.9 2.4 2.5 2.6 -100 basis points (3.9) (4.3) (4.5) (4.5) -200 basis points (8.1) (9.0) (9.1) (9.1) 
 Management strategies may impact future reporting periods, as the actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience and the characteristics assumed, as well as changes in market conditions. Market-based prepayment speeds are factored into the analysis for loan and investment securities portfolios. Rate sensitivity for transactional deposit accounts is modeled based on both historical experience and external industry studies. 
 The Company uses economic value of equity sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of interest rate changes on long-term cash flows, income, and capital. Economic value of equity is based on discounting the cash flows for all balance sheet instruments under different interest rate scenarios. 
 The table below presents the change in the economic value of equity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, assuming immediate parallel shifts in interest rates. 
 Change in rates September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 +400 basis points (6.6) (6.3) +300 basis points (3.1) (4.1) +200 basis points (2.2) (3.3) +100 basis points (1.9) (2.7) -100 basis points (1.1) 0.2 -200 basis points (2.7) (0.3) 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Exchange Act), was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as of September 30, 2024, the last day of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to management (including the 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is named or threatened to be named as a defendant in various lawsuits, none of which is expected to have a material effect on the Company. However, given the nature, scope and complexity of the extensive legal and regulatory landscape applicable to its business (including laws and regulations governing consumer protection, fair lending, fair labor, privacy, information security, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism), the Company, like all banking organizations, is subject to heightened legal and regulatory compliance and litigation risk. There are no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the Company is a party or to which its property is the subject. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under "Part I--Item 1A--Risk Factors" in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These factors could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could cause its actual results to differ materially from its historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. 
 The development and use of artificial intelligence by us or others, or our inability to effectively and timely implement its use, may adversely affect the Company. 
 The use of artificial intelligence in the banking industry is developing and growing. Customer demand may cause us and others to offer products or services incorporating artificial intelligence. As with many developing technologies, artificial intelligence presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to invest in and use appropriate technology, which may include artificial intelligence. To effectively make such investments, we may need to expend significant financial, human, and other resources. However, we may not be able to implement artificial intelligence in an effective or timely way, thus adversely impacting our operations. This may also adversely impact our ability to compete with financial institutions which have greater resources to invest in such technological improvements. Ultimately, any artificial intelligence we develop or use may be flawed. If our use of artificial intelligence, or its use by third parties with which we do business or otherwise interact, is deficient, biased, or inaccurate, or compromises customer privacy or implicates other ethics issues, we could be subject to competitive harm, potential legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.
