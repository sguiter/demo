Contract Assets and Liabilities Under its contracts with customers, the Company stands ready to deliver product upon receipt of a purchase order. Accordingly, the Company has performance obligations under its contracts until its customers submit a purchase order. The Company does not receive pre-payment from its customers or enter into commitments to provide goods or services that have terms greater than . As the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of less than one year, the Company has applied the practical expedient under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , to omit disclosures regarding remaining performance obligations. Revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in estimated rebates and incentives impacting the transaction price) was not material in any period presented. For volume-based arrangements, the Company estimates the amount of the advanced funds earned by the retailers based on the expected volume of purchases by the retailer and amortizes the advances as a reduction of the transaction price and revenue earned. These advances are not considered contract assets under ASC 606 as they are not generated through the transfer of goods or services to the retailers. These advances are included in Other assets, net within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

days, depending on the customer. At contract inception, the Company expects that the period of time between the transfer of goods to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods will be less than one year, which is consistent with the Company s standard payment terms. Accordingly, the Company has elected the practical expedient to not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component. As a result, these amounts are recorded as receivables and not contract assets. The Company had contract assets for any period presented. The Company does not typically incur incremental costs of obtaining a contract that are contingent upon successful contract execution and would therefore be capitalized. Allowance for Credit Losses

Balance at October 5, 2024 

Within the Retail reporting unit, the Company acquired goodwill of million and an indefinite-lived trade name of million related to an immaterial acquisition during the second quarter of 2024. The Company reviews goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter of each year, and more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment is probable. Except for the impairment described in Note 5, such circumstances have not arisen in the current fiscal year. Testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment requires management to make significant estimates about the Company s future performance, cash flows, and other assumptions that can be affected by potential changes in economic, industry or market conditions, business operations, competition, or the Company s stock price and market capitalization.

(a) (b) (c) (d) million and the write-off of lease ancillary costs included in the reserve for closed properties totaling million. , the Company evaluated an indefinite-lived trade name within the Retail segment for potential impairment. The indefinite-lived trade name with a book value of million was measured at a fair value of million, resulting in an impairment charge of million. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy, as further described in Note 6. Fair value of indefinite-lived assets is determined by estimating the amount and timing of net future cash flows, discounted using a risk-adjusted rate of interest. The Company estimates future cash flows based on historical results of operations, external factors expected to impact future performance and, in the case of indefinite-lived trade name assets, estimated royalty rates. 
 Long-lived assets which are not recoverable are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy, as further described in Note 6. In the current year, assets with a book value of million were measured at a fair value of million, resulting in impairment charges of million. In the prior year, long-lived assets with a book value of million were measured at a fair value of million, resulting in impairment charges of million. The fair value of long-lived assets is determined by estimating the amount and timing of net future cash flows, including the expected proceeds from the sale of assets and expected insurance recoveries, discounted using a risk-adjusted rate of interest. The Company estimates future cash flows based on historical results of operations, external factors expected to impact future performance, experience and knowledge of the geographic area in which the assets are located, and when necessary, uses the support of real estate brokers.

Long-term debt and finance lease liabilities 

Total book value of debt instruments 

Fair value of debt instruments, excluding debt financing costs 

Excess of fair value over book value 

The estimated fair value of debt is based on market quotes for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities (Level 2 inputs and valuation techniques). The Company's interest rate swap agreement is considered a Level 2 instrument. The Company values the interest rate swap using standard models and observable market inputs including SOFR interest rates and discount rates, which are considered Level 2 inputs. The location and the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement in the condensed consolidated balance sheet is disclosed in Note 7. 

The Company performed an initial quantitative assessment of hedge effectiveness using the change-in-variable-cash-flows method. Under this method, the Company assessed the effectiveness of the hedging relationship by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the variable leg of the interest rate swap with the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest cash flows on the variable-rate debt. The Company determined the interest rate swap to be highly effective. To assess for continued hedge effectiveness, the Company performs retrospective and prospective qualitative assessments each quarter. The Company also monitors the credit risk of the counterparty on an ongoing basis. The change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is initially reported in "Other comprehensive (loss) income" in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to earnings in "Interest expense, net" in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings when the hedged transactions affect earnings.

billion in Special Financial Assistance ("SFA"), inclusive of interest, which is designed to alleviate the risk of insolvency of the Plan. On March 29, 2024, in accordance with the Pension Protection Act ("PPA"), the Plan's actuary certified that the Plan was considered to be in "critical" zone status for the plan year beginning January 1, 2024. Due to the receipt of the SFA, the Central States Plan has stated that it expects it "will be funded well into the future". Despite the expectations of the Plan, the Company views the Plan's solvency as an ongoing risk factor. Based on the most recent information available to the Company, management believes the value of assets held in trust to pay benefits covers the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in the Central States Plan. Management is not aware of any significant change in funding levels in the Plan since December 30, 2023. Due to uncertainty regarding future factors that could trigger a withdrawal liability, the Company is unable to determine with certainty the current amount of the Plan s funding and/or SpartanNash s current potential withdrawal liability exposure in the event of a future withdrawal from the Plan. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability would be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably determined. 
 million, related to the SpartanNash Retiree Medical Plan ("Retiree Medical Plan" or "Plan"). During the 12- and 40- week periods ended October 7, 2023 the Company recognized net periodic postretirement benefit income of million and million, respectively, related to the Retiree Medical Plan. The Company amended the Retiree Medical Plan on June 30, 2022. In connection with the amendment, the Company was to make lump sum cash payments to all active and retired participants in lieu of future monthly benefits and reimbursements previously offered under the Plan. As a result of the amendment effective June 30, 2022, the Plan obligation was remeasured, resulting in a reduction to the obligation of million and a corresponding prior service credit in AOCI, which was amortized to net periodic postretirement benefit income over the remaining period until the final payment was made on June 28, 2024. During the 40 week period ended October 5, 2024 , the Company recognized million in net periodic postretirement benefit income related to the amortization of the prior service credit from AOCI. During the 12- and 40- week periods ended October 7, 2023 , the Company recognized million and million, respectively, in net periodic postretirement benefit income related to the amortization of the prior service credit from AOCI.

million to all remaining active or retired participants, which constituted a final settlement of the Plan. On July 1, 2023, the Company made a lump sum payment to retired participants totaling million, which constituted a partial settlement of the Plan. The payments resulted in the recognition within net periodic postretirement expense of million and million on June 28, 2024 and July 1, 2023, respectively, related to the net actuarial loss within AOCI. The Company s retirement programs also include defined contribution plans providing contributory benefits, as well as executive compensation plans for a select group of management personnel and highly compensated associates. Multi-Employer Plans In addition to the plans listed above, the Company participates in the Central States Southeast and Southwest Pension Fund, the Michigan Conference of Teamsters and Ohio Conference of Teamsters Health and Welfare plans (collectively referred to as multi-employer plans ), and other company-sponsored defined contribution plans for most associates covered by collective bargaining agreements. With respect to the Company s participation in the Central States Plan, expense is recognized as contributions are payable. The Company s contributions during the 12- week periods ended October 5, 2024 and October 7, 2023 were each million. The Company's contributions during the 40-week periods ended October 5, 2024 and October 7, 2023 were million and 9.8 million, respectively. See Note 8 for further information regarding contingencies related to the Company s participation in the Central States Plan.

ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Fina ncial Condition and Results of Operations This Management s Discussion and Analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the information contained under the caption Forward-Looking Statements, which appears at the beginning of this report, and the information in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. Overview SpartanNash, headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is a food solutions company that delivers the ingredients for a better life. Its core businesses include distributing grocery products to a diverse group of independent and chain retailers, its corporate-owned retail stores, and U.S. military commissaries and exchanges; as well as operating a premier fresh produce distribution network and the Our Family private label brand. SpartanNash serves customer locations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Europe, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Djibouti, Korea and Japan. The Company s Wholesale segment provides a wide variety of nationally branded and its own private brand grocery products and perishable food products to independent retailers, national accounts, food service distributors, e-commerce providers, and the Company s corporate owned retail stores. The Company s Wholesale segment also distributes grocery products to 160 military commissaries and over 400 exchanges worldwide. The Company is the primary supplier of private brand products to U.S. military commissaries, a partnership with the Defense Commissary Agency ("DeCA") which began in fiscal 2017. As of the end of the third quarter, the Company s Retail segment operated 147 corporate owned retail stores in the Midwest region primarily under the banners of Family Fare, Martin s Super Markets and D W Fresh Market. The Company also offered pharmacy services in 91 of its corporate owned retail stores (81 of the pharmacies are owned by the Company), operated two pharmacy locations not associated with corporate-owned retail locations and operated 36 fuel centers. The Company s neighborhood market strategy distinguishes its corporate-owned retail stores from supercenters and limited assortment stores. All fiscal quarters are 12 weeks, except for the Company s first quarter, which is 16 weeks and will generally include the Easter holiday. The fourth quarter includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, and depending on the fiscal year end, may include the New Year s holiday. The majority of the Company s revenues are not seasonal in nature. However, in some geographies, corporate retail stores and independent retail customers are dependent on tourism, and therefore can be affected by seasons. The Company's revenues may also be impacted by weather patterns. 2024 Third Quarter Highlights Key financial and operational highlights for the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, unless otherwise noted, include the following: Net sales decreased 0.6 to 2.25 billion. Wholesale segment net sales decreased 1.6 to 1.58 billion, while Retail segment net sales increased 1.9 to 674.6 million 

 Net earnings were 0.32 per diluted share in both periods 

 Adjusted EPS of 0.48, compared to 0.54. Adjusted EBITDA of 60.5 million, compared to 60.9 million. 

 Net long-term debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.4x compared to 2.3x at the end of fiscal 2023. 

 Cash generated from operating activities of 123.3 million during the year-to-date period of fiscal 2024 compared to 95.7 million in the year-to-date period of the prior year. 

 Capital expenditures and IT capital of 106.3 million during the year-to-date period of fiscal 2024 compared to 90.3 million in the year-to-date period of the prior year. 

 Returned 37.7 million to shareholders during the year-to-date period of fiscal 2024 through 15.1 million in share repurchases and 22.6 million in dividends. 

 The Company believes that certain known or anticipated trends may cause future results to vary from historical results. The Company believes certain initiatives including both the supply chain and merchandising transformations, as well as the go-to-market strategy may favorably impact future results. The Company anticipates that additional investments in capital expenditures will be necessary to support these and other programs. Offsetting the Company's expectations of favorable future results are macroeconomic headwinds including changes in consumer demand, higher labor rates and elevated interest rates. The Company may also be exposed to other price changes such as utilities, insurance and occupancy costs.

 Net sales for the quarter ended October 5, 2024 (the third quarter decreased 13.6 million, or 0.6 , to 2.25 billion from 2.26 billion in the quarter ended October 7, 2023 (the prior year quarter ). Net sales for the year-to-date period ended October 5, 2024 (the "year-to-date period") decreased 196.3 million, or 2.6 , to 7.29 billion from 7.48 billion in the year-to-date period ended October 7, 2023 (the "prior year-to-date-period"). Wholesale net sales decreased 25.9 million, or 1.6 to 1.58 billion in the third quarter from 1.60 billion in the prior year quarter. Wholesale net sales for the year-to-date period decreased 176.3 million, or 3.3 , to 5.14 billion from 5.32 billion in the prior year-to-date period. The decreases were due primarily to lower case volumes in both the national accounts and independent retailers customer channels. Overall case volumes for the segment were down in the current quarter and current year-to-date period by 3.2 and 5.6 , respectively. Retail net sales increased 12.4 million, or 1.9 , to 674.6 million in the third quarter from 662.2 million in the prior year quarter. Net sales for the year-to-date period decreased 20.0 million, or 0.9 , to 2.14 billion from 2.16 billion in the prior year-to-date period. Comparable store sales decreased 0.7 and 1.9 in the current quarter and current year-to-date periods, respectively. The comparable store sales declines were due primarily to lower consumer demand trends, which included a 4.0 and 4.5 decline in unit volumes in the current quarter and current year-to-date periods, respectively. The decreases in comparable store sales in both the current quarter and current year-to-date periods included offsetting increases in pharmacy sales. Retail's comparable store sales decreases were more than offset by incremental sales from newly acquired stores in the current quarter and partially offset by incremental sales from newly acquired stores in the current year. Additionally, lower fuel sales reduced Retail's reported net sales by 0.8 and 0.6 in the current quarter and current year-to-date periods, respectively. The Company defines a retail store as comparable when it is in operation for 14 accounting periods (a period equals four weeks), regardless of remodels, expansions, or relocated stores. Sales are compared to the same store s operations from the prior year period for purposes of calculation of comparable store sales. Fuel is excluded from the comparable sales calculation due to volatility in price. Comparable store sales is a widely used metric among retailers, which is useful to management and investors to assess performance. The Company s definition of comparable store sales may differ from similarly titled measures at other companies. 

 21 

Gross Profit Gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales, which includes purchase costs, in-bound freight, physical inventory adjustments, markdowns and promotional allowances and excludes warehousing costs, depreciation and other administrative expenses. The Company s gross profit definition may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Vendor allowances that relate to the buying and merchandising activities consist primarily of promotional allowances, which are generally allowances on purchased quantities and, to a lesser extent, slotting allowances, which are billed to vendors for the Company s merchandising costs, such as setting up warehouse infrastructure. These vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in cost of sales when the product is sold. Lump sum payments received for multi-year contracts are amortized over the life of the contracts based on contractual terms. The Wholesale segment includes shipping and handling costs in the Selling, general and administrative section of operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Gross profit increased 7.1 million to 354.6 million in the third quarter from 347.5 million in the prior year quarter. As a percent of net sales, gross profit for the current quarter was 15.8 compared to 15.3 in the prior year quarter. Gross profit for the year-to-date period increased 1.4 million from 1.147 billion in the prior year-to-date period to 1.148 billion in the current year. As a percent of net sales, gross profit for the year-to-date period was 15.8 compared to 15.3 in the prior year-to-date period. The gross profit variances in both the current quarter and current year were unfavorably impacted by lower volumes. The gross profit rate increases in the current quarter and current year were driven by lower last-in-first-out ("LIFO") expense of 5.1 million, or 22 basis points and 17.4 million, or 23 basis points, respectively, and favorable segment sales mix. Additionally, the increases in both the current quarter and current year were driven by benefits realized from the merchandising transformation initiative, partially offset by changes in customer mix within the Wholesale segment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses consist primarily of operating costs related to retail and supply chain operations, including salaries and wages, employee benefits, facility costs, shipping and handling, equipment rental, depreciation, and out-bound freight, in addition to corporate administrative expenses. SG A expenses for the third quarter increased 1.3 million to 324.1 million from 322.8 million in the prior year quarter, representing 14.4 of net sales in the third quarter compared to 14.3 in the prior year quarter. SG A expense for the year-to-date period decreased 13.9 million to 1.05 billion, from 1.06 billion in the prior year-to-date period, representing 14.4 in the current year-to-date period compared to 14.2 as a percentage of net sales in the prior year-to-date period. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a rate of sales in the current quarter was due primarily to increased Retail store labor and healthcare costs, partially offset by lower corporate administrative costs and benefits realized from the merchandising transformation. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a rate of sales in the year-to-date period was due primarily to increased Retail store labor and depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by lower incentive compensation and benefits realized from both the merchandising transformation and go-to-market strategy changes. Acquisition and Integration, net Third quarter and prior year quarter results included net charges of 0.3 million and 2.1 million, respectively. The year-to-date period and prior year-to-date period included charges of 3.2 million and 2.3 million, respectively. Current year activity consists of expenses associated with the Company's acquisition efforts within both segments while the prior year activity relates primarily to the Retail segment. Restructuring and Asset Impairment, net Third quarter and prior year quarter results included net charges of 5.4 million and a net gain of 0.5 million, respectively. The year-to-date period and prior year-to-date period included charges of 17.3 million and 1.4 million, respectively. The charges in the current quarter were primarily incurred within the Wholesale segment related to the closure of a distribution center, partially offset by gains within the Retail segment recognized from the early termination of lease agreements for two previously closed locations. The year-to-date charges also include impairment losses within the Retail segment related to an indefinite-lived trade name and long-lived assets due to changes in the competitive environment. The prior year quarter gain primarily relates to a 0.3 million gain for additional insurance proceeds related to a distribution location that sustained significant storm damage within the Wholesale segment, in addition to revised estimates for turnover and other lease ancillary costs associated with previously closed locations. The prior year charges primarily relate to two store closures within the Retail segment and impairment losses related to a distribution location that sustained significant storm damage within the Wholesale segment, partially offset by the sale of a store within the Retail segment.

Operating earnings for the year-to-date period decreased 1.5 million, or 1.8 , to 81.7 million from 83.2 million in the prior year-to-date period. The changes in operating earnings was due to the changes in net sales, gross profit and operating expenses discussed above.

Wholesale operating earnings increased 2.9 million, or 16.0 , to 21.1 million in the third quarter from 18.2 million in the prior year quarter. Operating earnings for the year-to-date period increased 13.1 million, or 19.8 , to 79.1 million from 66.0 million in the prior year-to-date period. The increase in operating earnings in the current quarter was due to an improvement in the gross profit rate, lower corporate administrative expenses, and benefits realized from the merchandising transformation initiative, partially offset by lower unit volumes and higher restructuring charges. The increase in operating earnings in the year-to-date period was due to an improvement in the gross profit rate, lower incentive compensation, and benefits realized from the merchandising transformation initiative, partially offset by lower unit volumes and higher restructuring charges. Retail operating earnings decreased 1.1 million, or 21.4 , to 3.9 million in the third quarter from 4.9 million in the prior year quarter. Operating earnings for the year-to-date period decreased 14.6 million, or 85.2 , to 2.5 million from 17.2 million in the prior year-to-date period. The decrease in operating earnings in the current quarter was due to increased healthcare costs and higher store labor, partially offset by higher sales volume, lower corporate administrative expenses and lower acquisition and integration charges. The decrease in operating earnings in the year-to-date period was due to lower unit volumes, increased restructuring and asset impairment charges, and higher store labor as a percent of net sales, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Interest Expense Interest expense increased 0.6 million, or 6.8 , to 9.9 million in the third quarter from 9.3 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense for the year-to-date period increased 3.7 million, or 12.3 , to 33.9 million from 30.2 million in the prior year-to-date period. Higher average debt balances on the Company's credit facility accounted for 0.8 million and 3.1 million of the increase in interest expense in the current quarter and current year, respectively. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 28.3 and 23.7 for the third quarter and prior year quarter, respectively. For the year-to-date period and prior year-to-date period, the effective tax rates were 28.6 and 24.4 , respectively. Differences from the federal statutory rate for all periods presented were due to state taxes and non-deductible expenses, partially offset by benefits associated with federal tax credits. The prior year also included discrete tax benefits from a change in contingencies, as well as stock compensation. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company also provides information regarding adjusted operating earnings, adjusted earnings from continuing operations, as well as per diluted share adjusted EPS ), net long-term debt, total capital, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted EBITDA ). These are non-GAAP financial measures, as defined below, and are used by management to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance. The Company believes these measures provide useful information for both management and its investors. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide additional understanding of the trends and special circumstances that affect its business. These measures provide useful supplemental information that helps investors to establish a basis for expected performance and the ability to evaluate actual results against that expectation. The measures, when considered in connection with GAAP results, can be used to assess the overall performance of the Company as well as assess the Company s performance against its peers. These measures are also used as a basis for certain compensation programs sponsored by the Company. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its financial results in these adjusted formats. Current year adjusted operating earnings, adjusted earnings from continuing operations, and adjusted EBITDA exclude, among other items, LIFO expense, organizational realignment, severance associated with cost reduction initiatives, operating and non-operating costs associated with the postretirement plan amendment and settlement and a non-operating benefit associated with a pension refund from an annuity provider. Current year organizational realignment includes consulting and severance costs associated with the Company's change in its go-to-market strategy as part of its long-term plan, which relates to the reorganization of certain functions. Costs related to the postretirement plan amendment and settlement include non-operating expenses associated with amortization of the prior service credit related to the amendment of the retiree medical plan, which are adjusted out of adjusted earnings from continuing operations. Postretirement plan amendment and settlement costs also include operating expenses related to payroll taxes which are adjusted out of all non-GAAP financial measures. The pension refund from an annuity provider is related to a terminated pension plan and is a non-operating benefit which is adjusted out of adjusted earnings from continuing operations. Prior year adjusted operating earnings, adjusted earnings from continuing operations, and adjusted EBITDA exclude, among other items, LIFO expense, organizational realignment, severance associated with cost reduction initiatives, and a non-routine settlement related to a legal matter resulting from a previously closed operation that was resolved during the prior year and operating and non-operating costs associated with the postretirement plan amendment and settlement. Each of these items are considered non-operational or non-core in nature. 

 23 

Adjusted Operating Earnings Adjusted operating earnings is a non-GAAP operating financial measure that the Company defines as operating earnings plus or minus adjustments for items that do not reflect the ongoing operating activities of the Company and costs associated with the closing of operational locations. The Company believes that adjusted operating earnings provide a meaningful representation of its operating performance for the Company as a whole and for its operating segments. The Company considers adjusted operating earnings as an additional way to measure operating performance on an ongoing basis. Adjusted operating earnings is meant to reflect the ongoing operating performance of all of its distribution and retail operations; consequently, it excludes the impact of items that could be considered non-operating or non-core in nature, and also excludes the contributions of activities classified as discontinued operations. Because adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings by segment are performance measures that management uses to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance, the Company believes it provides useful information for both management and its investors. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its operating financial results in an adjusted operating earnings format. Adjusted operating earnings is not a measure of performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings, and other income statement data. The Company s definition of adjusted operating earnings may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Following is a reconciliation of operating earnings to adjusted operating earnings for the 12- and 40- weeks ended October 5, 2024 and October 7, 2023.

Adjusted Earnings from Continuing Operations Adjusted earnings from continuing operations, as well as per diluted share ("adjusted EPS"), is a non-GAAP operating financial measure that the Company defines as net earnings plus or minus adjustments for items that do not reflect the ongoing operating activities of the Company and costs associated with the closing of operational locations. The Company believes that adjusted earnings from continuing operations provide a meaningful representation of its operating performance for the Company. The Company considers adjusted earnings from continuing operations as an additional way to measure operating performance on an ongoing basis. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations is meant to reflect the ongoing operating performance of all of its distribution and retail operations; consequently, it excludes the impact of items that could be considered non-operating or non-core in nature, and excludes the contributions of activities classified as discontinued operations. Because adjusted earnings from continuing operations is a performance measure that management uses to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance, the Company believes it provides useful information for both management and its investors. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its operating financial results in adjusted earnings from continuing operations format. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations is not a measure of performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data. The Company s definition of adjusted earnings from continuing operations may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Following is a reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted earnings from continuing operations for the 12- and 40- weeks ended October 5, 2024 and October 7, 2023.

Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP operating financial measure that the Company defines as net earnings plus interest, discontinued operations, depreciation and amortization, and other non-cash items including share-based payments (equity awards measured in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation , which include both stock-based compensation to employees and stock warrants issued to non-employees) and the LIFO provision, as well as adjustments for items that do not reflect the ongoing operating activities of the Company. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful representation of its operating performance for the Company and for its operating segments. The Company considers adjusted EBITDA as an additional way to measure operating performance on an ongoing basis. Adjusted EBITDA is meant to reflect the ongoing operating performance of all of its distribution and retail operations; consequently, it excludes the impact of items that could be considered non-operating or non-core in nature, and also excludes the contributions of activities classified as discontinued operations. Because adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by segment are performance measures that management uses to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance, the Company believes it provides useful information for both management and its investors. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its operating financial results in adjusted EBITDA format. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by segment are not measures of performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data. The Company s definitions of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by segment may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 27.6 million in the current year-to-date period compared to the prior year-to-date period, due primarily to ongoing working capital initiatives, as well as timing. Net cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased 28.6 million in the current year compared to the prior year due to an acquisition within the Retail segment in the current year, as well as higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were 97.9 million in the current year and cloud computing application development spend, which is included in operating activities, was 8.4 million, compared to capital expenditures of 86.2 million and cloud computing application development spend of 4.1 million in the prior year. The increase in capital expenditures in the current year compared to the prior year is in line with investments connected to the Company's long-term plan. The Wholesale and Retail segments utilized 50.8 and 49.2 of capital expenditures, respectively, in the current year. Net cash used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities decreased 12.2 million in the current year compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased net proceeds from the senior credit facility in the current year compared to the prior year. Debt Management Total debt, including finance lease liabilities, was 636.7 million and 597.5 million as of October 5, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. Liquidity The Company s principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and its senior secured credit facility, which includes Tranche A revolving loans, with a borrowing capacity of 1.17 billion, and Tranche A-1 revolving loans, with a borrowing capacity of 40 million. The Company has the ability to increase the amount borrowed under the Credit Agreement by an additional 195 million, subject to certain conditions. As of October 5, 2024, the senior secured credit facility had outstanding borrowings of 559.1 million. Additional available borrowings under the Company s credit facility are based on stipulated advance rates on eligible assets, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain excess availability of 10 of the borrowing base, as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company had excess availability after the 10 covenant of 384.7 million at October 5, 2024. Payment of dividends and repurchases of outstanding shares are permitted, provided that certain levels of excess availability are maintained. The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, of which 18.0 million were outstanding as of October 5, 2024. The credit facility matures November 17, 2027 and is secured by substantially all of the Company s assets. The Company believes that cash generated from operating activities and available borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, and debt service obligations for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that the business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that the Company will maintain its ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement. The Company anticipates that additional borrowings may be required to fund investments related to both organic and inorganic initiatives included in the long-term strategic plan. The Company s current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) was 1.62-to-1 at October 5, 2024 compared to 1.63-to-1 at December 30, 2023, and its investment in working capital was 438.1 million at October 5, 2024 compared to 417.6 million at December 30, 2023. The net long-term debt to total capital ratio was 0.44-to-1 at October 5, 2024 compared to 0.43-to-1 at December 30, 2023. 

 28 

Net long-term debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as long-term debt and finance lease liabilities, plus current portion of long-term debt and finance lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. The ratio of net long-term debt to adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA, on a rolling 52-week basis, by net long-term debt, as defined previously. The ratio of net long-term debt to total capital is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated by dividing net long-term debt, as defined previously, by total capital (net long-term debt plus total shareholders equity). The Company believes both management and its investors find the information useful because it reflects the amount of long-term debt obligations that are not covered by available cash and temporary investments. Total net long-term debt and adjusted EBITDA are not substitutes for GAAP financial measures and may differ from similarly titled measures of other companies. Following is a reconciliation of Long-term debt and finance lease liabilities to Net long-term debt as of October 5, 2024 and December 30, 2023 and "Net earnings" to Adjusted EBITDA on the rolling 52- week basis ended October 5, 2024 and December 30, 2023.

For information on material cash requirements, see the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. At October 5, 2024, there have been no significant changes to the Company s material cash requirements outside the ordinary course of business. 

 29 

Cash Dividends During the quarter ended October 5, 2024, the Company declared 7.6 million in dividends. A 1.2 increase in the quarterly dividend rate from 0.215 per share to 0.2175 per share was approved by the Board of Directors and announced on March 7, 2024. Although the Company expects to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend, adoption of a dividend policy does not commit the Board of Directors to declare future dividends. Each future dividend will be considered and declared by the Board of Directors at its discretion. Whether the Board of Directors continues to declare dividends depends on a number of factors, including the Company s future financial condition, anticipated profitability and cash flows and compliance with the terms of its credit facilities. Under the senior revolving credit facility, the Company is generally permitted to pay dividends in any fiscal year up to an amount such that all cash dividends, together with any cash distributions and share repurchases, do not exceed 35.0 million. Additionally, the Company is generally permitted to pay cash dividends and repurchase shares in excess of 35.0 million in any fiscal year so long as its Excess Availability, as defined in the senior revolving credit facility, is in excess of 15 of the Total Borrowing Base, as defined in the senior revolving credit facility, before and after giving effect to the repurchases and dividends. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has also made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond October 5, 2024. These commitments consist primarily of purchase commitments, standby letters of credit of 18.0 million as of October 5, 2024, and interest on long-term debt and finance lease liabilities. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Based on the Company s ongoing review, the Company makes adjustments it considers appropriate under the facts and circumstances. This discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company believes these accounting policies and others set forth in Item 7 to the consolidated financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the Company s financial condition and results of operations. The Company has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The accompanying financial statements are prepared using the same critical accounting policies discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Refer to Note 2 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk There have been no material changes in market risk of SpartanNash from the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedure s An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of SpartanNash Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as currently defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) was performed as of October 5, 2024 (the Evaluation Date ). This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of SpartanNash Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer CEO ), Chief Financial Officer CFO and Corporate Controller. As of the Evaluation Date, SpartanNash Company s management, including the CEO, CFO and Corporate Controller, concluded that SpartanNash s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the Evaluation Date to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including its principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the third quarter of 2024 there were no changes that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, SpartanNash s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings The information required by this Part II, Item 1 is incorporated by reference to the information set forth under the caption Commitments and Contingencies in Note 8 in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. ITEM 1A.
