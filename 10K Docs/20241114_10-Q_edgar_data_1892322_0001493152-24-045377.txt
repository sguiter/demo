 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

shares of its common shares to the shareholders of HeartCore Japan in exchange for shares out of shares of common
shares issued by HeartCore Japan, representing approximately of HeartCore Japan s outstanding common shares. On February
24, 2022, the Company purchased the remaining shares of common shares of HeartCore Japan. As a result, HeartCore Japan became a wholly-owned
operating subsidiary of the Company. 

The
share exchange on July 16, 2021 has been accounted for as a recapitalization between entities under common control since the same controlling
shareholders controlled these two entities before and after the transaction. The consolidation of the Company and its subsidiary has
been accounted for at historical cost and prepared on the basis as if the transaction had become effective as of the beginning of the
earliest period presented in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. 

The
Company, via its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, HeartCore Japan, is mainly engaged in the business of developing and sales of comprehensive
software. Beginning from early 2022, HeartCore USA is engaged in the business of providing consulting services to Japanese companies
with intention to go public in the United States capital market. 

On
September 6, 2022, HeartCore USA entered into a share exchange and purchase agreement Sigmaways Agreement to acquire
 of the outstanding shares of Sigmaways, Inc. Sigmaways ), a company incorporated under the laws of the State of California
in April 2006, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Sigmaways B.V. and Sigmaways Technologies Ltd. Sigmaways Technologies ).
Sigmaways B.V. was incorporated in Netherlands in November 2019. Sigmaways Technologies was incorporated in Canada in August 2020. Sigmaways
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the business of developing and sales of software in the United States. The
acquisition was closed on February 1, 2023. 

In
January 2023, HeartCore USA incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, HeartCore Financial, Inc. HeartCore Financial ), under
the laws of the State of Delaware. HeartCore Financial is engaged in the business of providing financial consulting services. 

In
February 2023, HeartCore USA incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, HeartCore Capital Advisors, Inc. HeartCore Capital Advisors ),
in Japan. HeartCore Capital Advisors is engaged in the business of providing financial consulting services to Japanese companies. 

In
November 2023, HeartCore Japan established a owned subsidiary in Vietnam, HeartCore Luvina Vietnam Company Limited HeartCore
Luvina ), which is engaged in the business of providing software development and other services. HeartCore Luvina started its operations
from February 2024. 

On
November 17, 2023, HeartCore Japan and HeartCore Capital Advisors entered into a merger agreement to merge the two entities into one
with HeartCore Japan being the surviving entity. On January 1, 2024, the merger was completed and HeartCore Capital Advisors transferred
all of its assets and liabilities to HeartCore Japan. The merger has been accounted for as a recapitalization between entities under
common control since the same controlling shareholders controlled the two entities before and after the transaction. 

In
April 2024, HeartCore Financial incorporated a branch office, HeartCore Financial, Inc. Japan Branch Office HeartCore
Financial Japan ), in Japan. HeartCore Financial Japan is engaged in the business of providing financial consulting
services.

. 

The
Company currently generates its revenue from the following main sources: 

Revenues
from On-premise Software 

Licenses
for on-premise software provide the customers with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customers. The
Company provides on-premise software in the form of both perpetual licenses and term-based licenses which grant the customers with the
right for a specified term. Revenues from on-premise licenses are recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available
to the customers. Licenses for on-premise software are typically sold to the customers with maintenance and support services in a bundle.
Revenues under the bundled arrangements are allocated based on the relative standalone selling prices SSP of on-premise
software and maintenance and support service. The SSP for maintenance and support services is estimated based upon observable transactions
when those services are sold on a standalone basis. The SSP of on-premise software is typically estimated using the residual approach
as the Company is unable to establish the SSP for on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for
a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions
or other observable evidence. 

Revenues
from Maintenance and Support Services 

Maintenance
and support services provided with software licenses consist of trouble shooting, technical support and the right to receive unspecified
software updates when and if available during the subscription. Revenues from maintenance and support services are recognized over time
as such services are performed. Revenues for consumption-based services are generally recognized as the services are performed and accepted
by the customers. 

Revenues
from Software as a Service SaaS 

The
Company s software is available for use as hosted application arrangements under subscription fee agreements without licensing
the rights of the software to the customers. Subscription fees from these applications are recognized over time on a ratable basis over
the customer agreement term beginning on the date the Company s solution is made available to the customers. The subscription contracts
are generally one year or less in length. 

Revenues
from Software Development and Other Miscellaneous Services 

The
Company provides customers with software development and support services pursuant to their specific requirements, which primarily compose
of consulting, integration, training, custom application, and workflow development. The Company also provides other miscellaneous services,
such as 3D Space photography. The Company generally recognizes revenues at a point in time when control is transferred to the customers
and the Company is entitled to the payment, which is when the promised services are delivered and accepted by the customers. 

Revenues
from Customized Software Development and Services 

The
Company s customized software development and services revenues primarily include revenues from providing software development
solutions and other support services to its customers. The contract pricing is at stated billing rates per hour. These contracts are
generally short-term in nature and not longer than one year in duration. For services provided under the contracts that result in the
transfer of control over time, the underlying deliverable in the contracts is owned and controlled by the customers and does not create
an asset with an alternative use to the Company. The Company recognizes revenues on rate per hour contracts based on the amount billable
to the customers, as the Company has the right to invoice the customers in an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the
customers of the Company s performance to date. 

Revenues
from Consulting Services 

The
Company provides public listing related consulting services to customers pursuant to the specific requirements prescribed in the contracts,
which primarily include communicating with intermediary parties, preparing required documents related to the initial public offering
and supporting the listing process. The consulting service contracts normally include both cash and noncash considerations. Cash consideration
is paid in installment payments and is recognized in revenues over the period of the contract by reference to progress toward complete
satisfaction of that performance obligation. Noncash consideration is in the form of warrants of the customers and is measured at fair
value at contract inception. Noncash consideration that is variable for reasons other than only the form of the consideration is included
in the transaction price, but is subject to the constraint on variable consideration. The Company assesses the estimated amount of the
variable noncash consideration at contract inception and subsequently, to determine when and to what extent it is probable that a significant
reversal in the amount of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur once the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration
is subsequently resolved. Only when the significant revenues reversal is concluded probable of not occurring can variable consideration
be included in revenues. Based on evaluation of likelihood and magnitude of a reversal in applying the constraint, the variable noncash
consideration is recognized in revenues until the underlying uncertainties have been resolved. 

The
Company records reduction to revenues for estimated customer returns and allowances. The Company bases its estimates on historical rates
of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns. The actual amount of customer returns
and allowances, which is inherently uncertain, may differ from the Company s estimates. If the Company determines that actual or
expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves it established, it would record a reduction or increase,
as appropriate, to revenues in the period in which it makes such a determination. Reserves for customer refunds are included within other
current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At a minimum, the Company reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly
basis. 

The
timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to the customers. The Company has determined that its contracts
do not include a significant financing component. The Company records a contract asset, which is included in accounts receivable, current
or non-current, in the consolidated balance sheets, when revenues are recognized prior to invoicing. The Company factors certain accounts
receivable upon or after the performance obligation is being met. The Company records deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets
when revenues are recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Deferred revenue is reported net of related uncollected deferred
revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of revenues recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
that were included in the opening deferred revenue balance was approximately million and million, respectively. 

Disaggregation
of Revenues 

The
Company disaggregates its revenues from contracts by product/service types, as the Company believes it best depicts how the nature, amount,
timing and uncertainty of the revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The Company s disaggregation of revenues
by revenue stream for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as following:

(the Nasdaq Staff indicating that the Company was not in compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth
in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
The notification of noncompliance had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company s common stock on the Nasdaq
Capital Market under the symbol HTCR, and the Company continued to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and
evaluate its alternatives, if appropriate, to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with this rule.

any time during this period the closing bid price of the Company s common stock is at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10
consecutive business days, the Nasdaq Staff would provide the Company with written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be
closed.

listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all of the other applicable standards for initial listing on the Nasdaq
Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and provided written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency
during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary, then the Company may be granted an additional 180
calendar days to regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2). 

On April 24, 2024, the Company received written notice (the April 2024 Nasdaq Letter from the
Nasdaq Staff indicating that although the Company was not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, the Nasdaq Staff determined
that the Company was eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period, or until October 21, 2024, to regain compliance. The Nasdaq
Staff indicated that its determination was based on the Company meeting the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly
held shares and all of the other applicable requirements for initial listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the
Minimum Bid Requirement, and the Company s written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance
period by effectuating a reverse stock split, if necessary. Accordingly, there was no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the
Company s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol HTCR. 

If
at any time between April 24, 2024 and October 21, 2024, the closing bid price of the Company s common stock was at least 1.00
per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, the Nasdaq Staff would provide the Company with written confirmation of compliance
and the matter would be closed. 

On
October 22, 2024, the Company received written notice (the October 2024 Nasdaq Notice from the Nasdaq Staff indicating
that the Company was not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Pursuant to the October 2024 Nasdaq Notice, unless the
Company requests an appeal of the determination to delist the Company s common stock by October 29, 2024, trading of the Company s
common stock will be suspended at the opening of business on October 31, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC which will
remove the Company s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq. 

The
Company appealed the determination on October 29, 2024. Submission of the hearing request stayed the suspension of the Company s
securities and the filing of the Form 25-NSE pending the Panel s decision. 

On November 5, 2024, the Company received written
notice from the Nasdaq Staff that the Company demonstrated compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result, the hearing appealed on October 29, 2024 has

revenues and expenses, to disclose contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements,
and to disclose the reported amounts of revenues and expenses incurred during the financial reporting period. We continue to evaluate
the estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We rely on these evaluations as the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use
of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our
accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We believe critical accounting policies as disclosed
herein reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenues under the Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . 

To
determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s)
with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable
consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price
to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance
obligation. Revenues amount represents the invoiced value, net of a value-added tax Consumption Tax and applicable local
government levies. The Consumption Tax on sales are calculated at 10 of gross sales in Japan and Vietnam, 5 of gross sales in Canada,
21 of gross sales in Netherlands and nil of gross sales in the United States. 

The
Company currently generates its revenue from the following main sources: 

Revenues
from On-Premise Software 

Licenses
for on-premise software provide the customers with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customers. The
Company provides on-premise software in the form of both perpetual licenses and term-based licenses which grant the customers with the
right for a specified term. Revenues from on-premise licenses are recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available
to the customers. Licenses for on-premise software are typically sold to the customers with maintenance and support services in a bundle.
Revenues under the bundled arrangements are allocated based on the relative standalone selling prices SSP of on-premise
software and maintenance and support service. The SSP for maintenance and support services is estimated based upon observable transactions
when those services are sold on a standalone basis. The SSP of on-premise software is typically estimated using the residual approach
as the Company is unable to establish the SSP for on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for
a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions
or other observable evidence. 

Revenues
from Maintenance and Support Services 

Maintenance
and support services provided with software licenses consist of trouble shooting, technical support and the right to receive unspecified
software updates when and if available during the subscription. Revenues from maintenance and support services are recognized over time
as such services are performed. Revenues for consumption-based services are generally recognized as the services are performed and accepted
by the customers. 

Revenues
from Software as a Service SaaS 

The
Company s software is available for use as hosted application arrangements under subscription fee agreements without licensing
the rights of the software to the customers. Subscription fees from these applications are recognized over time on a ratable basis over
the customer agreement term beginning on the date the Company s solution is made available to the customers. The subscription contracts
are generally one year or less in length. 

Revenues
from Software Development and Other Miscellaneous Services 

The
Company provides customers with software development and support services pursuant to their specific requirements, which are primarily
composed of consulting, integration, training, custom application, and workflow development. The Company also provides other miscellaneous
services, such as 3D space photography. The Company generally recognizes revenues at a point in time when control is transferred to the
customers and the Company is entitled to the payment, which is when the promised services are delivered and accepted by the customers. 

13 

Revenues
from Customized Software Development and Services 

The
Company s customized software development and services revenues primarily include revenues from providing software development
solutions and other support services to its customers. The contract pricing is at stated billing rates per hour. These contracts are
generally short-term in nature and not longer than one year in duration. For services provided under the contracts that result in the
transfer of control over time, the underlying deliverable in the contracts is owned and controlled by the customers and does not create
an asset with an alternative use to the Company. The Company recognizes revenues on rate per hour contracts based on the amount billable
to the customers, as the Company has the right to invoice the customers in an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the
customers of the Company s performance to date. 

Revenues
from Consulting Services 

The
Company provides public listing related consulting services to customers pursuant to the specific requirements prescribed in the contracts,
which primarily include communicating with intermediary parties, preparing required documents related to the initial public offering
and supporting the listing process. The consulting service contracts normally include both cash and noncash considerations. Cash consideration
is paid in installment payments and is recognized in revenues over the period of the contract by reference to progress toward complete
satisfaction of that performance obligation. Noncash consideration is in the form of warrants of the customers and is measured at fair
value at contract inception. Noncash consideration that is variable for reasons other than only the form of the consideration is included
in the transaction price, but is subject to the constraint on variable consideration. The Company assesses the estimated amount of the
variable noncash consideration at contract inception and subsequently, to determine when and to what extent it is probable that a significant
reversal in the amount of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur once the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration
is subsequently resolved. Only when the significant revenues reversal is concluded probable of not occurring can variable consideration
be included in revenues. Based on evaluation of likelihood and magnitude of a reversal in applying the constraint, the variable noncash
consideration is recognized in revenues until the underlying uncertainties have been resolved. 

The
Company records reduction to revenues for estimated customer returns and allowances. The Company bases its estimates on historical rates
of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns. The actual amount of customer returns
and allowances, which is inherently uncertain, may differ from the Company s estimates. If the Company determines that actual or
expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves it established, it would record a reduction or increase,
as appropriate, to revenues in the period in which it makes such a determination. Reserves for customer refunds are included within other
current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At a minimum, the Company reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly
basis. 

The
timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to the customers. The Company has determined that its contracts
do not include a significant financing component. The Company records a contract asset, which is included in accounts receivable, current
and non-current, in the consolidated balance sheets, when revenues are recognized prior to invoicing. The Company factors certain accounts
receivable upon or after the performance obligation is being met. The Company records deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets
when revenues are recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Deferred revenue is reported net of related uncollected deferred
revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of revenues recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
that were included in the opening deferred revenue balance was approximately 1.8 million and 1.5 million, respectively.
