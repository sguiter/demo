and , respectively. No options
were outstanding for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The number of shares included in the determination of earnings
on a diluted basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were none, as doing so would have been anti-dilutive. 

was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, for which cash was received during 2022. 

million and had less than million of cash as of September 30, 2024. The Company s cash resources
from operations may be insufficient to meet its anticipated needs during the next twelve months. If the Company does not execute its
plan, it may require additional financing to fund its future planned operations. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company having adequate capital to fund its operating plan
and performance. Management s plans to continue as a going concern may include raising additional capital through sales of equity
securities and borrowing, continuing to focus our Company on the most profitable elements, and exploring alternative funding sources
on an as needed basis. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of
its plans. The COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain challenges, and inflationary pressures have impacted the Company s business operations
to some extent and is expected to continue to do so and, these impacts may include reduced access to capital. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern may be dependent upon its ability to successfully secure other sources of financing and attain profitable
operations. There is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s primary sources of liquidity have traditionally been comprised of cash and cash equivalents as well as availability under
the Credit Agreement in place at the time (see Note 3). This credit facility, as amended, matures on September 30, 2025. While we expect
to have sufficient financial resources available on acceptable terms, there can be no assurance this will occur, particularly in light
of increasingly conservative financial markets. 

million (the Maximum Revolver Amount and term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of Term Loan Amount 
and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Facilities ). The Senior Facilities are secured by substantially
all assets of the Company. The Company believes it has been in compliance with the terms of these Senior Facilities since their inception
in September 2021. 

Interest
on the Senior Facilities is set at the prime rate published from time to time published in the Wall Street Journal as of September
30, 2024), plus per annum, accruing daily and payable monthly. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for
the actual number of days elapsed. The Term Loan Facility shall be repaid by the Company to Lender in equal monthly installments of
principal and interest, each in the amount of , commencing on November 1, 2021, and continuing on the first day of each month
thereafter until the Term Loan Maturity Date (as defined in the Agreement). Also, the Company paid the Lender collateral monitoring fees
of of the eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment supporting the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan. 

The
Senior Facilities matured on September 30, 2023 and were amended to extend the maturity date to September 30, 2025. The facility automatically
extends for successive periods of one year each, unless the Company or the Lender gives the other party written notice of termination
not less than 90 days prior to the end of such term or renewal term, as applicable. If the Senior Facilities are renewed, the Company
shall pay the Lender a renewal fee of of the Maximum Revolver Amount and the Term Loan Amount upon each renewal on the anniversary
of the Closing Date. The Company has the option to prepay the Term Loan Facility (together with all accrued but unpaid interest and a
Term Loan Prepayment Fee (as defined the Agreement) in whole, but not in part, upon not less than 60 days prior written notice to the
Lender. With the September 30, 2023 amendment, the parties agreed changes in terms including: 

- 
 Replace
 the asset monitoring fee on the Revolving Credit Facility with an increase in interest rate, to Prime plus per annum. This
 change was intended by the parties to be financially neutral while easier to administer. 

- 
 Reduce
 the interest rate on the Term Loan to Prime plus per annum, with lender making a one-time additional advance of to
 reset the Term Loan to . 

- 
 Reduce
 the renewal fee for this transaction to from the formula described above. 

- 
 Set
 the Term Loan asset monitoring fee to per month. 

The
Senior Facilities require that the Company maintain Tangible Net Worth of at least or greater Minimum Tangible Net
Worth ). Minimum Tangible Net Worth may be adjusted downward by the Lender, from time to time, in its sole and absolute discretion,
based on the effect of non-cash charges and other factors on the calculation of Tangible Net Worth. Other debt subordinated to Lender
is not considered as a reduction of this calculation. The Company believes it was in compliance with this covenant for all relevant months,
including as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The
Senior Facilities contain certain affirmative and negative covenants that limit the ability of the Company, among other things and subject
to certain significant exceptions, to incur debt or liens, make investments, enter into certain mergers, consolidations, and acquisitions,
pay dividends and make other restricted payments, or make capital expenditures exceeding in the aggregate in any fiscal year. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the term loan balance amounted to and million, respectively, which consisted of
the principal and interest payable balance of and million, respectively and deferred financing costs of approximately 
and , respectively. The balance of the Revolving Line of Credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 amounted to 
and , respectively. 

Notes
Payable, Related Party 

The
Company is party to a note payable to John H. Schwan, Director and former Chairman of the Board, with a loan balance due of million
as of December 31, 2023 and an interest rate of . The Company repaid million to Mr. Schwan during January 2024. The parties agreed
to the payment of the remaining million at a future date to be determined. This related party note payable is subordinate to the
Senior Facilities. 

shares of Series E Convertible Preferred
Stock Series E Preferred resulting in gross proceeds of million from an unrelated third party. In aggregate, between
Series E Preferred and Series F Convertible Preferred Stock Series F Preferred financings, million of the total
Series E and F proceeds were received as an advance prior to December 31, 2023. These funds advanced were initially classified as a current
liability until the agreement was finalized and shares were issued, at which time it was reclassified as equity, similar to the prior
Convertible Preferred issuances. The issuance of the Series E Preferred Stock resulted in an allocation of million to the convertible
preferred stock and million to the warrants described below and classified as Additional Paid-In Capital. Holders of the Series
E Preferred will be entitled to receive quarterly dividends at the annual rate of of the stated value per share) and have a
liquidation preference over common stock. Such dividends may be paid in cash or otherwise based on the terms of the agreement. In addition,
 warrants to purchase the Company s common stock were issued with respect to this transaction. These warrants are exercisable
until March 2027, at the lower of per share or of the variable price based on the ten day volume weighted average price VWAP of the Company s common stock. Accrued dividends of and were recorded for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024. 

Series
F Convertible Preferred Stock 

In
March 2024, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to authorize the issuance of shares of Series F Preferred resulting
in gross proceeds of million from an unrelated third party. As disclosed above certain of these proceeds were received as an advance
prior to December 31, 2023. This investment was initially classified as a current liability until the agreement was finalized and shares
were issued, at which time it was classified as equity, similar to the prior Convertible Preferred issuances. The issuance of the Series
F Preferred Stock resulted in an allocation of million to the convertible preferred stock and million to the warrants described
below and classified as Additional Paid-In Capital. Holders of the Series F Preferred will be entitled to receive quarterly dividends
at the annual rate of of the stated value per share) and have a liquidation preference over common stock. Such dividends may
be paid in cash or stock, at the Company s discretion, based on the terms of the agreement. In addition, warrants to purchase 
shares of the Company s common stock were issued with respect to this transaction. These warrants are exercisable until March 2027,
at the lower of per share or of the variable price based on the ten day volume weighted average price VWAP of the Company s common stock prior to exercise. Accrued dividends of and were recorded for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

Deposits
and Note Conversion to Common Stock 

In
connection with the 2021 sale and leaseback transaction of the Company s primary facility in Lake Barrington, IL, the landlord
advanced rent payments in the form of a note. The balance of that note on December 31, 2022 was approximately . The note paid
 interest and was due March 2024. In addition, the same entity made investment deposits during 2022 that were recorded as short term
deposit liabilities. On February 1, 2023, our Board of Directors approved the conversion of these liabilities into common stock at a
rate of approximately of the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company s common stock during the period these deposits
were received. In total, approximately million of liabilities were converted into approximately million shares of our common
stock during 2023. Upon conversion, both the note and deposit liabilities were fully eliminated. 

Warrants 

In
connection with the Series D Offering in 2021, the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock
for per share. During November 2023, the Company issued shares of its common stock to retire all outstanding warrants, as
well as a deferred liability related to facility rent credits received from the Lake Barrington landlord. The warrants were
converted in a cashless transaction based on the terms of the warrants. The Board of Directors determined the conversion price of the
deferred liability would be consistent with the approach listed above, of the volume weighted average price during the relevant time
period. Both of these items are fully resolved upon this transaction. 

As
described above, in connection with the Series E and F convertible preferred equity issuances, a total of warrants were issued,
exercisable for the Company s common stock at the lower of per share or of the 10 day VWAP. 

The
Company has applied the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value these warrants for the purchase of common stock. That model incorporates
various assumptions including the risk-free rate of interest to be applied, the estimated dividend yield and expected volatility of the
Company s Common Stock. The risk-free rate of interest is the U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods within the expected term of
the instrument. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company s Common Stock. 

The
valuation assumptions we have applied to determine the fair value of warrants issued in 2024 were as follows: 

- 
 Historical
 stock price volatility: The Company used the weekly closing price to calculate historical annual volatility which was a range from
 - . 

- 
 Risk-free
 interest rate: The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the rate payable on US treasury securities with a similar maturity
 in effect at the time of the grant, which was . 

- 
 Expected
 life: The expected life of the warrants represents the period of time warrants were expected to be outstanding. The Company used
 an expected life of years which is consistent with the contractual term. 

- 
 Dividend
 yield: The estimate for dividend yield is , as the Company did not issue dividends during 2020 through 2024 and does not expect
 to do so in the foreseeable future. 

- 
 Estimated
 forfeitures: When estimating forfeitures, the Company considers historical terminations as well as anticipated retirements.

contain these words. Although we believe that our opinions and expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable,
we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements, and our actual results may differ substantially
from the views and expectations set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We disclaim any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking
statements after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our opinions
or expectations. These forward-looking statements are affected by factors, risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we make, including,

Overview 

We
produce film products for novelty, packaging and container applications. These products include foil balloons, latex balloons and related
products, films for packaging and custom product applications, and flexible containers for packaging and consumer storage applications.
We produce all of our film products for packaging, container applications and most of our foil balloons at our plant in Lake Barrington,
Illinois. We used to produce our latex balloons and latex products at a majority-owned facility in Guadalajara, Mexico (Flexo Universal,
or Flexo). This facility was sold during October 2021. Now the Company purchases latex balloons from an unrelated vendor and distributes
in the United States, particularly to those customers that prefer a combined solution for foil and latex balloons.. Substantially all
of our film products for packaging and custom product applications are sold to customers in the United States. We market and sell our
novelty items, Balloon inspired gifts (balloons and candy arranged to look like a flower bouquet for gifting) and flexible containers
for consumer use primarily in the United States. During 2023 we changed our name to include Green , to communicate our intention
to supply biodegradable and compostable materials to the marketplace that our developed by our partners in Asia. We created a new subsidiary,
in part, for this purpose. 

September
30, 2021 financing, amended and extended to September 30, 2025 

On
September 30, 2021 (the Closing Date ), the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the Agreement with Line Financial (the Lender ), which provides for a senior secured financing consisting of a revolving credit facility
(the Revolving Credit Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of up to 6 million (the Maximum Revolver Amount and term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of 731,250 Term Loan Amount 
and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Facilities ). The Senior Facilities are secured by substantially
all assets of the Company. This Agreement and the Senior Facilities were extended on similar terms during September 2023 with a termination
date of September 30, 2025. The Company has been in compliance with the terms of these Senior Facilities since inception in September
2021. 

Interest
on the Senior Facilities was set at the prime rate published from time to time published in the Wall Street Journal (8.0 as of September
30, 2024), plus 1.95 per annum, accruing daily and payable monthly. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for
the actual number of days elapsed. The Term Loan Facility shall be repaid by the Company to Lender in 48 equal monthly installments of
principal and interest, each in the amount of 15,000, commencing on November 1, 2021, and continuing on the first day of each month
thereafter until the Term Loan Maturity Date (as defined in the Agreement). Also, the Company paid the Lender collateral monitoring fees
of 4.62 of the eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment supporting the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan.

 Table of Contents 

The
Senior Facilities matured on September 30, 2023 and were amended to extend the maturity date to September 30, 2025. The facility automatically
extends for successive periods of one year each, unless the Company or the Lender gives the other party written notice of termination
not less than 90 days prior to the end of such term or renewal term, as applicable. If the Senior Facilities are renewed, the Company
shall pay the Lender a renewal fee of 1.25 of the Maximum Revolver Amount and the Term Loan Amount upon each renewal on the anniversary
of the Closing Date. The Company has the option to prepay the Term Loan Facility (together with all accrued but unpaid interest and a
Term Loan Prepayment Fee (as defined the Agreement) in whole, but not in part, upon not less than 60 days prior written notice to the
Lender. With the September 30, 2023 amendment, the parties agreed changes in terms including: 

- 
 Replace the asset monitoring
 fee on the Revolving Credit Facility with an increase in interest rate, to Prime plus 7.82 per annum. This change was intended by
 the parties to be financially neutral while easier to administer. 

- 
 Reduce the interest rate
 on the Term Loan to Prime plus 1.45 per annum, with lender making a one-time additional advance of 206,000 to reset the Term Loan
 to 731,000. 

- 
 Reduce the renewal fee
 for this transaction to 50,000 from the formula described above. 

- 
 Set the Term Loan asset
 monitoring fee to 0.385 per month. 

The
Senior Facilities require that the Company maintain Tangible Net Worth of at least 4,000,000 or greater Minimum Tangible Net
Worth ). Minimum Tangible Net Worth may be adjusted downward by the Lender, from time to time, in its sole and absolute discretion,
based on the effect of non-cash charges and other factors on the calculation of Tangible Net Worth. Other debt subordinated to Lender
is not considered as a reduction of this calculation. The Company believes it was in compliance with this covenant for all relevant months,
including as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The
Senior Facilities contain certain affirmative and negative covenants that limit the ability of the Company, among other things and subject
to certain significant exceptions, to incur debt or liens, make investments, enter into certain mergers, consolidations, and acquisitions,
pay dividends and make other restricted payments, or make capital expenditures exceeding 1,000,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the term loan balance amounted to 0.6 million and 0.7 million, respectively, which consisted
of the principal and interest payable balance of 0.6 million and 0.7 million, respectively, and deferred financing costs of approximately
 24,000 and 40,000, respectively. The balance of the Revolving Line of Credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 amounted
to 4,062,000 and 4,991,000, respectively. 

Note
Payable, Related Party 

The
Company is party to a note payable to John H. Schwan, Director and former Chairman of the Board, with a loan balance of 1.3 million
and interest rate of 6 as of December 31, 2023. The Company repaid 1 million to Mr. Schwan during January 2024. The parties agreed
to the payment of the remaining 0.3 million at a future date to be determined. This related party note payable is subordinate to the
Senior Facilities.

Foil
Balloons . Revenues from the sale of foil balloons increased during the three months period from 1,701,000 ending September 30, 2023
compared to 2,322,000 during the three month period of 2024. Revenues from the sale of foil balloons increased during the nine month
period from 8,113,000 ending September 30, 2023 compared to 8,493,000 during the nine month period of 2024. Order flow from our largest
customer was the cause of this increase. 

Films .
Revenues from the sale of commercial films were 129,000 and 605,000 during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024,
compared to 68,000 and 746,000 during the same periods of 2023. Order flow in this area has been historically inconsistent, impacted
in part by consolidation in the industry, including our customers, as well as a large number of competitors. 

Other
Revenues . Revenues from the sale of other products were 89,000 and 2,690,000 during the three and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2024, compared to 154,000 and 2,174,000 during the same periods of 2023. The revenues from the sale of other
products during these periods include (i) sales of a line of balloon-inspired gift items and similar products consisting of candy
and small inflated balloons sold in small containers, (ii) latex balloons, and (iii) the sale of accessories and supply items
related to balloon products. The increase in Other Revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by increased orders for
balloon-inspired gifts from the Company s second largest customer. 

Sales
to a limited number of customers continue to represent a large percentage of our net sales. The table below illustrates the impact on
sales of our top three and ten customers for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

As
of September 30, 2024, the total amounts owed to the Company by these customers were approximately 2,077,000 or 95 of the Company s
consolidated net accounts receivable. The amounts owed at September 30, 2023 by these customers were approximately 806,000 or 81 of
the Company s consolidated net accounts receivable. 

Cost
of Sales . During the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2024, the cost of sales was 2,560,000 and 10,220,000, compared
to 1,903,000 and 9,372,000 respectively for the same periods of 2023, with the change driven largely by changes in sales volume. As
a percentage of sales, cost of sales was 101 and 87 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 99 and
85 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. During July 2024 we experienced a fire sprinkler failure in our warehouse
which forced us to dispose of 0.2 million of product. Net of insurance proceeds, our inventory loss was approximately 40,000. Also,
fourth quarter 2024 shipments are scheduled later in the quarter than in 2023, which reduced the amount of manufacturing cost capitalized
into the annual seasonal inventory build. 

General
and Administrative . During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 751,000
and 2,449,000 compared to 677,000 and 2,294,000, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The Company had higher than usual audit
fees in both years. Of note are the one-time costs associated with reperforming audit procedures related to 2023 due to the Company s
former auditor being suspended from practicing before the SEC during May 2024. This resulted in 170,000 higher audit expenses during
the three months ended September 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. 

Selling,
Advertising and Marketing . During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, selling, advertising and marketing expenses
were 220,000 and 633,000 as compared to 172,000 and 474,000, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. 2023 marked a low point
in these expenses while 2024 inflected higher, including 45,000 in additional sales commissions based on product mix and the payroll
cost associated with new product design. 

Other
Income (Expense) . During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred interest expense of 201,000
and 655,000 compared to interest expense of 124,000 and 421,000, respectively, during the same periods of 2023. Interest expense increased
as a result of market rate increases that remained elevated throughout 2024. The September 2023 refinance caused a shift from bank fees
to interest, with the net result of this process change being approximately even. The Company applied for Employee Retention Tax Credits
during 2021, most of which were factored during 2022 and cash received. Income related to the factored credit filings was recognized
when the returns were processed by the US Government during 2023. As such, income of 895,000 was recognized during the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, respectively, for which cash was received during 2022.

Significant
changes in working capital items during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included:

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company executing its business plan and, if unable to do so,
in obtaining adequate capital on acceptable terms to fund any operating losses. Management s plans to continue as a going concern
include executing its business plan, continuing to focus our Company on the most profitable elements, and exploring alternative funding
sources on an as needed basis. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing
any of its plans. The COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures, and the cost and commercial availability of
helium have impacted the Company s business operations to some extent and is expected to continue to do so and, these impacts may
include reduced access to capital. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully
generate or otherwise secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. There is substantial doubt about the ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern. 

The
Company s primary sources of liquidity have traditionally been comprised of cash and cash equivalents as well as availability under
the Credit Agreement. We believe that we have been in compliance with covenants since refinancing with Line Financial in September 2021.
That Credit Agreement expires per its terms on September 30, 2025, unless it is extended by the parties or replaced. While the Company
expects to have access to needed capital at reasonable cost, there can be no assurance of success, and as such, might negatively impact
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Seasonality 

In
the foil balloon product line, sales have historically been seasonal with approximately 40 occurring in the period from December through
March of the succeeding year and 24 being generated in the period July through October in recent years. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
critical accounting estimates utilized by the Company in preparation of the accompanying financial statements are set forth in Part II,
Item 7 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under the heading Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . There have been no material changes to these policies
since December 31, 2023. 

Changes
in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 

On
April 1, 2024, the Company made a change with respect to its independent auditing firm, ending the relationship with BF Borgers, CPA
PC (BFB) and engaging Wolf Company, P.C. On May 3, 2024, the Company became aware that BFB had agreed to be suspended from appearing
or practicing before the SEC. Because of this, the Company was no longer use audit reports or consent from BFB in future filings. Without
the 2023 audit report, the Company s new auditors needed to perform procedures related to 2023 balances in order to be able to
perform an effective review of required 2024 filings, including the Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024.
Until this was completed, the Company was not able to issue filings during 2024. The Company issued these filings on September 25 and
September 26, 2024, respectfully.

(a)
Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed
or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Commission s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods required by the Commission s rules and forms. 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
(principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of these disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of September 30, 2024. Based
on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer)
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q due to the material weaknesses described below.

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. 

Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making our assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

A
material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant s annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of our evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting,
management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: 

We lacked a sufficient
 number of accounting professionals with the necessary knowledge, experience and training to adequately account for significant, unusual
 transactions that resulted in misapplications of GAAP, particularly with regard to the timing of recognition of certain non-cash
 charges, and 

We are overly dependent
 upon our Acting Chief Financial Officer, who at present is our Chief Executive Officer, within an environment that is highly manual
 in nature. 

As
a result of the material weaknesses, we have concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of September 30, 2024. 

Part

material adverse effect upon our financial condition, cash flows or future results of operation.
