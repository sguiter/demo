 million milestone payment under our Funding Agreement (described in Note 10) upon obtaining the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA approval of acoramidis. We plan to alleviate substantial doubt by obtaining the million milestone payment under our Funding Agreement together with product revenues from the commercial sale of acoramidis, if approved. Although we anticipate receiving FDA approval for acoramidis in late November 2024, we cannot guarantee that we will receive such approval or the resulting milestone payment on a timely basis, or at all, or that we will generate the expected product revenues from the sale of acoramidis, and we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us. Failure to obtain FDA approval for acoramidis will result in our inability to receive the million milestone payment pursuant to the Funding Agreement, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that in the event we require additional financing, such financing will be available.

 of the outstanding voting shares of the entity and that other equity holders do not have substantive voting, participating or liquidation rights. We assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE or whether we have a majority voting interest for entities consolidated under the VOE model at the inception of the arrangement and at each reporting date. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the United States and applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of our financial position, our results of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders deficit and our cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for any other future annual or interim periods. 
 or less from the purchase date to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts invested in money market instruments, such as money market funds and U.S. treasury bills. Marketable securities consist of high investment grade fixed income securities that are primarily invested in U.S. treasury bills. We classify marketable securities as available-for-sale securities and report them at fair value in Cash and cash equivalents or Marketable securities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets with related unrealized gains and losses included as a component of stockholders deficit. We classify marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument s underlying contractual maturity date. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity which is included in Interest income on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are included in Other income (expense), net. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had marketable securities. Our cash and cash equivalents are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the third parties that hold or issue such assets. Our cash and cash equivalents are held by financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. Our investment policy limits investments to fixed income securities denominated and payable in U.S. dollars such as commercial paper, U.S. government obligations, treasury bills, and money market funds, and places restrictions on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer.

 of proceeds, net of certain permitted costs, received from certain asset sale transactions into escrow accounts to be controlled by the Administrative Agent. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we received million in aggregate from Bayer Consumer Care AG and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd, and deposited net proceeds of million into the escrow accounts, which was classified as Restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Furthermore, under the terms of the Amended Financing Agreement (as defined in Note 9), between June 20, 2024 and through the earlier of the FDA approval date of a first NDA for acoramidis and November 30, 2024, the Company is able to request a release of funds in an aggregate amount not to exceed of the original net cash proceeds received from asset sale transactions. As of September 30, 2024, million was released from the escrow accounts and classified as cash, with a remaining balance of million in the escrow accounts classified as Restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 9 and Note 11 for further details regarding the Financing Agreement and the exclusive license agreements with Bayer Consumer Care AG and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. As of December 31, 2023, the use of such non-interest-bearing cash was restricted per the terms of the underlying amended Loan and Security Agreement and was to be used solely for certain research and development expenses directly attributable to the performance of obligations associated with the Navire-BMS License Agreement, which is further described in Note 11. As of December 31, 2023, restricted cash related to this agreement was million, which is presented as part of Restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Upon the termination of the Loan and Security Agreement and full repayment of the term loan in January 2024 (refer to Note 9 for details) the non-interest-bearing cash was no longer restricted. Additionally, under certain lease agreements and letters of credit, we have pledged cash and cash equivalents as collateral. As of September 30, 2024, restricted cash related to such agreements was million and million, which is presented as part of Restricted cash and Other assets , respectively, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, restricted cash related to such agreements was million and million, which is presented as part of Restricted cash and Other assets , respectively, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 million of tranched financing to GondolaBio, of which million had been contributed as of September 30, 2024. The Company contributed certain assets and its equity in Portal Therapeutics, Inc. and Sub21, Inc. to GondolaBio. Upon completion of the initial contributions, the Company s equity ownership in GondolaBio was , which had a fair value of million, and will be subject to reduction as additional tranches of capital contributions are funded. On August 16, 2024, in conjunction with the Transaction Agreement, GondolaBio s limited liability company agreement was amended and restated to reflect a change in its governance structure and composition of the board of managers, which was determined to be a VIE reconsideration event. Based on the VIE reconsideration assessment, GondolaBio was deemed a VIE. As a result of the change in governance structure and composition of the board of managers, BridgeBio is no longer the primary beneficiary, as it no longer has the power over key decisions that significantly impact GondolaBio s economic performance. Accordingly, BridgeBio deconsolidated GondolaBio, inclusive of Portal Therapeutics, Inc. and

 million private equity financing with external investors of TheRas, Inc., to accelerate the development of its oncology portfolio. Upon completion of the private equity financing, Company ownership was reduced to of TheRas equity. As part of the private equity financing transaction, TheRas Certificate of Incorporation and Investors Rights Agreement were amended and restated to reflect a change in TheRas governance structure and composition of the board of directors, which was determined to be a VIE reconsideration event. Based on the VIE reconsideration assessment, TheRas was deemed a VIE. As a result of the change in governance structure and composition of the board of directors, BridgeBio is no longer the primary beneficiary, as it no longer has the power over key decisions that significantly impact TheRas economic performance. Accordingly, BridgeBio deconsolidated TheRas, Inc. and accounted for BridgeBio s retained investment in TheRas, Inc., for which it has significant influence through its ownership interest, using the equity method of accounting as of April 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2020, we had an equity method and equity security investments in PellePharm. The equity security investments in PellePharm were without a readily determinable fair value and were carried at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes. PellePharm became a consolidated VIE in April 2021 under ASC 810 Consolidation . On January 16, 2023, PellePharm s board of directors authorized the assignment of all PellePharm s assets to PellePharm ABC, LLC for liquidation and distribution under the General Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors ABC ). As part of the ABC proceedings, PellePharm s board of directors resigned effective March 6, 2023. The date the board of directors resigned was determined to be a VIE reconsideration event. Based on the changes to PellePharm s governance structure and composition of the board of directors as a result of the ABC, BridgeBio was no longer the primary beneficiary, as it no longer had the power over key decisions that significantly impact PellePharm s economic performance. Accordingly, BridgeBio deconsolidated PellePharm effective during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion on the GondolaBio, TheRas and PellePharm investments.

There were transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the periods presented. There are uncertainties on the fair value measurement of the instrument classified under Level 3 due to the use of unobservable inputs and interrelationships between these unobservable inputs, which could result in higher or lower fair value measurements. Investments in Equity Securities We have investments in equity securities of publicly held companies and we do not have restrictions on our ability to sell these securities. We have classified our investments in equity securities within Level 1, as the fair value of these equity securities are derived from observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets. Our investments in equity securities, which only consisted of an investment in LianBio, had an aggregate fair value of as of September 30, 2024 (refer to Note 6).

Capped Call and Share Repurchase Transactions with Respect to the Notes On each of January 25, 2021 and March 4, 2020, concurrently with the pricing of the 2029 Notes and 2027 Notes, respectively, we entered into separate privately negotiated capped call transactions (the 2021 Capped Call Transactions and the 2020 Capped Call Transactions , respectively), or, together, the Capped Call Transactions, with certain financial institutions, or the Capped Call Counterparties. We used approximately million and million of the net proceeds from the 2021 Note Offering and 2020 Note Offering, respectively, to pay for the cost of the respective Capped Call Transactions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to BridgeBio s common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap initially equal to for the 2021 Capped Call Transactions and for the 2020 Capped Call Transactions (both of which represented a premium of over the last reported sale price of BridgeBio s common stock on the date of the Capped Call Transactions) and are subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. The 2021 Capped Calls and 2020 Capped Calls cover shares and shares, respectively, of our common stock (subject to anti-dilution and certain other adjustments), which are the same number of shares of common stock that initially underlie the Notes. The 2021 Capped Calls have an initial strike price of approximately per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2029 Notes. The 2020 Capped Calls have an initial strike price of approximately per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2027 Notes. The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions, entered into by us with the Capped Call Counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Notes. These Capped Call instruments meet the conditions outlined in ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging, to be classified in stockholders equity and are not subsequently remeasured as long as the conditions for equity classification continue to be met. We recorded a reduction to additional paid-in capital of approximately million and million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the premium payments for the Capped Call Transactions. Additionally, we used approximately million and million of the net proceeds from the 2021 Note Offering and 2020 Note Offering to repurchase shares and shares, respectively, of our common stock concurrently with the closing of the Note Offerings from certain of the Notes Initial Purchasers in privately negotiated transactions. The agreed purchase price per share of common stock in the repurchases were and , which were the last reported sale prices per share of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or Nasdaq, on January 25, 2021 and March 4, 2020, respectively. The shares repurchased were recorded as Treasury stock.

In return, the Company granted the Purchasers the right to receive payments (the Royalty Interest Payments equal to of the global Net Sales of acoramidis Net Sales ). Each Royalty Interest Payment will become payable to the Purchasers on a quarterly basis after the Funding Date. In addition, the Seller Parties granted the collateral agent, for the benefit of the Purchasers, a security interest in specific assets related to acoramidis. The Purchasers rights to the Royalty Interest Payments and ownership interest in Net Sales will terminate upon the earlier of the Purchasers receipt of (a) Royalty Interest Payments equal to million Cap Amount and (b) a buy-out payment Buy-Out Payment in an amount determined in accordance with the Funding Agreement but that will not exceed the Cap Amount. In the event that a change in control (as customarily defined in the Funding Agreement) occurs on or after the effective date of the Funding Agreement and prior to FDA approval of acoramidis, either party may terminate the Funding Agreement and the Seller Parties shall make a one-time payment of million (in the aggregate) to the Purchasers.

 million, which was received in full in May 2024, and will be eligible to receive up to million in regulatory and sales milestone payments through 2026 (of which million is for a regulatory milestone dependent upon EU Commission Regulatory approval of acoramidis on or before December 31, 2025) , and additional payments up to million subject to the achievement of certain sales milestones. In addition, the Seller Parties are entitled to receive royalties according to a tiered structure starting in the low-thirties percent on net sales by Bayer of acoramidis in the Licensed Territory, subject to reduction under certain circumstances as provided in the Bayer Agreement. Unless earlier terminated, the Bayer Agreement will expire at the end of the royalty term for a licensed product, provided that the licenses granted to Bayer for such licensed product survive such expiration on a non-exclusive basis. Either party may terminate the Agreement in the event of a material breach or insolvency of the other party or in the event merger control proceedings are started and clearances are not obtained. Additionally, Bayer may terminate the Bayer Agreement for convenience upon at least days prior written notice, and the Seller Parties may terminate the Bayer Agreement in the event Bayer ceases exploitation of acoramidis under certain circumstances or challenges the validity or enforceability of the Seller Parties patent rights. We determined that the Bayer Agreement falls within the scope of ASC 606 as Bayer is a customer in this arrangement, and we identified the following performance obligations in the agreement: an exclusive license to develop and commercialize acoramidis in the Licensed Territory and the related know-how; and 

 research and development services to conduct ongoing clinical trials. 

 We determined that the performance obligations outlined above are capable of being distinct and distinct with the context of the contract given such rights and activities are independent of each other. The license can be used by Bayer without the development services. Similarly, those services provide a distinct benefit to Bayer within the context of the contract, separate from the license, as the services could be provided by Bayer or another third party without our assistance. We determined the initial transaction price at inception of the Bayer Agreement to be million, which is comprised of the fixed and non-refundable upfront payment. additional development or sales milestone payments are included in the transaction price, as all such payments are variable consideration that are fully constrained as of September 30, 2024. We include variable consideration in our transaction price to the extent that it is probable that it will not result in a significant revenue reversal when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. As part of management s evaluation of the variable consideration, we considered numerous factors, including the fact that achievement of the milestones is outside of our control, contingent upon the success of our existing clinical trials, Bayer s efforts, and receipt of regulatory approval that is subject to scientific risks of success. Royalty arrangements and commercial-based milestones will be recognized when the sales occur or the milestones are achieved pursuant to the sales-based royalty exception under ASC 606 because the license is the predominant item to which the royalties or commercial-based milestones relate. We will re-evaluate the transaction price at each reporting period and as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur. We allocated the transaction price of million based on the stand-alone selling prices SSP of each of the performance obligations as follows: million for the upfront transfer of the license; and 

 million for the research and development services to conduct the ongoing clinical trials. 

 The SSP for the license was determined using an approach that considered discounted, probability-weighted cash flows related to the license transferred. The SSP for the ongoing research and development services were based on estimates of the associated effort and cost of these services, adjusted for a reasonable gross profit margin that would be expected to be realized under similar contracts.

Our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 includes a deferred revenue balance of million million presented as Deferred revenue, current portion and million included in Deferred revenue, net of current portion related to our research and development services obligations. In addition, under the terms of the Financing Agreement, the Bayer Agreement represents an asset sale transaction that requires the Company to deposit of proceeds, net of certain permitted costs, received from the transaction into an escrow account to be controlled by the Administrative Agent. In May 2024, we deposited million into the escrow account from the receipt of the million from Bayer. Ref er to Note 9 for further details regarding the Financing Agreement. In June 2024, BridgeBio Europe B.V. BridgeBio B.V. entered into a commercial supply agreement with Bayer Bayer Supply Agreement with an initial 30-month term ending in December 2026, for which BridgeBio B.V. will manufacture and supply to Bayer the commercial product ordered by Bayer solely for the use in the commercialization in the Licensed Territory under the Bayer Agreement. Under the Bayer Supply Agreement, Bayer shall pay to BridgeBio B.V. a commercial product per unit price equal to the applicable fully burdened manufacturing cost per unit of product, which shall include the cost of the active pharmaceutical ingredient API used to manufacture the product and the packaging price. As of September 30, 2024 , there have been commercial product supply sales to Bayer. Kyowa Kirin Exclusive License On February 7, 2024, the Company s subsidiary, QED, and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd Kyowa Kirin or KKC entered into a partnership wherein QED granted Kyowa Kirin an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize infigratinib for achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, and other skeletal dysplasias in Japan, in accordance with the terms therein (the KKC Agreement ). In exchange, QED received an upfront payment of million in June 2024, and will be eligible to receive royalties up to the mid-twenties percent on sales of infigratinib in Japan, with the potential to receive up to million in development and sales-based milestone payments. Unless earlier terminated, the KKC Agreement will expire at the end of the royalty term for a licensed product, provided that the licenses granted to Kyowa Kirin for such licensed product survive such expiration on a non-exclusive basis. Either party may terminate the KKC Agreement in the event of a material breach or insolvency of the other party. Additionally, Kyowa Kirin may terminate the KKC Agreement for convenience upon at least days prior written notice, and QED may terminate the KKC Agreement in the event Kyowa Kirin ceases exploitation of infigratinib under certain circumstances or challenges the validity or enforceability of Kyowa Kirin s patent rights. We determined that the KKC Agreement falls within the scope of ASC 606 as Kyowa Kirin is a customer in this arrangement, and we identified the following performance obligations in the agreement: an exclusive license to develop and commercialize infigratinib for achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and other skeletal dysplasias in Japan and the related know-how; and

 million, which is comprised of the fixed and non-refundable upfront payment. No additional development or sales milestone payments are included in the transaction price, as all such payments are variable consideration that are fully constrained as of September 30, 2024. We include variable consideration in our transaction price to the extent that it is probable that it will not result in a significant revenue reversal when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. As part of management s evaluation of the variable consideration, we considered numerous factors, including the fact that achievement of the milestones is outside of our control, contingent upon the success of our existing and future clinical trials, Kyowa Kirin s efforts, and receipt of regulatory approval that is subject to scientific risks of success. Royalty arrangements and commercial-based milestones will be recognized when the sales occur or the milestones are achieved pursuant to the sales-based royalty exception under ASC 606 because the license is the predominant item to which the royalties or commercial-based milestones relate. We will re-evaluate the transaction price at each reporting period and as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur. We allocated the transaction price of million based on the SSP of each of the performance obligations as follows: million for the upfront transfer of the license; and 

 million for research and development services to conduct the ongoing clinical trials. 

 The SSP for the license was determined using an approach that considered discounted, probability-weighted cash flows related to the license transferred. The SSP for the ongoing research and development services were based on estimates of the associated effort and cost of these services, adjusted for a reasonable gross profit margin that would be expected to be realized under similar contracts. We recognize revenue for each of the two performance obligations as follows: We recognize revenue related to the license at a point in time upon transfer of the rights and control of the license to KKC. The transfer of the rights and control of the license occurred in February 2024, thus we recognized the full amount allocated to the license and related know-how during the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

 We are recognizing revenue relating to the research and development services for the ongoing clinical trials over time using an input method to measure progress by utilizing costs incurred to-date relative to total expected costs. We expect the development services to extend through 2029. We have recognized million and million of revenue relating to this performance obligation during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

 In May 2024, QED and KKC negotiated a letter of agreement to commence manufacturing while a clinical supply agreement was in negotiation. KKC agreed to reimburse QED the full cost incurred for manufacturing. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, QED has been reimbursed million, respectively, in accordance with this letter of agreement, and such costs are included in revenue in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. As of September 30, 2024 , there are outstanding receivables from licensing and collaboration agreements relating to the KKC Agreement within our condensed consolidated balance sheet. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized license revenue of million and million under the KKC Agreement. Our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 includes a deferred revenue balance of million million presented as Deferred revenue, current portion and million included in Deferred revenue, net of current portion related to our research and development services obligation. In addition, under the terms of the Financing Agreement, the KKC Agreement represents an asset sale transaction that requires the Company to deposit of proceeds, net of certain permitted costs, received from the transaction into an escrow account to be controlled by the Administrative Agent.

Based on the terms of the Navire-BMS License Agreement, Navire will continue to lead its ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy and combination therapy trials (collectively, the Phase 1 Trials ), and BMS will lead and fund all other development and commercialization activities. Navire is fully funding the Phase 1 trials with the exception of the combination therapy governed under the 2021 Navire-BMS Agreement. In accordance with the 2021 Navire-BMS Agreement, both parties are sharing all research and development costs equally for this trial. We have recorded all research and development costs for the Phase 1 Trials, as well as the reimbursement for the costs associated with the trial governed by the 2021 Navire-BMS Agreement within Research and development in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. In March 2024, we received written notice from BMS for the termination of the Navire-BMS License Agreement effective June 2024, and all rights and obligations thereunder. In April 2024, Navire and BMS entered into a Clinical Collaboration Termination Agreement which terminated the 2021 Navire-BMS Agreement. Navire and BMS agreed to pursue reasonable efforts to wind down activities under both the Navire-BMS License Agreement and the 2021 Navire-BMS Agreement. As a result of the termination, Navire is no longer entitled to any future unearned development, regulatory or sales-based milestone and royalty payments. However, we may in the future be eligible to receive earned payments for any milestones already achieved prior to termination and for achieving any milestones while closing out the remaining services. We determined that the Navire-BMS License Agreement falls within the scope of ASC 606 as BMS is a customer in this arrangement, and we identified the following performance obligations in the agreement: an exclusive license to develop and commercialize BBP-398 and the related know-how; and 

 research and development services to complete the Phase 1 Trials for BBP-398. 

 We determined that the performance obligations outlined above are capable of being distinct and distinct with the context of the contract given such rights and activities are independent of each other. The license can be used by BMS without the research and development services. Similarly, those services provide a distinct benefit to BMS within the context of the contract, separate from the license, as the services could be provided by BMS or another third party without our assistance. We entered into a clinical supply agreement for supply of clinical quantities of the licensed product for the licensed territory with BMS in March 2023. We determined that the optional right to future products under this supply agreement did not represent a material right. Navire supplied insignificant amounts to BMS as part of the clinical supply agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Navire supplied million to BMS as part of the clinical supply agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. We determined the initial transaction price at inception of the Navire-BMS License Agreement to be million, which is comprised of the fixed and non-refundable upfront payment. additional development, regulatory, or sales milestone payments are included in the transaction price, as all such payments are variable consideration that are fully constrained as of September 30, 2024. We include variable consideration in our transaction price to the extent that it is probable that it will not result in a significant revenue reversal when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. As part of management s evaluation of the variable consideration, we considered numerous factors, including the fact that achievement of the milestones is outside of our control, contingent upon the success of our existing and future clinical trials, BMS efforts, and receipt of regulatory approval that is subject to scientific risks of success. Royalty arrangements and commercial-based milestones will be recognized when the sales occur or the milestones are achieved pursuant to the sales-based royalty exception under ASC 606 because the license is the predominant item to which the royalties or commercial-based milestones relate. We will re-evaluate the transaction price at each reporting period and as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur. We allocated the transaction price of million based on the SSP of each of the performance obligations as follows: million for the upfront transfer of the license; and 

 million for research and development services to complete the Phase 1 Trials of BBP-398. 

 The SSP for the license was determined using an approach that considered discounted, probability-weighted cash flows related to the license transferred. The SSP for the ongoing research and development services were based on estimates of the associated effort and cost of these services, adjusted for a reasonable gross profit margin that would be expected to be realized under similar contracts.

 and million, respectively. Revenue recognized related to this performance obligation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was million and million, respectively. 

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we have recognized and million, respectively, in revenue relating to the Navire-BMS Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we have recognized million and million in revenue, respectively, relating to the Navire-BMS Agreement. As of September 30, 2024 , there are remaining balances in deferred revenue within o ur condensed consolidated balance sheet. Our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 includes a deferred revenue balance of million million presented as Deferred revenue, current portion and million included in Deferred revenue, net of current portion related to our research and development services obligation. License and Collaboration Agreement with Helsinn On March 29, 2021, QED entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Helsinn Healthcare S.A. HHC and Helsinn Therapeutics (U.S.), Inc. HTU , and collectively with HHC, Helsinn (the QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement ), pursuant to which QED granted to HHC exclusive licenses to develop, manufacture and commercialize QED s product candidate, infigratinib, in oncology and all other indications except achondroplasia or any other skeletal dysplasias, worldwide, except for the People s Republic of China, Hong Kong and Macau Greater China ), and under which QED received a co-exclusive license to co-commercialize infigratinib in the United States in the licensed indications. The QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement became effective on April 16, 2021. Upon approval by the FDA in May 2021, QED and HTU co-commercialized infigratinib in the licensed indications in the United States and shared profits and losses on a :50 basis. Additionally, QED and Helsinn shared global, excluding Greater China, research and development costs for infigratinib in the licensed indications at a rate of for QED and for Helsinn. On February 28, 2022, QED and Helsinn amended the QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement (the Amended QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement effective on March 1, 2022. Under the terms of the Amended QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement, Helsinn had an exclusive license to commercialize infigratinib in the United States and was responsible for solely developing, manufacturing and commercializing infigratinib in oncology indications except for achondroplasia or any other skeletal dysplasias worldwide, outside of Greater China. QED retains all rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize infigratinib in skeletal dysplasia, including achondroplasia. The Amended QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement also provided for a transitional period, which extended from the effective date through August 31, 2022, for which QED was contracted to assist in research and development and commercialization activities. The costs related to QED s contracted activities incurred during the transitional period were fully reimbursable by Helsinn and were due to QED subsequent to the transitional period. Helsinn also agreed to reimburse QED s obligation to FMI described in Note 7 as part of the Amended QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement. In recording this transaction, we recognized a corresponding gain as part of Other income (expense), net for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Effective December 21, 2022, QED and Helsinn (the Helsinn Parties ), entered into a Mutual Termination Agreement MTA ), which terminates the Amended QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement and all rights and obligations thereunder. The Helsinn Parties agreed to perform certain close-out services to enable QED to pursue the development, manufacture and commercialization of infigratinib as a potential treatment of non-oncology indications, such as in achondroplasia worldwide, excluding China, Hong Kong, and Macau. As a result of the termination, QED is no longer entitled to any future regulatory or sales-based milestone payments. QED was subject to royalties on net sales of TRUSELTIQ TM through March 31, 2023, at which date Helsinn no longer sold the licensed product. Helsinn permanently discontinued the distribution of TRUSELTIQ TM and the FDA announced the withdrawal of the NDA approval in May 2023, additionally, all clinical investigations under the associated IND are

 million of costs, or QED s obligation to FMI, which are the responsibility of QED. QED reached the threshold of million in January 2023. The activities within the Close-Out Plan were substantially completed in 2023. Upon the effective date of the MTA, outstanding obligations of million million relating to contracted research and development and commercial activities and million relating to the reimbursement of QED s obligation to FMI) under the Amended QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement related to the contracted services during the transitional period became due, of which all payments have been paid in full. In March 2024, QED reduced its obligation to FMI to million and therefore, pursuant to the MTA, QED s responsibility for close-out activities was lowered to this amount and Helsinn s reimbursement of QED s obligation to FMI was reduced from million to million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , QED has incurred immaterial close out costs and the net costs are subject to reimbursement from Helsinn. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, QED has incurred million and million of close-out costs, respectively, of which million and million are subject to reimbursement from Helsinn, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , there is outstanding receivable balance due from Helsinn. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding receivable due from Helsinn was million. The outstanding receivables are presented in Receivables from licensing and collaboration agreements within our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Close-out costs incurred, including Helsinn s reimbursements, are recorded in Restructuring, impairment and related charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, within our condensed consolidated statement of operations (refer to Note 16). The QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement, the Amended QED-Helsinn License Collaboration Agreement, and the MTA are considered to be within the scope of ASC 808 as the parties are active participants and are exposed to the significant risks and rewards of the collaborative activity. The QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement and the Amended QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement are also partially within the scope of ASC 606 for the units of account where Helsinn is identified as a customer. For the units of account in the collaboration arrangement that do not represent a vendor-customer relationship, including the performance of collaborative research and development and commercialization services, we determined that ASC 606 is not appropriate to apply by analogy and applied a reasonable and rational accounting policy election that faithfully depicts the transfer of services to the collaboration partner over the estimated performance period. Reimbursement payments from Helsinn associated with the collaborative research and development and commercialization services are recognized as the related expense is incurred and classified as an offset to the underlying expense and excluded from the transaction price. We evaluated the terms of the QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement and identified Helsinn as a customer with the following two distinct performance obligations: (1) exclusive licenses to develop, manufacture, and commercialize the underlying product, and (2) transfer of inventory within the transitional supply period. The Amended QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement did not give rise to any additional performance obligations. All of the license revenue, million, relating to these units of account accounted for under ASC 606 were recognized in the year ended December 31, 2021. For the unit of account that is within the scope of ASC 808 relating to collaborative research and development services, pursuant to the QED-Helsinn License and Collaboration Agreement, the Amended QED-Helsinn License Collaboration Agreement, and the MTA, we have recognized an immaterial amount of Helsinn s share of research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a reduction to restructuring, impairment and related charges. We have recognized Helsinn s share of research and development expenses of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as a reduction to restructuring, impairment and related charges.

 million upfront payment, which we recognized as license revenue in 2020. We will also have the right to receive future development and sales milestone payments of up to million, and tiered royalty payments from single-digit to low-teens on net sales of the product in licensed territories. We recognized million in license revenue, representing a regulatory milestone payment in 2021. We accounted for the Navire-LianBio License Agreement under ASC 606 and identified the exclusive license as a distinct performance obligation since LianBio can benefit from the license on its own by developing and commercializing the underlying product using its own resources. In addition, we entered into a clinical and commercial supply agreement with LianBio for the licensed territory in July 2022. We determined that the optional right to future products under this supply agreement did not represent a material right. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have not provided any clinical supply to LianBio. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we provided million of clinical supply to LianBio and recorded such amounts within Revenue in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. QED In October 2019, QED entered into an exclusive license agreement with LianBio (the QED-LianBio License Agreement ). Pursuant to the QED-LianBio License Agreement, QED granted to LianBio an exclusive, sublicensable license under the licensed patent rights and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize infigratinib for any and all human prophylactic and therapeutic uses in all cancer indications (including in combination with other therapies) in certain territories outside the United States. Under the QED-LianBio License Agreement, QED received a nonrefundable upfront payment of million and is eligible to receive development and sales milestones payments of up to million and tiered royalties on net sales ranging from the low to mid-teens. In addition, QED also received warrants which entitled QED to purchase of the then-fully diluted shares of one of the subsidiaries of LianBio upon achievement of certain contingent development milestones (refer to Note 6). We accounted for the QED-LianBio License Agreement and the LianBio Exclusivity Agreement as a single transaction under ASC 606 and identified the exclusive license as a distinct performance obligation since LianBio can benefit from the license on its own by developing and commercializing the underlying product using its own resources. In addition, we entered into a clinical supply agreement with LianBio for the licensed territory in November 2021. We determined that LianBio s optional right to future products under this supply agreement did not represent a material right. We have not provided any clinical supplies to LianBio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We provided insignificant amounts of clinical supplies to LianBio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and recorded such amounts within Revenue in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. License Agreement with Alexion In September 2019, Eidos Therapeutics, Inc. Eidos , entered into an exclusive license agreement with Alexion Pharma International Operations Unlimited Company, a subsidiary of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or together Alexion (the Eidos-Alexion License Agreement ), to develop, manufacture, and commercialize in Japan the compound known as acoramidis (previously known as AG10) and any of its various chemical forms and any pharmaceutical products containing acoramidis. Under the Eidos-Alexion License Agreement, Eidos received an upfront nonrefundable payment of million and is eligible to receive million in regulatory milestone payments and royalties in the low-teens based on net sales of acoramidis in Japan. The royalty rate is subject to reduction if Alexion is required to obtain intellectual property rights from third parties to develop, manufacture or commercialize acoramidis in Japan, or upon the introduction of generic competition into market. Eidos also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Alexion, under which Eidos sold to Alexion shares of Eidos common stock at a price per share of , for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million. The excess of the purchase price over the value of the Eidos shares, determined based on the closing price of a share of Eidos common stock of as reported on Nasdaq as of the date of execution, was million and recognized in revenue as part of the upfront payment as discussed below. 

 37 

BRIDGEBIO PHARMA, INC. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

 million upfront fee and million premium paid for Eidos stock for a total upfront payment of million in license revenue upon the effective date of the license agreement in September 2019. Eidos determined that the license was a right to use its intellectual property and as of the effective date, it had provided all necessary information to Alexion to benefit from the license and the license term had begun. In addition, Eidos entered into a clinical supply agreement in July 2020 and may enter into a commercial supply agreement for the licensed territory. Eidos determined that the optional right to future products under these supply agreements does not represent a material right. Eidos has supplied insignificant amounts to Alexion as part of the clinical supply agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and has recorded such amounts within Revenue in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. Receivables from Licensing and Collaboration Agreements Receivables from licensing and collaboration agreements represent valid claims against our partners, customers, biopharmaceutical companies including unbilled receivables and royalty payments due from third parties for licensing the Company s technologies. Unbilled receivables include balances due from our biopharmaceutical customers related to development services and transition-related receivables that are recognized upon incurrence of the costs for the partnered programs but prior to the achievement of contractual billing rights. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had unbilled receivables of million and million, respectively, of which and , respectively, of total unbilled receivables related to one partner. Total receivables from licensing and collaboration agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are million and million, respectively, and are presented as Receivables from licensing and collaboration agreements within our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company evaluates the collectability of its receivables from licensing and collaboration agreements based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of payment partners, and external market factors and provides for an allowance for potential credit losses based on management s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company did t have an allowance for credit losses. 

 , which was recorded as research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, as the acquired assets did not have any alternative future use. Eidos may also be required to make future payments of up to approximately million to Stanford University upon achievement of specific intellectual property, clinical and regulatory milestone events, and pay royalties of up to low single-digit percentages on future net sales, if any. In addition, Eidos is obligated to pay Stanford University a percentage of non-royalty revenue received by Eidos from its sublicensees, with the amount owed decreasing annually for three years based on when the applicable sublicense agreement is executed. Additionally, under the license agreement with Stanford University, we will pay Stanford University a portion of all nonroyalty sublicensing consideration attributable to the sublicense of the licensed compounds. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we incurred and paid million of licensing fees due to Stanford University related to the Company entering into an exclusive

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the research and development expenses QED recognized were in connection with this agreement. Resilience Development and Manufacturing Service Agreements In September 2023, Aspa Therapeutics, Inc. Aspa and Adrenas Therapeutics Inc. Adrenas ), each entered into a Development and Manufacturing Services Agreement (collectively the Resilience DMSAs and a Project Agreement (collectively the Resilience PAs ), (collectively the Resilience Agreements with Resilience US, Inc. Resilience ), for Resilience to provide contract development, manufacturing, testing and related services with respect to therapeutic and pharmaceutical products for the clinical development applications of BBP-812 and BBP-631, respectively. BBP-812 is an intravenous AAV9 investigational drug product intended for the treatment of children with Canavan Disease, under the age of . BBP-631 is an intravenous AAV5 investigational drug product intended for the treatment of adults and children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The Resilience DMSAs have terms and may each be extended for additional periods. Under the Resilience PAs, Resilience will provide Aspa with a cost sharing credit of the lesser of a fixed percentage of certain agreed upon service costs or million. Under the Resilience PAs, Resilience will provide Adrenas with a cost sharing credit of the lesser of a fixed percentage of certain agreed upon service costs or million. In addition to the payments for their share of services performed by Resilience, Aspa and Adrenas may each be required to make future payments of up to million upon achievement of certain development and approval milestone events, and royalty payments (mid-single digits for BBP-812 and low-single digits for BBP-631) based on achievement of certain net sales metrics.

We recorded million and million of stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, for performance-based milestone awards that were achieved during the periods and were settled in cash. Equity-Based Awards of BridgeBio In December 2023, the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan was amended and restated to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance from shares to shares. In June 2024, our stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of our 2021 Amended and Restated Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2021 A R Plan to, among other things, increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by shares. As of September 30, 2024, shares and shares were reserved for future issuances under the 2021 A R Plan and the Amended and Restated 2019 Inducement Equity Plan (the A R 2019 Inducement Plan ), respectively. Pursuant to the Merger Transactions, we also reserved shares in 2021 specifically under the Eidos Award Exchange (the Eidos Award Exchange Plan ), all of which were issued upon execution of the Eidos Award Exchange as discussed below. The 2021 A R Plan, the A R 2019 Inducement Plan and the Eidos Award Exchange Plan are collectively referred herein as the Plans. 2020 Stock and Equity Award Exchange Program (Exchange Program) On April 22, 2020, we completed our 2020 Stock and Equity Award Exchange Program (the Exchange Program for certain subsidiaries, which was an opportunity for eligible controlled entities employees and consultants to exchange their subsidiary equity (including common stock, vested and unvested stock options and RSAs) for BridgeBio equity (including common stock, vested and unvested stock options and RSAs) and/or performance-based milestone awards tied to the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. The Exchange Program aligns our incentive compensation structure for employees and consultants across the BridgeBio group of companies to be consistent with the achievement of our overall corporate goals. In connection with the Exchange Program, we issued awards of BridgeBio equity under the then 2019 Amended and Restated Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2019 A R Plan ), which was amended and restated in December 2021 into the 2021 A R Plan and further amended and restated in June 2024, as mentioned above, to grantees covering shares of common stock, stock options to purchase common stock, shares of RSAs and shares of performance-based RSAs. The exchange also included performance-based milestone awards of up to million to be settled in fully-vested RSAs in the future upon achievement of the milestones. In consideration for all the subsidiaries shares tendered, BridgeBio increased its ownership in controlled entities included in the Exchange Program and the corresponding noncontrolling interest decreased.

 grantees covering shares of common stock, stock options to purchase common stock, and shares of performance-based stock options to purchase common stock. The exchange also included performance-based milestone awards of up to million to be settled in fully-vested RSAs in the future upon achievement of the milestones. 
 We considered the total shares of common stock and equity awards, whether vested or unvested, held by each participant in each controlled entity as the unit of account. The controlled entity s common stock and equity awards in each unit of account was exchanged for a combination of BridgeBio s common stock, time-based vesting equity awards and/or performance-based milestone awards. Other than the exchange of the controlled entity equity awards for performance-based milestone awards, all other exchanged BridgeBio equity awards retained the original vesting conditions. As a result, there was no incremental stock-based compensation expense resulting from the exchange of time-based equity awards. At the completion of the Exchange Program, we determined million of the performance-based milestone awards were probable of achievement and represented the incremental stock-based compensation cost resulting from the modification of time-based equity awards to performance-based milestone awards. These performance-based milestone awards were to be recognized over a period ranging from year to years. There was incremental stock-based compensation cost arising from the completion of the Exchange Program on November 18, 2020. Under ASC 718, we account for such performance-based milestone awards as a liability in Accrued compensation and benefits and in Other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets due to the fixed milestone amount that will be converted into a variable number of shares of BridgeBio s common stock to be granted upon the achievement date. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized stock-based compensation cost associated with performance-based milestone awards. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized a net reversal of million in stock-based compensation cost associated with performance-based milestone awards, which includes reversals totaling million for obligations that were no longer determined to be probable. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 we recognized million and million, respectively, of stock-based compensation cost associated with performance-based milestone awards whereby the milestones were determined to be probable of achievement as of September 30, 2023. Refer to Note 8 for contingent compensation accrued associated with performance-based milestones that are determined to be probable as of September 30, 2024. Performance-based Milestone Awards Apart from the Exchange Program discussed above, we have performance-based milestone compensation arrangements with certain employees and consultants whose vesting is contingent upon meeting various regulatory and development milestones, with fixed monetary amounts known at inception that can be settled in the form of cash or equity at our sole discretion, upon achievement of each contingent milestone. Upon achievement of a contingent milestone and if such performance-based milestone awards are settled in the form of equity, these are satisfied in the form of fully-vested RSAs. We recognize such contingent stock-based compensation expense when the milestone is probable of achievement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized million and million, respectively, of stock-based compensation cost associated with performance-based milestone awards whereby the milestones were determined to be probable of achievement as of September 30, 2024. The million in stock-based compensation associated with performance-based milestone awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes reversals totaling million as the obligation was no longer determined to be probable.

Equity Awards of Eidos Prior to the Eidos Merger Transactions in 2021, Eidos issued its own equity-based awards under the Eidos 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and the Eidos 2018 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (collectively, the Eidos Plans ). Upon closing of the Eidos Merger Transactions, we issued stock options to purchase common stock of BridgeBio and shares of BridgeBio RSUs to employees of Eidos under the Eidos Award Exchange in exchange for their then outstanding common stock options and RSUs under the Eidos Plans (the Replaced Awards ). The awards issued in the Eidos Award Exchange have the same vesting terms and conditions as the Replaced Awards. We evaluated the exchange of the awards as a modification under ASC 718 and recognized incremental compensation cost from such modification.

 provision for income tax for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using statutory rates. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the favorable tax attributes in future tax returns, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related income tax liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. To date, we have not recognized any interest and penalties in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, nor have we accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties. Our unrecognized gross tax benefits would not reduce the estimated annual effective tax rate if recognized because we have recorded a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets.

 Overview 
 BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. we , the Company , or BridgeBio is a new type of biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases. BridgeBio s pipeline of development programs ranges from early science to advanced clinical trials. BridgeBio was founded in 2015 and its team of experienced drug discoverers, developers and innovators are committed to applying advances in genetic medicine to help patients as quickly as possible. Since inception, BridgeBio has created 18 Investigational New Drug applications, or INDs, and had two products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ). We have worked across over 20 disease states at various stages of development. Several of our programs target indications that we believe present the potential for our product candidates, if approved, to target portions of market opportunities of at least 1.0 billion in annual sales. 
 We focus on genetic diseases because they exist at the intersection of high unmet patient need and tractable biology. Our approach is to translate research pioneered at academic laboratories and leading medical institutions into products that we hope will ultimately reach patients. We are able to realize this opportunity through a confluence of scientific advances: (i) identification of the genetic underpinnings of disease as more cost-efficient genome and exome sequencing becomes available; (ii) progress in molecular biology; and (iii) the development and maturation of longitudinal data and retrospective studies that enable the linkage of genes to diseases. We believe that this early-stage innovation represents one of the greatest practical sources for new drug creation. 
 Since our inception in 2015, we have focused substantially all of our efforts and financial resources on acquiring and developing product and technology rights, building our intellectual property portfolio and conducting research and development activities for our product candidates within our wholly-owned subsidiaries and controlled entities, including partially-owned subsidiaries and subsidiaries we consolidate based on our deemed majority control of such entities as determined using either the variable interest entity, or VIE model, or the voting interest entity, or VOE model. To support these activities, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, BridgeBio Services, Inc., (i) identify and secure new programs, (ii) set up new wholly-owned subsidiaries or controlled entities, (iii) recruit key management team members, (iv) raise and allocate capital across the portfolio and (v) provide certain shared services, including accounting, legal, information technology, administrative, and human resources, as well as workspaces. We have not generated any significant revenue from product sales. To date, we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of our equity securities, issuance of convertible notes, debt borrowings, sale of certain assets and, to a lesser extent, upfront and milestone payments from licensing arrangements. 
 We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred net losses of 276.0 million and 482.9 million, respectively. 
 We continue to evaluate our research and development pipelines and restructure our business to streamline costs and expenses. We also continue to explore business opportunities to partner, divest or delay certain research and development programs to drive operational changes in our business processes, efficiencies and cost savings to advance our corporate strategy and development programs. We expect that these initiatives, including restructuring will reduce our operating expenses.

As of November 12, 2024, the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued due to our history of recurring losses from operations incurred since inception and our expectation of continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes we will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 
 We are entitled to receive a 500.0 million milestone payment under our Funding Agreement (described in Note 10 of our condensed consolidated financial statements) upon obtaining the FDA approval of acoramidis. We plan to alleviate substantial doubt by obtaining the 500.0 million milestone payment under our Funding Agreement together with product revenues from the commercial sale of acoramidis, if approved. Although we anticipate receiving FDA approval for acoramidis in late November 2024, we cannot guarantee that we will receive such approval or the resulting milestone payment on a timely basis, or at all, or that we will generate the expected product revenues from the sale of acoramidis, and we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us. Failure to obtain FDA approval for acoramidis will result in our inability to receive the 500.0 million milestone payment pursuant to the Funding Agreement, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that in the event we require additional financing, such financing will be available. 
 Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates at our wholly-owned subsidiaries and controlled entities. While we have undertaken activities in preparation for commercial launch readiness for our late-stage programs and a restructuring initiative to drive operational change in business processes, efficiencies and cost savings, we expect to continue to incur significant operating and net losses for at least the next several years. In addition, we have very limited experience with commercialization, and we may not be able to generate significant revenues from product sales, if any, even if any of our product candidates are approved for commercial sale. Further, we may not realize the anticipated efficiencies and other benefits of our past and any future restructuring initiatives. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, raise additional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending may have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. 
 Since inception through August 16, 2024, Portal Therapeutics, Inc. and Sub21, Inc. were our majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries. On August 16, 2024, we contributed all of our equity ownership in these entities to GondolaBio, LLC and as a result, Portal Therapeutics, Inc. and Sub21, Inc. were deconsolidated in conjunction with the GondolaBio transaction below. 
 GondolaBio was formed on June 5, 2024 and the Company was the sole member. On August 16, 2024, based on the recommendation of a special committee of independent and disinterested directors of BridgeBio, we entered into a transaction agreement (the Transaction Agreement providing for the formation and funding by certain third party investors of GondolaBio, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company GondolaBio ), a legal joint venture entity for the purpose of researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing pharmaceutical products, including certain assets contributed to GondolaBio by BridgeBio. The investors providing financing to GondolaBio consist of an investor syndicate, including Viking Global Investors LP, Patient Square Capital, Sequoia Capital, Frazier Life Sciences, Cormorant Asset Management, Aisling Capital and an entity owned by Neil Kumar, the Company s Chief Executive Officer. The investors have committed 300.0 million of tranched financing to GondolaBio, of which 60.0 million had been contributed as of September 30, 2024. We contributed certain assets and our equity in Portal Therapeutics, Inc. and Sub21, Inc. to GondolaBio. Upon completion of the initial contributions, the Company s equity ownership in GondolaBio was 45.5 , which had a fair value of 50.0 million, and will be subject to reduction as additional tranches of capital contributions are funded. On August 16, 2024, in conjunction with the Transaction Agreement, GondolaBio s limited liability company agreement was amended and restated to reflect a change in its governance structure and composition of the board of managers, which was determined to be a VIE reconsideration event. Based on the VIE reconsideration assessment, GondolaBio was deemed a VIE. As a result of the change in governance structure and composition of the board of managers, we are no longer the primary beneficiary, as we no longer have the power over key decisions that significantly impact GondolaBio s economic performance. Accordingly, we deconsolidated GondolaBio, inclusive of Portal Therapeutics, Inc. and Sub21, Inc., on August 16, 2024. On August 16, 2024, we recognized an approximate 52.0 million net gain from deconsolidation of subsidiaries which is presented on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Upon the deconsolidation of GondolaBio, we accounted for our investment in GondolaBio, for which we had significant influence through our ownership interest, using the equity method of accounting as of August 16, 2024. GondolaBio was also deemed a related party. For the period August 16, 2024 through September 30, 2024, we recognized a net loss from equity method investment of 1.4 million. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate carrying amount of our equity method investment in GondolaBio is 48.6 million and is presented as part of Investment in nonconsolidated entities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

On April 30, 2024, TheRas, Inc., doing business as BridgeBio Oncology Therapeutics (BBOT), a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed a 200.0 million private equity financing with external investors to accelerate the development of its oncology portfolio. As part of the private equity financing transaction, BBOT s Certificate of Incorporation and Investors Rights Agreement were amended and restated to reflect a change in BBOT s governance structure and composition of the board of directors, which was determined to be a VIE reconsideration event. Based on the VIE reconsideration assessment, BBOT was deemed a VIE. As a result of the change in the governance structure and composition of the board of directors, we are no longer the primary beneficiary of BBOT, as we no longer have the power over key decisions that significantly impact BBOT s economic performance. Accordingly, we deconsolidated BBOT on April 30, 2024. On April 30, 2024, we recognized a 126.3 million net gain from deconsolidation of subsidiaries which is presented on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Upon the deconsolidation of BBOT, BridgeBio accounted for its retained investments in BBOT, for which it has significant influence through its ownership interest, using the equity method of accounting. BBOT was also deemed a related party. For the period May 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, we recognized a net loss from equity method investment of 13.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate carrying amount of our equity method investment in BBOT is 111.8 million and is presented as part of Investment in nonconsolidated entities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 On March 1, 2024, certain subsidiaries of BridgeBio, including Eidos Therapeutics, Inc., BridgeBio International GmbH and BridgeBio Europe B.V. (collectively the Seller Parties ), entered into an exclusive license agreement (the Bayer Agreement with Bayer Consumer Care AG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bayer AG Bayer ), to develop and commercialize acoramidis as a treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis in the European Union and all member states of the European Patent Organization (the Licensed Territory ). Under the terms of the Bayer Agreement, the Seller Parties granted Bayer an exclusive license, effective upon the date that certain antitrust clearances have been obtained, to certain of the Seller Parties intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize acoramidis (previously known as AG10) in the Licensed Territory. In consideration for the license grant, the Seller Parties are entitled to receive an upfront payment of 135.0 million and will be eligible to receive up to 175.0 million in regulatory and sales milestone payments through 2026 (of which 75.0 million is for a regulatory milestone dependent upon EU Commission Regulatory approval of acoramidis on or before December 31, 2025), and additional payments up to 450.0 million subject to the achievement of certain sales milestones. In addition, the Seller Parties are entitled to receive royalties according to a tiered structure starting in the low-thirties percent on net sales by Bayer of acoramidis in the Licensed Territory, subject to reduction under certain circumstances as provided in the Bayer Agreement. In June 2024, BridgeBio Europe B.V. BridgeBio B.V. entered into a commercial supply agreement with Bayer Bayer Supply Agreement with an initial 30-month term ending in December 2026, for which BridgeBio B.V. will manufacture and supply to Bayer the commercial product ordered by Bayer solely for the use in the commercialization in the Licensed Territory under the Bayer Agreement. Under the Bayer Supply Agreement, Bayer shall pay to BridgeBio B.V. a commercial product per unit price equal to the applicable fully burdened manufacturing cost per unit of product, which shall include the cost of the API used to manufacture the product and the packaging price. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no commercial product supply sales to Bayer. 
 On February 7, 2024, our subsidiary, QED, and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd Kyowa Kirin or KKC entered into a partnership wherein QED granted Kyowa Kirin an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize infigratinib for achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, and other skeletal dysplasias in Japan in accordance with the terms therein KKC Agreement ). In exchange, QED will receive an upfront payment of 100.0 million and will be eligible to receive royalties up to the mid-twenties percent on sales of infigratinib in Japan, with the potential to receive up to 81.4 million in development and sales-based milestone payments. 
 On January 17, 2024, the Company and each of the guarantors entered into a Financing Agreement, which was amended on February 12, 2024 (the Financing Agreement and June 20, 2024 (the Financing Agreement, as amended by the Second Amendment, the Amended Financing Agreement ), with the lenders party thereto (the Lenders and Blue Owl Capital Corporation, as administrative agent for the Lenders (the Administrative Agent ). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Amended Financing Agreement, the Lenders have agreed to extend a senior secured credit facility to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of up to 750.0 million comprised of (i) an initial term loan in an aggregate principal amount of 450.0 million (the Initial Term Loan and (ii) one or more incremental term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed 300.0 million (collectively, the Incremental Term Loan, and together with the Initial Term Loan, collectively, the Term Loans ), subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions set forth in the Amended Financing Agreement. The Initial Term Loan was funded on January 17, 2024. Incremental Term Loans are available at the Company s and the Lenders mutual consent from time to time after January 17, 2024. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional details regarding this agreement. 
 On January 17, 2024, we and our subsidiaries entered into a Funding Agreement with LSI Financing 1 Designated Activity Company and CPPIB Credit Europe S. r.l. together, the Purchasers ). Pursuant to the Funding Agreement, the Purchasers agreed to pay to the Company 500.0 million (net of certain transaction expenses) upon the first FDA approval of acoramidis, subject to certain conditions relating to the FDA approval and other customary conditions (such date of payment, Funding Date ). In return, we granted the Purchasers the right to receive payments (the Royalty Interest Payments equal to 5 of the global net sales of acoramidis Net Sales ), which under certain conditions may adjust to a maximum rate of 10 in 2027. Each Royalty Interest Payment will become payable to the Purchasers on a quarterly basis after the Funding Date. In addition, the Seller Parties granted the collateral agent, for the benefit of the Purchasers, a security interest in specific assets related to acoramidis. The Funding Agreement will terminate upon customary events, and also in the event the Funding Date does not occur on or prior to May 15, 2025 (in which case either party may 
 51 

terminate the Funding Agreement at no charge and without premium or penalty). As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not received proceeds under the Funding Agreement. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional details regarding this agreement. 
 Due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development, and given our novel therapeutic approaches and the stage of development of our product candidates, we cannot determine and are unable to estimate with certainty the timelines we will require and the costs we will incur for the development of our product candidates. Clinical and preclinical development timelines and costs, and the potential of development success, can differ materially from expectations due to a variety of factors. 
 In January 2022, we committed to a restructuring initiative designed to drive operational changes in our business processes, efficiencies and cost savings to advance our corporate strategy and development programs. The restructuring initiative included, among other components, consolidation and rationalization of our facilities, reprioritization of development programs and the reduction in our workforce. Upon entering into the Bayer Agreement and termination of the Navire-BMS License Agreement in March 2024 (refer to Note 11 for details regarding these transactions) and our announced decision to cease pursuing development of BBP-631, the Company s investigational adeno-associated virus 5 gene therapy, for congenital adrenal hyperplasia CAH in September 2024, we have committed to additional restructuring plans to reprioritize and advance our corporate strategy and development programs. We estimate that we will incur a remaining 6.0 million to 8.0 million in restructuring charges, consisting primarily of winding down costs, exit and other related costs, and severance and employee-related costs. Our estimate of the costs is subject to certain assumptions and actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions. We may also incur additional costs that are not currently foreseeable as we continue to evaluate our restructuring alternatives to drive operational changes in business processes, efficiencies and cost savings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our restructuring, impairment and related charges amounted to 10.9 million and 7.2 million, respectively, which consisted primarily of winding down costs, exit and other related costs, impairments and write-offs of long-lived assets, and severance and employee-related costs.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Investments in Equity Securities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 266.3 million and restricted cash of 139.4 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of 375.9 million, restricted cash of 16.7 million and investments in equity securities of 58.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Under the terms of the Amended Financing Agreement, the Company is required to deposit 75 of proceeds, net of certain permitted costs, received from certain asset sale transactions into an escrow account to be controlled by the Administrative Agent. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we received 235.0 million in aggregate from Bayer and Kyowa Kirin, and deposited net proceeds of 159.3 million into the escrow accounts, which was classified as Restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Furthermore, under the terms of Amended Financing Agreement, between June 20, 2024 and through the earlier of the FDA approval date and November 30, 2024, the Company is able to request a release of funds in an aggregate amount not to exceed 50 of the original net cash proceeds received from asset sale transactions. As of September 30, 2024, 20.0 million was released from the escrow accounts and classified as cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, with a remaining balance of 139.3 million in the escrow accounts classified as restricted cash. Refer to Note 9 and Note 11 for further details regarding the Amended Financing Agreement, the Bayer Agreement and KKC Agreement. Restricted cash as of December 31, 2023 primarily represents funds in a controlled account that was established in connection with the Loan and Security Agreement Amended Loan Agreement that is described in Note 9. The use of such non-interest-bearing cash was restricted per the terms of the underlying amended loan agreement and was to be used solely for certain research and development expenses directly attributable to the performance of obligations associated with the Navire-BMS License Agreement, which is further described in Note 11. Upon the termination of the Amended Loan Agreement and full repayment of the term loan in January 2024 (refer to Note 9 for details), the non-interest-bearing cash was no longer restricted.

Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consists mainly of the recognition of services revenue under the Bayer Agreement and the KKC Agreement. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to the recognition of license revenue for the shipment of clinical supplies to our partners pursuant to our executed supply agreements and services revenue under the Navire-BMS License Agreement. 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consists mainly of 205.3 million from the recognition of the upfront license fee and services revenue under the Bayer Agreement and the KKC Agreement. An additional 9.9 million of revenue was attributable to the remaining services revenue in connection with the Navire-BMS License Agreement as a result of the termination of the agreement. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to the recognition of license revenue for the shipment of clinical supplies to our partners pursuant to our executed supply agreements and services revenue under the Navire-BMS License Agreement. 
 The level of revenue, including license and service revenue, that we recognize depends in part upon the estimated recognition period of the upfront payments allocated to continuing performance obligations, the achievement of milestones and other contingent events, the level of effort incurred for research and development contracted services, and the impact of entering into new licensing and collaboration agreements, if any.

Research and development expenses increased by 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily due to a decrease in licensing fees of 10.1 million, a decrease in stock-based compensation of 2.0 million and a decrease in external costs of 1.4 million, mainly due to the deconsolidation of affiliates, which was partially offset by an increase in personnel costs of 8.7 million. 
 Research and development expenses increased by 50.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 37.1 million and external costs of 22.7 million to support the advancement of research and development for our key programs, which was partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of 9.3 million. 
 Research and development costs consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors, contract manufacturing organizations CMOs ), and contract research organizations, or CROs, purchase of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, in connection with our preclinical, contract manufacturing and clinical development activities; internal costs, such as personnel and facility costs, and are tracked on a program-by-program basis. License fees and other costs incurred after a product candidate has been designated and that are directly related to the product candidate are included in the specific program expense. License fees and other costs incurred prior to designating a product candidate are included in early-stage research programs.

As discussed in Note 16 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, in January 2022, we committed to a restructuring initiative designed to drive operational changes in our business processes, efficiencies and cost savings to advance our corporate strategy and development programs. The restructuring initiative included, among other components, consolidation and rationalization of our facilities, reprioritization of development programs and the reduction in our workforce. Upon entering into the Bayer Agreement and termination of the Navire-BMS License Agreement in March 2024 (refer to Note 11 for details regarding these transactions) and our announced decision to cease pursuing development of BBP-631 for CAH in September 2024, we have committed to additional restructuring plans to reprioritize and advance our corporate strategy and development programs. We estimate that we will incur a remaining 6.0 million to 8.0 million in restructuring charges, consisting primarily of winding down costs, exit and other related costs, and severance and employee-related costs. Our estimate of the costs is subject to certain assumptions and actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions. We may also incur additional costs that are not currently foreseeable as we continue to evaluate our restructuring alternatives to drive operational changes in business processes, efficiencies and cost savings.

Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense incurred under our 2029 Notes issued in January 2021, our 2027 Notes issued in March 2020, our term loan under the Amended Financing Agreement and our term loan under the Amended Loan Agreement. 
 Our outstanding term loan principal balance under our Amended Loan Agreement was fully repaid on January 17, 2024 upon receiving proceeds from the Financing Agreement plus additional cash from our operations, for which we were extended a senior secured credit facility of 450.0 million in an aggregate principal amount for the Initial Term Loan, which is subject to variable interest rates (refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below and Notes 9 for details regarding the Term Loan and the Amended Financing Agreement). As a result of the variable interest rates under our Amended Financing Agreement we expect our interest expense will continue to fluctuate in the future.

Net loss attributable to redeemable convertible noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests in our condensed consolidated statements of operations consists of the portion of the net loss of those consolidated entities that is not allocated to us. Changes in the amount of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests are directly impacted by changes in the net loss of our consolidated entities and are the result of ownership percentage changes. Refer to Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have historically financed our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities, issuance of convertible notes, debt borrowings, and revenue from certain licensing and collaboration agreements and sales of certain assets. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 266.3 million and restricted cash of 139.4 million, including funds held by our wholly-owned subsidiaries and controlled entities, which are available only for specific entity usage. As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding debt was 1.7 billion, net of debt discounts and issuance costs and accretion. 
 Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred net losses of 276.0 million and 482.9 million, respectively and used cash in operations of 325.4 million and 402.9 million, respectively. While we have undertaken activities in preparation for commercial launch readiness for our late-stage programs and a restructuring initiative to drive operational change in business processes, efficiencies and cost savings, we expect to continue to incur significant operating and net losses over the next several years as we continue to fund our drug development and discovery efforts. In particular, to the extent we advance our programs into and through later-stage clinical trials without a partner, we will incur substantial expenses. In addition, we have very limited experience with commercialization, and we may not be able to generate significant revenues from product sales, if any, even if any of our product candidates are approved for commercial sale. Further, we may not realize the anticipated efficiencies and other benefits of our past and any future restructuring initiatives. Our current business plan is also subject to significant uncertainties and risks as a result of, among other factors, our ability to generate product sales sufficient to achieve profitability, which will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of product candidates at our consolidated entities as well as our ability to partner in the development of certain clinical programs, as well as the levels of our operating expenses. 
 Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements include contractual payments related to our 2029 Notes, 2027 Notes and term loan (refer to Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements), obligations under our real estate leases (refer to Note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements), accounts payable, accrued liabilities and the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiative (refer to Note 16 to our condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 We also have performance-based milestone compensation arrangements with certain employees and consultants, whose vesting is contingent upon meeting various regulatory and development milestones, with fixed monetary amounts known at inception that can be settled in the form of cash or equity at our sole election, upon achievement of each contingent milestone (refer to Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 Additionally, we have certain contingent payment obligations under various license and collaboration agreements in which we are required to make milestone payments upon successful completion and achievement of certain intellectual property, clinical, regulatory and sales milestones. We also enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CROs and other vendors for clinical trials and with vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes, which are generally cancelable upon written notice with potential termination charges. 
 We continue to evaluate our research and development pipelines and restructure our business to streamline costs and expenses. We also continue to explore business opportunities to partner, divest or delay certain research and development programs to drive operational changes in our business processes, efficiencies and cost savings to advance our corporate strategy and development programs. We expect that these initiatives, including restructuring, will reduce our operating expenses. 
 As of November 12, 2024, the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued due to our history of recurring losses from operations incurred since inception and our expectation of continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 57 

Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes we will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 
 We are entitled to receive a 500.0 million milestone payment under our Funding Agreement (described in Note 10 of our condensed consolidated financial statements) upon obtaining the FDA approval of acoramidis. We plan to alleviate substantial doubt by obtaining the 500.0 million milestone payment under our Funding Agreement together with product revenues from the commercial sale of acoramidis, if approved. Although we anticipate receiving FDA approval for acoramidis in late November 2024, we cannot guarantee that we will receive such approval or the resulting milestone payment on a timely basis, or at all, or that we will generate the expected product revenues from the sale of acoramidis, and we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us. Failure to obtain FDA approval for acoramidis will result in our inability to receive the 500.0 million milestone payment pursuant to the Funding Agreement, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that in the event we require additional financing, such financing will be available. 
 In addition, we are closely monitoring macroeconomic events, including inflationary pressures and supply chain issues, which may negatively impact our financial and operating results. We will continue to assess our operating costs and expenses and our cash and cash equivalents and, if circumstances warrant, we will make appropriate adjustments to our operating plan. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Receivables from licensing and collaboration agreements. 
 On March 1, 2024, certain subsidiaries of the Company, including Eidos Therapeutics, Inc., BridgeBio International GmbH and BridgeBio Europe B.V. (collectively the Seller Parties ), entered into an exclusive license agreement (the Bayer Agreement with Bayer Consumer Care AG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bayer AG Bayer ), to develop and commercialize acoramidis as a treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis in the European Union and all member states of the European Patent Organization (the Licensed Territory ). Under the terms of the Bayer Agreement, the Seller Parties granted Bayer an exclusive license, effective upon the date that certain antitrust clearances have been obtained, to certain of the Seller Parties intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize acoramidis (previously known as AG10) in the Licensed Territory. In consideration for the license grant, the Seller Parties are entitled to receive an upfront payment of 135.0 million and will be eligible to receive up to 175.0 million in regulatory and sales milestone payments through 2026 (of which 75.0 million is for a regulatory milestone dependent upon EU Commission Regulatory approval of acoramidis on or before December 31, 2025), and additional payments up to 450.0 million subject to the achievement of certain sales milestones. In addition, the Seller Parties are entitled to receive royalties according to a tiered structure starting in the low-thirties percent on net sales by Bayer of acoramidis in the Licensed Territory, subject to reduction under certain circumstances as provided in the Bayer Agreement. 
 On February 7, 2024, our subsidiary, QED, and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd Kyowa Kirin or KKC entered into a partnership wherein QED granted Kyowa Kirin an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize infigratinib for achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, and other skeletal dysplasias in Japan in accordance with the terms therein KKC Agreement ). In exchange, QED will receive an upfront payment of 100.0 million and will be eligible to receive royalties up to the mid-twenties percent on sales of infigratinib in Japan, with the potential to receive up to 81.4 million in development and sales-based milestone payments. 
 Furthermore, under the terms of the Amended Financing Agreement, the Company is required to deposit 75 of proceeds, net of certain permitted costs, received from certain asset sale transactions into an escrow account to be controlled by the Administrative Agent. The Bayer and KKC agreements meet the requirements of asset sale transactions under the terms of the Amended Financing Agreement. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we received 235.0 million in aggregate from Bayer and KKC, and deposited net proceeds of 159.3 million into the escrow accounts, which was classified as Restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Refer to the Term Loan, net section below for details regarding the escrow accounts deposits required for asset sales transactions under the Amended Financing Agreement. 
 Public offerings 
 In March 2024, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the 2024 Follow-on Agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Cantor Fitzgerald Co. and Mizuho Securities USA LLC, as representatives of several underwriters (collectively, the 2024 Underwriters ), relating to an underwritten public offering (the 2024 Follow-on offering of 8,620,690 shares of the Company s common stock, 0.001 par value per share, at a public offering price of 29.00 per share. The Company also granted the 2024 Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase, at the public offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions, up to an additional 1,293,103 shares of Common Stock, which the 2024 Underwriters exercised in full on the closing of the 2024 Follow-on offering. The Company paid the Underwriters a commission of 3.6 of the aggregate gross proceeds received from all sales of the common stock under the Follow-on Agreement. In March 2024, 9,913,793 shares (including the 1,293,103 shares issued upon exercise of the 2024 Underwriters option to purchase additional shares) were issued under the 2024 Follow-on Agreement, for net 
 58 

proceeds of 276.6 million, after deducting underwriting fees and commissions of 10.3 million and deferred offering costs of 0.6 million. 
 In May 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR, or the 2023 Shelf, with the SEC in relation to the registration of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units or any combination thereof. We also concurrently entered into the 2023 ATM Agreement, with Goldman Sachs Co. LLC and SVB Securities LLC or collectively, the ATM Sales Agents, with respect to an at-the-market offering program under which we may issue and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion and pursuant to a prospectus supplement, shares of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to 450.0 million through the ATM Sales Agents. We will pay the ATM Sales Agents a commission of up to 3.0 of the aggregate gross proceeds received from all sales of the common stock under the 2023 ATM Agreement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1,061,991 shares were issued under the ATM Agreement, for net proceeds of 38.1 million, after deducting sales agent fees and commissions of 0.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, we are still eligible to sell up to 345.3 million of our common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement under the 2023 Shelf. 
 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have borrowings under the 2029 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the Term Loan under the Amended Financing Agreement, which are discussed below. 
 2029 Notes, net 
 In January and February 2021, we issued an aggregate principal amount of 747.5 million of our 2029 Notes, pursuant to an Indenture dated January 28, 2021, or the 2029 Notes Indenture, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, or the 2029 Notes Trustee, in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2021 Note Offering, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. 
 The 2029 Notes accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2021, at a rate of 2.25 per year. The 2029 Notes will mature on February 1, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The 2029 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. 
 We received net proceeds from the 2021 Note Offering of approximately 731.4 million, after deducting the 2029 Notes Initial Purchasers discount. There were no direct offering expenses borne by us for the 2029 Notes. We used approximately 61.3 million of the net proceeds from the 2021 Note Offering to pay for the cost of the 2021 Capped Call Transactions and approximately 50.0 million to pay for the repurchase of shares of our common stock. 
 A holder of 2029 Notes may convert all or any portion of its 2029 Notes at its option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November 1, 2028 only under certain circumstances. 
 On or after November 1, 2028 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, a holder may convert all or any portion of its 2029 Notes at any time.

We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2029 Notes, at our option, on a redemption date occurring on or after February 6, 2026 and on or before the 41 st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, under certain circumstances. No sinking fund is provided for the 2029 Notes. If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the 2029 Notes Indenture), holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2029 Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The 2029 Notes Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the 2029 Notes Trustee or the holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of all the Notes plus accrued special interest, if any, to be immediately due and payable. The 2029 Notes are our general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2029 Notes; equal in right of payment with all of our liabilities that are not so subordinated, including our 2027 Notes; effectively junior to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. 
 Refer to Note 9 in our condensed consolidated financial statements for other details, including our future minimum payments under the 2029 Notes. 
 2027 Notes, net 
 In March 2020, we issued an aggregate principal amount of 550.0 million of our 2027 Notes, pursuant to an Indenture dated March 9, 2020, or the Indenture, between BridgeBio and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, or the Trustee, in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2020 Note Offering, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

Upon conversion, the 2027 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. 
 We received net proceeds from the 2020 Note Offering of approximately 537.0 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers discount and offering expenses. We used approximately 49.3 million of the net proceeds from the 2020 Note Offering to pay for the cost of the Capped Call Transactions, and approximately 75.0 million to pay for the repurchases of shares of our common stock in connection with the 2020 Note Offering. 
 A holder of 2027 Notes may convert all or any portion of its 2027 Notes at its option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2026 only under certain circumstances. 
 On or after December 15, 2026 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, a holder may convert all or any portion of its 2027 Notes at any time. 
 We may not redeem the 2027 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the 2027 Notes. If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2027 Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of all the Notes plus accrued special interest, if any, to be immediately due and payable. The 2027 Notes are our general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2027 Notes; equal in right of payment with all of our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. 
 Refer to Note 9 in our condensed consolidated financial statements for other details, including our future minimum payments under the 2027 Notes. 
 Term Loan, net 
 On January 17, 2024, we entered into the Financing Agreement with certain of our subsidiaries party thereto as guarantors, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, which was amended on February 12, 2024. 
 Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Financing Agreement, the Lenders have agreed to extend a senior secured credit facility to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of up to 750.0 million, comprised of (i) an Initial Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of 450.0 million and (ii) one or more Incremental Term Loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed 300.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Agreement. The Initial Term Loan was funded on January 17, 2024. Incremental Term Loans are available at the Company s and the Lenders mutual consent from time to time after January 17, 2024. 
 The obligations of the Company under the Financing Agreement are and will be guaranteed by certain of the Company s existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (such subsidiaries, collectively, the Guarantors ). As security for the obligations of the Company and the Guarantors, each of the Company and the Guarantors are required to grant to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and secured parties, a continuing first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors (including all equity interests owned or hereafter acquired by the Company and the Guarantors), subject to certain customary exceptions. 
 Any outstanding principal on the Term Loans will initially bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (A) in the case of Term Loans bearing interest based on the base rate defined in the Financing Agreement (and which base rate will not be less than 2.00 ), the sum of (i) the base rate plus (ii) 5.75 and (B) in the case of Term Loans bearing interest based on the three-month forward-looking term secured overnight financing rate administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Term SOFR ), the sum of (i) three-month Term SOFR (subject to 1.00 per annum floor), plus (ii) 6.75 . Accrued interest is payable quarterly following the funding of the Initial Term Loan on the Closing Date, on any date of prepayment or repayment of the Term Loans and at maturity. 
 The Company may prepay the Term Loans at any time (in whole or in part) or be required to make mandatory prepayments upon the occurrence of certain customary prepayment events. The mandatory prepayment events include certain permitted asset sales transactions (which include certain sales, leases, assignments, conveyances, transfers, licenses or exchanges of property) that occur prior to the date the FDA approves a first NDA for acoramidis, which would require the Company to deposit 75 of net cash received from such transactions into an escrow account controlled by the Administrative Agent, and the Company may also be subject to a specified disposition fee per transaction for certain asset sale transactions. In certain instances and during certain time periods, prepayments will be subject to customary prepayment fees. The amount of any prepayment fee may vary, but the maximum amount 
 60 

that may be due with any such prepayment would be an amount equal to 3.00 of the Term Loans being prepaid at such time, plus a customary make whole amount. 
 We have entered into asset sales transactions that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 for the exclusive license agreements with Bayer Consumer Care AG and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd, for which the Company is required to deposit 75 of the proceeds, net of certain permitted costs, upon receipt of the upfront payments from Bayer Consumer Care AG and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd, into the escrow accounts. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we received 235.0 million in aggregate from Bayer Consumer Care AG and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd, and deposited net proceeds of 159.3 million into the escrow accounts. Refer to Note 11 for further details regarding the exclusive license agreements with Bayer Consumer Care AG and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. 
 The completion of the 200.0 million private equity financing with external investors of BBOT. was considered an asset sale transaction that was subject to a disposition fee under the Financing Agreement. Accordingly, we paid a disposition fee of 1.1 million to the Administrative Agent in May 2024. Refer to Note 6 for further details regarding the BBOT private equity financing transaction. 
 The Financing Agreement contains affirmative covenants and negative covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries that are customary for financings of this type. Such covenants, among other items, limit the Company s and its subsidiaries ability to (i) incur additional permitted indebtedness, (ii) pay dividends or make certain distributions, (iii) dispose of its and their assets, grant liens and license or permit other encumbrances on its and their assets, (iv) fundamentally alter the nature of their businesses and (v) enter into certain transactions with affiliates. The Company and the Guarantors are also required to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of 70.0 million at all times. The Company and its subsidiaries are permitted to license their intellectual property, dispose of other assets and enter into monetization and royalty transactions, in each case, subject to satisfaction of certain terms and conditions. The Financing Agreement also includes representations, warranties, indemnities and events of default that are customary for financings of this type, including an event of default relating to a change of control of the Company. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Lenders may, among other things, accelerate the Company s obligations under the Financing Agreement. 
 On June 20, 2024, the Company and each of the guarantors entered into the Second Amendment to the Financing Agreement. Under the Amended Financing Agreement, between June 20, 2024 and through the earlier of the FDA approval date and November 30, 2024, the Company is able to request a release of funds in an aggregate amount not to exceed 50 of the original net cash proceeds received from asset sale transactions. As of September 30, 2024, 20.0 million was released from the escrow accounts and classified as cash, with a remaining balance of 139.3 million in the escrow accounts classified as Restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Furthermore, under the Amended Financing Agreement, the minimum qualified cash balance was amended from 70.0 million to 70.0 million plus 40 of any cash released by the Company from the escrow accounts, at all times. As of September 30, 2024, the minimum unrestricted qualified cash balance was 78.0 million.

Net Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 325.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of our net loss of 276.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items totaling 68.5 million, which primarily includes a 178.3 million net gain on the deconsolidation of subsidiaries, 8.1 million net realized gain from investment in equity securities, offset by 65.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, 26.6 million in loss on extinguishment of debt from the repayment of the term loan under the Amended Loan Agreement, net loss from equity method investments of 14.5 million, and 5.4 million in accretion of debt; and 19.1 million in net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The 19.1 million net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities was attributed mainly to an increase in deferred revenue of 20.6 million primarily related to the Bayer Agreement and KKC Agreement, an increase of 15.5 million in accrued research and development liabilities, and an increase of 5.3 million in accounts payable, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 17.5 million and a decrease of 5.6 million in accrued compensation and benefits, which are collectively primarily due to timing of payments. 
 61 

Net cash used in operating activities was 402.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting primarily of our net loss of 482.9 million; adjusted for non-cash items totaling 96.9 million, which primarily includes 71.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, 6.7 million in accrued payment-in-kind interest, and 6.7 million in accretion of debt; and the remaining 16.9 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The 16.9 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities was attributed mainly to a decrease of 10.5 million in accrued research and development liabilities, a decrease of 4.2 million in accrued compensation and benefits, and a decrease of 3.4 million in accounts payable, which are collectively due to timing of payments; a decrease in deferred revenue of 4.5 million due to revenue recognized; a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 3.7 million; and partially offset by a decrease of 11.9 million from licensing and collaboration agreements receivables primarily due to collections. 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 64.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, attributable primarily to 95.0 million in proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, 63.2 million in proceeds from the sale of equity securities, 25.7 million in special cash dividends received from equity securities, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of 93.8 million, purchases of investments in equity securities of 20.3 million and 4.8 million in payments made to FMI for intangible assets. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 54.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, attributable primarily to 82.6 million in maturities of marketable securities and 81.0 million in proceeds from the sale of equity securities, partially offset by purchases of investments in equity securities of 78.3 million and purchases of marketable securities of 29.7 million. 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 274.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of 450.0 million in proceeds from the term loan under the Amended Financing Agreement, and 314.7 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock through public offerings, which includes 276.6 million in net proceeds through the 2024 Follow-on offering and 38.1 million in net proceeds through the ATM offering. These increases were partially offset by the 473.4 million repayment of the term loan under the Amended Loan Agreement, and 16.0 million in issuance costs and discounts associated with the Amended Financing Agreement. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 456.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting primarily of 450.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, which includes 241.3 million in net proceeds from the Private Placement offering, 144.0 million in net proceeds from the 2023 Follow-on offering, and 65.0 million in net proceeds from the ATM offering. In addition, the increase was also driven by 5.2 million in net proceeds from stock option exercises. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as revenues, if any, and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC, except for certain updates to our accounting policy as discussed in Note 2 in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 There have been no significant changes in recently adopted or issued accounting pronouncements from those disclosed in the section titled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC. 
 62 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (current) of 405.7 million. Our cash equivalents consist of amounts invested in money market funds; agency discount notes; and high investment grade fixed income securities that are primarily invested in commercial paper, U.S. government securities and treasury bills. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. We have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates. We do not believe that our cash and cash equivalents have a significant risk of default or illiquidity. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our 2029 Notes and 2027 Notes had principal balances of 747.5 million and 550.0 million, respectively, which bear fixed interest rates that are not subject to variability as a result of changes in interest rates. However, as of September 30, 2024, our term loan under the Amended Financing Agreement had a principal balance of 450.0 million, which bears variable interest rates that are subject to variability as a result of changes in interest rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates applicable to the Amended Financing Agreement would increase our interest expense on our term loan by 0.6 million and 1.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Inflation has decreased during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and is expected to continue to decrease for the near future. Inflationary factors, such as increases in the cost of our raw materials, clinical supplies, interest rates and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date. Significant adverse changes in inflation and prices in the future could result in material losses. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of that date. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 63 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we were not party to any material legal proceedings. In the future, we may become party to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe we are party to any claim or litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse effect on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including under the heading Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements , the risks and uncertainties that we believe are most important for you to consider are discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The risks described below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Other than the risk factors listed below, there are no material changes to the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 We may require substantial additional funding to achieve our business goals. If we are unable to obtain this funding when needed and on acceptable terms, we could be forced to delay, limit or terminate our product development and commercialization efforts. 
 
 Developing and commercializing biopharmaceutical products is expensive and time-consuming, and we may require substantial additional capital to conduct research, preclinical testing and human studies, may establish pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities, and establish and develop quality control, regulatory, marketing, sales and administrative capabilities to support our existing programs and pursue potential additional programs. We are also responsible for the payments to third parties of expenses that may include milestone payments, license maintenance fees and royalties, including in the case of certain of our agreements with academic institutions or other companies from whom intellectual property rights underlying their respective programs have been in-licensed or acquired. Because the outcome of any preclinical or clinical development and regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development, regulatory approval process and commercialization of any future product candidates we may identify. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 305.4 million, of which cash, cash equivalents amounted to 266.3 million, and restricted cash amounted to 139.4 million. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient for the Company to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources. Such financing may dilute our stockholders or restrict our operating activities. Any additional fundraising efforts for us may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates that we may identify and pursue. Moreover, such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. 
 
 Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 
 the time and cost necessary to establish internal commercialization capabilities or enter into collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of acoramidis or any other product candidate, if approved; 

our ability to satisfy the conditions required by the funding of the investment amount under the Funding Agreement; 

the time and cost necessary to complete ongoing and planned clinical trials, including our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials of low-dose infigratinib, and our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of encaleret; 

64 

the time and cost necessary to pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates, and the costs of post-marketing studies that could be required by regulatory authorities; 

the progress, timing, scope and costs of our nonclinical studies, preclinical studies, clinical trials and other related activities, including the ability to enroll patients in a timely manner, for the ongoing and planned clinical trials set forth above, and potential future clinical trials; 

the costs of obtaining adequate clinical and commercial supplies of raw materials and drug products for our product candidates, including gene therapies such as BBP-812 and any other product candidates we may identify and develop; 

our ability to successfully identify and negotiate acceptable terms for third party supply and contract manufacturing agreements with CMOs; 

our ability to successfully commercialize any product candidates that may be approved; 

the manufacturing, selling and marketing costs associated with any product candidates that may be approved, including the cost and timing of expanding our internal sales and marketing capabilities or entering into strategic collaborations with third parties to leverage or access these capabilities; 

the amount and timing of sales and other revenues from any approved products, including the sales price and the availability of adequate third party reimbursement; 

the cash requirements of any future acquisitions or discovery of product candidates; 

the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments; 

the costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in intellectual property rights, products, product candidates and businesses; 

our ability to continue to discover and develop additional product candidates, and the time and costs associated with identifying additional product candidates; 

our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel; and 

the costs of maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio. 

Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit or terminate one or more research or development programs or the commercialization of any product candidates or be unable to expand operations or otherwise capitalize on business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 To date, we have not generated any revenues from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses in each year since our inception and we anticipate that losses may continue for the next several years or until such time as we can generate substantial revenues and achieve profitability. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our management has concluded that there is substantial doubt as to whether we can continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of this Quarterly Report. Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources. For example, we are entitled to receive a 500.0 million milestone payment under our Funding Agreement (described in Note 10 above) upon obtaining FDA approval of acoramidis. Although we anticipate receiving FDA approval for acoramidis in late November 2024, we cannot guarantee that we will receive such approval or the resulting milestone payment on a timely basis, or at all, and we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern may be dependent upon raising additional capital to maintain current operations and continue research and development efforts. There is no assurance, however, that any additional financing or any revenue-generating collaboration will be available when needed or that we will be able to obtain financing or enter into a collaboration on terms acceptable to us.

As of November 12, 2024, the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued due to our recurring losses from operations incurred since inception and our expectation of continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future. 
 
 If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval in one or more jurisdictions for any product candidates that we may identify and develop, our business will be substantially harmed. 
 
 We cannot commercialize a product until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. Approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is lengthy and unpredictable, and depends upon numerous factors, including substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. Approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of nonclinical or clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate s development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the approval or the decision not to approve an application. It is possible that our current product candidates and any other product candidates which we may seek to develop in the future will not ever obtain regulatory approval. We cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or that if approved, any of our product candidates, will be successfully commercialized. 
 
 Obtaining marketing approval is an extensive, lengthy, expensive and inherently uncertain process, and regulatory authorities may delay, limit or deny approval of our product candidates for many reasons, including, but not limited to: 
 
 the inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that the applicable product candidate is safe and effective as a treatment for our targeted indications; 
 
 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design, endpoints or implementation of our clinical trials; 
 
 the population studied in the clinical program may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety or efficacy in the full population for which we seek approval; 
 
 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate; 
 
 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials; 
 
 the data collected from clinical trials of product candidates that we may identify and pursue may not be sufficient to support the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, biologics license application, or BLA, or other submission for regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere; 
 
 we may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate s risk-benefit ratio for its proposed indication is acceptable; 
 
 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications, or facilities of third party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may change in a manner that renders the clinical trial design or data insufficient for approval. 
 
 In addition, even if an NDA, BLA, or other submission for regulatory approval, is filed and accepted for review, the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities may delay their review or approval process or may decline to grant regulatory approval for a variety of reasons. For example, on December 5, 2023 we submitted an application for approval with the FDA for acoramidis but cannot predict when, or if, we will receive a decision on approval from the FDA. The lengthy approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the results of clinical trials and evolving regulatory requirements, may result in our failure to obtain regulatory approval to market product candidates that we may pursue in the United States or elsewhere, which would significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, failure to secure FDA approval for acoramidis will result in our inability to receive a 500.0 million milestone payment pursuant to the Funding Agreement, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Artificial intelligence presents risks and challenges that can impact our business including by posing security risks to our confidential information, proprietary information, and personal data. 
 66 

Issues in the development and use of artificial intelligence, combined with an uncertain regulatory environment, may result in reputational harm, liability, or other adverse consequences to our business operations. As with many technological innovations, artificial intelligence presents risks and challenges that could impact our business. We may adopt and integrate generative artificial intelligence tools into our systems for specific use cases reviewed by legal and information security. Our vendors may incorporate generative artificial intelligence tools into their offerings without disclosing this use to us, and the providers of these generative artificial intelligence tools may not meet existing or rapidly evolving regulatory or industry standards with respect to privacy and data protection and may inhibit our or our vendors ability to maintain an adequate level of service and experience. In addition, we recently partnered with the CarDS Lab at Yale School of Medicine on a study that uses artificial intelligence tools developed by this partner to help address the underdiagnosis of ATTR-CM. If we, our vendors, or our third party partners experience an actual or perceived breach or privacy or security incident because of the use of generative artificial intelligence, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights and confidential information and our reputation and the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed. Further, bad actors around the world use increasingly sophisticated methods, including the use of artificial intelligence, to engage in illegal activities involving the theft and misuse of personal information, confidential information, and intellectual property. Any of these outcomes could damage our reputation, result in the loss of valuable property and information, and adversely impact our business. 
 We have incurred indebtedness under our convertible senior notes and are party to a financing agreement that contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities. 
 In March 2020, we issued the 2027 Notes, pursuant to which we pay interest semiannually in arrears at a rate of 2.50 per year. The 2027 Notes will mature on March 15, 2027 unless earlier converted or repurchased, at which time we will settle any conversions of the 2027 Notes in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. In January and February 2021, we issued the 2029 Notes, pursuant to which we pay interest semiannually in arrears at a rate of 2.25 per year. The 2029 Notes will mature on February 1, 2029 unless earlier converted or repurchased, at which time we will settle any conversions of the 2029 Notes in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. Under certain circumstances, the holders of the 2027 Notes and the 2029 Notes, or collectively, the Notes, may require us to repay all or a portion of the principal and interest outstanding under the Notes in cash prior to their respective maturity dates, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. 
 In January 2024, we entered into the Financing Agreement, pursuant to which the lenders thereunder agreed to extend a senior secured credit facility to us in an aggregate principal amount of up to 750.0 million, comprised of (i) an initial term loan of 450.0 million, or the Initial Term Loan, and (ii) subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Agreement, one or more incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 300.0 million. The Initial Term Loan was funded on January 17, 2024. We are required to make principal payments of 22.5 million on the outstanding balance of the term loans commencing on June 30, 2027 in quarterly installments in amounts and subject to conditions as set forth in the Financing Agreement, including variable interest rates and additional quarterly installments of 10.0 million if our market capitalization is at any time after January 17, 2024 less than 1.5 billion. The stated maturity date of the term loans is January 17, 2029, with two springing earlier maturity dates at 91 days prior to the stated maturity dates of the 2027 Notes and the 2029 Notes, respectively, in each case to the extent there is an aggregate outstanding amount of such notes of more than 50 million on such dates. The Financing Agreement restricts our ability, among other things and subject to certain limited exceptions, to: 
 
 	sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of our business or property; 
 
 	make material changes to our business; 
 
 	enter into transactions resulting in significant changes to the voting control of our stock; 
 
 	make certain changes to our organizational structure; 
 
 	consolidate or merge with other entities or acquire other entities; 
 
 	incur additional indebtedness or create encumbrances on our assets; 
 
 	pay dividends, or make distributions on or repurchase our stock; 
 
 	enter into transactions with our affiliates; 
 
 	make payments in respect of subordinated indebtedness or royalty monetization transactions; or 
 
 	make certain investments. 
 67 

For example, the license agreements that we recently entered into with Bayer Consumer Care AG and Kyowa Kirin Co. are considered permitted asset sale transactions under the Financing Agreement, which requires us to deposit approximately 75 of the proceeds from such transactions, net of certain permitted costs, into an escrow account to be controlled by the Administrative Agent. Furthermore, under the Amended Financing Agreement, between June 20, 2024 and through the earlier of the FDA approval date of a first NDA for acoramidis and November 30, 2024, the Company is able to request a release of funds in an aggregate amount not to exceed 50 of the original net cash proceeds received from asset sale transactions. 
 In addition, we are required to maintain, under the Amended Financing Agreement, a minimum unrestricted qualified cash balance of 70.0 million plus 40 of any cash released by the Company from the escrow account, at all times, and to comply with various operating covenants and default clauses that may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. As of September 30, 2024, the minimum unrestricted qualified cash balance was 78.0 million. As security for the obligations under the Amended Financing Agreement, we and our subsidiaries that are party to the Amended Financing Agreement as guarantors are required to grant to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the lenders and secured parties, a continuing first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries that are party to the Amended Financing Agreement as guarantors (including all equity interests owned or hereafter acquired by us or such subsidiaries), subject to certain exceptions. A breach of any of these covenants or clauses could result in a default under the Amended Financing Agreement, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the facility to become immediately due and payable and cause us to incur additional fees related to an early repayment, or result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
