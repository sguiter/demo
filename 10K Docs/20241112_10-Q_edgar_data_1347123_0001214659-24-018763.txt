and , respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had negative cash flows from operations of . The Company has incurred
operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and anticipates such conditions to continue in the foreseeable
future. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of and accumulated deficit of . The Company
contin ues to face risks similar to those of other companies of similar size in its industry, including,
but not limited the need for successful commercialization of products, the need for additional capital, or financing, to fund operating
losses, protection of proprietary technology, and dependence on key individuals. The Company has funded its operations through the issuance
of common stock and debt instruments, as further discussed in Note 7, Notes payable and Note 9, Common stock 
below.

is included in other assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Pre-launch inventory, consisting of raw materials,
is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. The Company could be required
to write down previously capitalized costs related to pre-launch inventories upon a change in facts and circumstances, including among
other potential factors, a denial or significant delay of approval by regulatory bodies, a delay in commercialization, or other adverse
factors.

 Leasehold improvements 

Long-lived assets, such as
property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for potential impairment, the Company
first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value
of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent
that carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is determined using various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models,
quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, depending on the nature of the asset. For the three and nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not recognize any impairment charges associated with long-lived assets. 

Lease
liabilities and the corresponding right of use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease
term. The discount rate used to calculate the present value is the rate implicit in the lease, or if not readily determinable, the Company s
incremental borrowing rate. The Company s incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay
to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Certain
adjustments to the right of use asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs or incentives received. Lease payments on
operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease. Lease payments on financing leases are recognized
using the effective interest method. See Note 6, Leases for additional disclosure on leases. 

For
all asset classes of its leases, the Company has elected to account for the lease and non-lease components together for existing classes
of underlying assets.

The
Company completed its initial public offering and began trading on the Australian Securities Exchange ASX on November
24, 2021, under the symbol EBR . The ASX uses an electronic system called CHESS for the clearance and settlement of trades
on the ASX. The State of Delaware does not recognize the CHESS system of holding securities or electronic transfers of legal title to
shares. To enable companies to have their securities cleared and settled electronically through CHESS, CHESS depository instruments called
CDIs are issued. CDIs are units of beneficial ownership in shares and are traded in a manner similar to shares of Australian companies
listed on the ASX. The legal title to the shares are held by a depository, CDN, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the ASX, and is
an approved general participant of ASX Settlement. 

In
June 2023, the Company completed an offering of CDIs representing the same number of common stock at Australian dollars
per share, for proceeds of , net of of related issuance costs. In July 2023, the Company issued an additional 
CDIs representing the same number of common stock at Australian dollars per share, for proceeds of , net of of
related issuance costs. 

In
September 2024, the Company completed a fully underwritten institutional placement and the institutional component of a 1-for-20 pro-rata
accelerated non-renounceable entitlement issuance of CDIs representing the same number of common stock at Australian
dollars per share, for proceeds of , net of of related issuance costs. 

In
September 2024, the Company announced the retail component of the fully underwritten 1-for-20 pro-rata non-renounceable
entitlement offer of CDIs representing the same number of common stock at Australian dollars per share. In connection
with the entitlement offer, the Company received a binding commitment from the underwriter to purchase any entitlements not accepted by
the Company s eligible securityholders. As a result, the Company recognized a common stock receivable of which was presented
as a reduction to equity in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and unaudited condensed consolidated statement
of changes in stockholders equity as of September 30, 2024. The Company recorded a corresponding offset of to common
stock to be issued, a component of equity in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and unaudited condensed

shares of common
stock are reserved. The Company may grant options to purchase common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and other
forms of stock-based compensation. Stock options generally vest over four years and expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.
The Board of Directors has the authority to select the employees to whom options are granted and determine the terms of each option, including
i) the number of shares of common stock subject to the option; ii) when the option becomes exercisable; iii) the option exercise price,
which must be at least 100 of the fair market value of the common stock as of the date of grant and iv) the duration of the option, which
may not exceed 10 years. 

As
of September 30, 2024, options to purchase a total of shares of common stock remained outstanding and shares remain
available for grant under the 2021 Plan and remained outstanding outside of the 2021 Plan. As of September 30, 2024, options to
purchase a total of shares of common stock remained outstanding under the 2013 Plan. As of September 30, 2024, shares of
common stock remain available for grant under the 2013 Plan. 

Stock
option activity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was as follows:

Outstanding at September 30, 2024 

Vested and expected to vest at September 30, 2024 

Exercisable at September 30, 2024 

The
fair value of the options granted to employees is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This valuation
model for stock-based compensation expense requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation,
including the expected term (weighted-average period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the volatility
of the Company s common stock, an assumed risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The Company uses the simplified calculation
of expected life and volatility is based on an average of the historical volatilities of the common stock of several publicly traded entities
with characteristics similar to those of the Company. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time
of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option. The Company uses the straight-line method for expense attribution.
The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
was per share and per share, respectively.

has historically incurred net operating losses and maintains a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. Valuation
allowances are recorded when the expected realization of the deferred tax assets does not meet a more likely than not criterion.
Realization of the Company s deferred tax assets are dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, the amount and timing
of which are uncertain. 

The

Contingencies 

The Company is party to various
legal proceedings from time to time. A liability is accrued when a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated. Management believes
that the probability of a material loss with respect to any currently pending legal proceeding is remote. However, litigation is inherently
uncertain, and it is not possible to definitively predict the ultimate disposition of any of these proceedings. The Company does not believe
that there are any pending legal proceedings or other loss contingencies that will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse impact on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Accrued warranty reserves 

The Company accrues for the
estimated cost of product warranties based on historical experience at the time a patient enrolls in the clinical trial. Adjustments to
initial obligations for warranties are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable. Accrued warranty reserves are included

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and related notes and other information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our registration statement on Form 10-12G, as amended, filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission July 30, 2024, as amended by Amendment No. 1 filed on September 18, 2024 and Amendment No.
2 filed on October 23, 2024, and effective as of September 30, 2024 Form 10 ). In addition to historical data, this discussion
contains forward-looking statements about our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and prospects based on
current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other important factors. Our actual results could differ materially
from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those
identified below and those discussed in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Form 10 and the section titled "Forward-Looking Statements"
included therein. Additionally, our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period
in the future. We use words such as "anticipate," "believe," "continue," "could," "estimate,"

Overview 

EBR
is a U.S. based medical device company that is developing the WiSE CRT System, an implantable cardiac pacing system able to provide stimulation
to endocardial heart tissue for the correction of heart rhythm conditions without requiring the use of leads. That implantable investigational
device is part of a cardiac resynchronization therapy CRT ), potentially offering endocardial heart tissue stimulation without
the complications associated with traditional lead-based systems. Cardiac rhythm management CRM systems use leads to conduct
electricity from an implantable pulse generator IPG to electrodes that deliver therapeutic electric pulses to heart tissue.
While leads are a critical part of most CRM systems, they have long been recognized as a primary shortcoming of these systems and are
a leading cause of device failure. 

We
initially developed the WiSE CRT System for use in conjunction with another implanted pacemaker to provide CRT to patients who are unable
to receive CRT from a traditional lead-based system or are at high risk of complications from an upgrade procedure. WiSE CRT technology
is engineered to benefit patients who have not seen success with conventional CRT or face high complication risks. By eliminating lead
requirements for left ventricular pacing, WiSE CRT introduces a novel approach to cardiac pacing, with the potential to transform CRT
delivery. 

We
completed interim enrollment in the pivotal SOLVE-CRT (Stimulation of the Left Ventricular Endocardium for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy)
study in July 2022, and subsequently stopped enrollment as a result of early trial success. The results, presented during a Late Breaking
Clinical Trial session at the 2023 Heart Rhythm Society Conference, showed the study met both its primary efficacy and safety end points.
We have submitted all required modules of our modular pre-market approval PMA to the Food and Drug Administration FDA and will plan to begin commercialization upon final FDA approval. We plan to commercialize the device in Australia and certain European
countries following our U.S. launch and upon obtaining local regulatory approvals and securing reimbursement coverage.

Financial overview 

Since
inception, we have incurred significant net losses and expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Since our inception,
our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds from the sale of our CDIs, common stock, convertible preferred stock, and
indebtedness. As of December 31, 2023, we had 73.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and an accumulated
deficit of 312.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had 74.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and an
accumulated deficit of 343.4 million. 

On
September 25, 2024, we issued 55,856,325 CDIs in connection with an institutional placement and the institutional component of a 1-for-20
pro-rata accelerated non-renounceable entitlement offer on the ASX. We raised approximately 29.5 million, net of issuance costs of approximately
 1.8 million. On October 16, 2024, we issued 5,075,733 CDIs in connection with the retail component of a fully underwritten 1-for-20 pro-rata
non-renounceable entitlement offer. We raised approximately 2.6 million, net of issuance costs of approximately 0.1 million. 

Factors Affecting
Our Business 

There
are a number of factors that have impacted, and we believe will continue to impact, our results of operations and growth. These factors
include: 

Regulatory approvals/clearances . Our business strategy depends on the successful FDA submission
and obtaining approval by the FDA of our WiSE CRT System on a timely basis. 

Market acceptance . If approved, the growth of our business depends on our ability to gain
wide acceptance of our WiSE CRT System by continuing to make physicians and other hospital staff aware of the benefits of WiSE CRT to
generate increased demand and frequency of use, and thus increase sales to our hospital customers. Our ability to grow our business will
also depend on our ability to expand our customer base in existing or new target markets. 

Sales force size and effectiveness . If approved, the rate at which we grow our sales force
and the speed at which newly hired salespeople become effective can impact our revenue growth or our costs incurred in anticipation of
such growth. We intend to make significant investments in our sales and marketing organization by increasing the number of U.S. sales
representatives and expanding our international marketing programs to help facilitate further adoption among existing hospital accounts
as well as broaden awareness of our products to new hospital accounts. 

Competition . Our industry is intensely competitive and, in particular, we compete with a
number of large, well-capitalized companies on multiple fronts. We must strive to be successful in light of our competitors existing
and future products and related pricing and their resources to successfully market to the physicians who use our products. 

Reimbursement . The level of reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed
using our products could have a substantial impact on the prices we are able to charge for our products and how widely our products are
accepted. The level at which reimbursement is set for procedures using our products, and any increase in reimbursement for procedures
using our products, will depend substantially on our ability to generate clinical evidence, to gain advocacy in the respective physician
societies and to work with the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services and payors. 

Clinical results . Publications of clinical results by us, our competitors and other third
parties can have a significant influence on whether, and the degree to which, our products are used by physicians and the procedures and
treatments those physicians choose to administer for a given condition. 

While these factors may present significant opportunities
for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must address.

Components of our Consolidated Results of Operations 

Operating Expenses 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits and other compensation-related
costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for employees engaged in research and development functions. Research and development
expenses also include costs of conducting our ongoing clinical studies, such as expenses associated with our clinical research organization,
or CRO, who provides project management and other services related to our SOLVE-CRT study, outside service fees paid to third
party consultants and contractors related to our product candidate engineering, quality assurance and regulatory approval, as well as
contract manufacturing of our product candidate and allocated facility costs. 

We
expense research and development costs as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments that we make for goods or services to be
received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and other long-term assets, which
are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed, or when it is no longer expected that the goods will be
delivered, or the services rendered. 

The successful development
of product candidates is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of certain risks related to the development of
product candidates and costs of clinical trials, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Form 10. 

We anticipate that our research
and development expenses will increase significantly in the future as we: 

hire and retain additional personnel, including research, clinical, development, manufacturing, quality
control, quality assurance and regulatory personnel; 

conduct additional clinical studies beyond our current SOLVE-CRT study; 

continue to advance the research and development of our WiSE CRT system; 

develop, establish, and validate our commercial-scale current good manufacturing practice cGMP ). 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits and other compensation-related
costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our personnel and external contractors involved in our executive, finance, legal
and other administrative functions as well as our commercial function, who is involved in market access related activities. General and
administrative expenses also include costs incurred for outside services associated with such functions, including costs associated with
obtaining and maintaining our patent portfolio and professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax, legal services, and other consulting
expenses. 

We
anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase significantly in the future as we: 

hire and retain additional general and administrative personnel
to support the expected growth in our research and development activities and the preclinical and clinical development of our product
candidates; 

continue to expand our commercial and administrative function to
support the growth of our WiSE CRT commercialization; 

incur additional commercialization expenses prior to any regulatory
approval of our product candidates; 

pursue payor coverage and reimbursement for our current and future
product candidates; 

maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
and 

incur increased expenses associated with operating as a U.S. publicly
reporting company, including increased costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services, and director
and officer insurance premiums.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our management s discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the United States. The preparation
of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical
experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and recorded amounts of expenses that are
not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

While our significant accounting
policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this
Form 10-Q, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
require the most significant judgments and estimates. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully
understanding and evaluating our audited consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 

Clinical trial accrual 

The clinical trial accrual
involves identifying services that third parties, contracted by us, have performed and estimating the associated cost incurred for these
services which remain uninvoiced as of the balance sheet date. In addition, the clinical trial accrual involves the measurement of milestone
achievements achieved by the patients participating in the clinical trial and the associated costs which have not been invoiced as of
the balance sheet date. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements by matching the appropriate expenses with the period in which services are provided. We account for these expenses according
to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. Our clinical trial accrual
is dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from the third parties. We estimate our liability using our judgment
based upon the facts and circumstances known at the time. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our clinical expense recognition
if actual results differ from our estimates. 

26 

 Table of Contents 

Stock-Based compensation 

We measure all stock
options and other stock-based awards based on their fair value on the date of the grant. Those awards typically have a graded vesting
schedule and compensation expense for awards with only service conditions are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. 

We use the Black-Scholes
option pricing model, which incorporates assumptions and estimates, to measure the fair value of its option awards on the date of grant
of each stock option award. 

We determined the
assumptions for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant
judgment to determine. 

Fair Value of Our Common Stock . Our stock is publicly traded on the ASX, and therefore we use the
closing market price on the day before the option grant. 

Expected Term . The expected term represents the period that the stock-based
awards are expected to be outstanding. As we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which
to estimate the expected term, the expected term of stock options granted has been determined using the simplified method, which is the
average of the midpoints between the vesting date and the contractual term for all vesting tranches. 

Risk-Free Interest Rate . The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate of
the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of
the award. 

Expected Volatility . The expected volatility was derived from the combination of the average historical
stock volatilities of several public companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business, and our stock price,
as quoted on the ASX. 

Dividend Rate . The expected dividend is zero as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying any
dividends in the foreseeable future. 

If any of the assumptions used in the
Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted
previously. 

Income Taxes 

We are subject to income taxes
in the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the United States federal statutory rate,
primarily due to changes in our valuation allowance, stock-based compensation expense, state and foreign tax benefit, federal research
and development tax credits and other adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 0.00 and 0.00 for both the three-month and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The calculation of our provision for income taxes involves the use of estimates, assumptions
and judgments while taking into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future tax audits.
We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. 

Significant management judgement
is required in assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our net deferred tax assets. Due to our history of net losses,
the difficulty in predicting future results, the length of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning alternatives, we believe that
we cannot rely on projections of future taxable income to realize most of our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we have established a
full valuation allowance against our United States federal and states net deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain this valuation allowance
until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the
extent that sufficient positive evidence materializes to support a reversal, or decrease in, our valuation allowance. 

27 

 Table of Contents 

We recognize tax benefits
from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not (more than 50 that the tax position will be sustained on examination
by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions
around the world and a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally
resolved. We have established reserves to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities.
While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position and we can
provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, we believe that we have adequately
reserved for our uncertain tax positions. 

Our future effective tax rates
could be adversely affected if actual earnings are different than our estimates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets
or liabilities, outcomes resulting from income tax examinations, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting
principles.

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September
30, 2024, to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

We recorded a net loss of
 10.1 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.9 million, or 10.1 , from the three-month period ended
September 30, 2023. The increased loss in 2024 was due to an increase in general and administrative expenses in 2024, which was offset
partially by a decrease in research and development, as discussed below. Other (expense) income, net also increased in 2024 due to a decrease
in interest income and increase in loss on foreign currency transactions, as discussed below.

Research and development expenses
decreased by 0.7 million, or 9.5 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.0 million decrease in contract manufacturing, materials and components, resulting from
a decrease in professional services related to the development testing of WiSE CRT System, as well as capitalization of certain inventory
purchases. Clinical trial expenses decreased by 0.4 million due to a decrease in clinical trial activities related to SOLVE-CRT Study.
These decreases were offset by 0.8 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, and certain fringe benefits,
resulting from an expansion in our workforce to support the final development testing of the last module of our PMA submission for the
WiSE CRT System. 

General and Administrative
Expenses 

General and administrative
expenses increased by 1.0 million, or 56.6 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2023. Professional fees increased by 0.7 million, primarily resulting from higher accounting and legal related services
in connection with preparation for the Form 10 filing. Personnel-related expenses including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation
and certain fringe benefits increased by 0.2 million as a result of the expansion of our workforce to support our growth. Corporate expenses
increased by 0.1 million, primarily resulting from the higher expenses related to investor relations. 

Other (expense) income, net 

Other (expense) income, net
increased by 0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.
This increase primarily resulted from 0.4 million decrease in interest income that the company earned on its investments in marketable
securities, including the accretion of discounts on marketable securities, as well as 0.1 million increase in loss on foreign currency
transactions driven by the foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations for the period. 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September
30, 2024, to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

We recorded a net loss of
 30.7 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.0 million, or 24.2 , from the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023. The increased loss in 2024 was due to an increase in research and development and general and administrative expenses
in 2024, as discussed below. Other (expense) income, net also increased in 2024 due to an increase in interest expense and decrease in
other income, which were offset partially by an increase in interest income, as discussed below.

Research and development expenses
increased by 0.9 million, or 4.9 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The increase was primarily due to a 2.1 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, and certain
fringe benefits resulting from an expansion in our workforce to support research, design, testing and development of our WiSE CRT System.
This increase was offset by a 1.1 million decrease in clinical trial expenses, primarily due to a decrease in clinical trial activities
related to SOLVE-CRT Study. 

General and Administrative
Expenses 

General and administrative
expenses increased by 3.2 million, or 61.9 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Professional fees increased by 1.8 million, primarily resulting from higher accounting and legal related services in connection
with preparation for the Form 10 filing. Personnel-related expenses including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and certain
fringe benefits increased by 1.1 million as a result of the expansion of our workforce to support our growth. Corporate expenses increased
by 0.3 million, primarily resulting from the higher expenses related to investor relations. 

Other (expense) income, net 

Other (expense) income, net
increased by 1.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest
expense increased by 1.6 million, which resulted from borrowing tranche 2 in June 2023, under a loan and security agreement, as discussed
below. Additionally, other income has decreased by 0.4 million, primarily resulting from a decrease in refundable tax incentives. These
changes were offset by a 0.1 million increase in interest income, including the accretion of discounts on marketable securities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We believe that we
maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to meet our financial obligations as they become due for the next twelve months.
We manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain its financial condition and maintain flexibility for
future strategic initiatives. We continuously assess our working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturity schedule, capital
expenditure requirements and future investments. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had approximately 74.2 million and
 73.4 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Subsequently, on October 16, 2024, we raised approximately
 2.6 million, net of issuance costs of approximately 0.2 million, from the retail component of a fully underwritten 1-for-20 pro-rata
non-renounceable entitlement offer. In the long-term, our ability to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements
will depend on many factors, including: 

the cost, timing and results of our clinical trials and regulatory reviews; 

the cost of our research and development activities for new and modified products; 

the cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; 

the terms and timing of other collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that
may establish including any contract manufacturing arrangements; 

the timing, receipt and amount of sales from our current and potential products; 

the degree of success we experience in commercializing our products; 

the emergence of competing or complementary technologies; 

the impact of global business, political and macroeconomic conditions, including
inflation, rising interest rates, uncertainty with respect to the federal budget, instability in the global banking system, volatile market
conditions, supply chain disruptions, cybersecurity events, and global events, including regional conflicts around the world; 

the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing
any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and 

the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies,
although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions. 

To
the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and cash and
other requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional
dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments
governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. In the event that additional
financing is required from outside sources, there is a possibility we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all.
Further, the current macroeconomic environment may make it difficult for us to raise capital on terms favorable to us or at all. If we
are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Loan and Security Agreements 

On June 30, 2022, we entered
into a loan and security agreement with Runway Growth Finance Corp. The debt is secured against substantially all of our assets, except
for intellectual property, but includes all proceeds from the sale of intellectual property. The loan agreement provides three term loan
tranches. We received the initial draw of 20,000,000 in June 2022. We received positive interim analysis data, sufficient to proceed
with the clinical trial and premarket approval submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which allowed us to draw the second
tranche of 20,000,000 in June 2023. The final tranche provided 10,000,000 from the date of approval from the FDA for the WiSE CRT System
and ended on June 30, 2024. We did not receive FDA approval by June 30, 2024, and therefore did not meet the draw requirements of the
third and final tranche.

 Table of Contents 

Interest on the term loan
accrues on the principal amount outstanding at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of the rate of interest noted in The Wall
Street Journal Money Rates section, as the Prime Rate or 4.00 plus a margin of 4.9 and is payable monthly in arrears and
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. We are required to make interest only payments
from July 2022 to May 2027. The note payable has a maturity date of June 15, 2027, at which time any unpaid interest, outstanding principal
balance, and a final payment of 4.5 of the original principal amount borrowed shall be due in full. If we repay the loan prior to maturity,
we will be required to pay a prepayment fee of 0.5 - 1 of the outstanding principal balance. We are also required to pay a 3 success
fee of the funded principal amount of the term loan at the time of a liquidity event, as defined in the loan and security agreement. The
success fee is enforceable within 10 years from the execution date of the agreement. 

As of September 30, 2024,
and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance was 41,800,000, which included the principal borrowings under tranche one and
tranche two, as well as the final payment of 4.5 of the principal borrowings to date. 

We are subject to customary
financial and reporting covenants under the loan and security agreement. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance
with all debt covenants. 

Recent Financings 

On
September 25, 2024, we issued 55,856,325 CDIs in connection with an institutional placement and the institutional component of a 1-for-20
pro-rata accelerated non-renounceable entitlement offer on the ASX. We raised approximately 29.5 million, net of issuance costs of approximately
 1.8 million. On October 16, 2024, we issued 5,075,733 CDIs in connection with the retail component of a fully underwritten 1-for-20 pro-rata
non-renounceable entitlement offer. We raised approximately 2.6 million, net of issuance costs of approximately 0.1 million. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

As
of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had 1.2 million and 1.9 million in operating lease obligations, respectively, for our
corporate headquarters and laboratory space, located in Sunnyvale, California. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the outstanding
principal balance under our loan and security agreement described above was 41,800,000, which included the principal borrowings under
tranche one and tranche two, as well as the final payment of 4.5 of the principal borrowings to date. 

In addition, we have entered
into an equipment purchase agreement for the purchase of certain software. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the outstanding
principal balance was 59,657 and 21,496, respectively. Additionally, we enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third-party
contract organizations for clinical trials, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes. In certain instances,
our purchase agreements allow us to cancel, reschedule, or adjust our purchase requirements based on our business needs prior to firm
orders being placed. Consequently, only a portion of our purchase commitments are firm and noncancelable. As of September 30, 2024, and
December 31, 2023, our obligations under such arrangements were approximately 12.5 million and 3.5 million, respectively. 

Other than as described above,
there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and other commitments compared to those disclosed in our Form 10. 

Working Capital 

September 30, 2024, Compared to December 31,
2023 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had working capital of 67.9 million, comprised of current assets of 74.6 million and current liabilities of 6.7 million. Current
assets, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, prepaid expenses, non-trade receivables and other current assets,
increased by 0.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. Current liabilities, consisting primarily of accounts
payable, accrued liabilities, lease obligations, the current portion of notes payable and interest payable, increased by approximately
 0.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. The sale of common stock discussed above contributed to the overall
increase in cash and cash equivalents, resulting in an increase in working capital as of September 30, 2024.

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 30.2 million, compared to 23.2 million during the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, representing an increase in use of 7.0 million. This increase is primarily attributed to an increase in net loss
of 6.0 million, a decrease in non-cash adjustments of 0.1 million, and a use of cash from changes in working capital of 0.9 million. 

The increase in net loss of 6.0 million resulted from increases in personnel costs due to the expansion
of our workforce, increases in professional fees due to the preparation for the Form 10 filing, and increase other expense mainly driven
by interest expense, as further described under Results of Operations above. 

Non-cash items primarily consisted of increases in share-based compensation of 0.4 million due to new
options issuance to new hires and existing employees, offset by a decrease in accretion of discount on marketable securities of 0.5 million
driven by fluctuating interest rates and maturity term. 

The increase in changes from working capital activities primarily consisted of a 0.9 million increase
in accounts payable due to the timing of invoice payments, as well as 0.2 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities
primarily driven by lower clinical trial expenses. This increase was partially offset by 1.4 million use of cash for other assets mainly
due to capitalization of certain raw materials during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 0.5 million decrease in prepaids expenses
due to decreased vendor prepayment requirements for research and development materials and professional services, and a 0.1 million decrease
in interest payable. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash provided by investing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 22.3 million, compared to 11.4 million the nine months ended September
30, 2023, representing an increase in cash provided of 10.9 million. The increase was attributable to a 10.1 million decrease in the
purchase of marketable securities, as well as a 0.8 million increase in cash from the maturities and sales of marketable securities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 29.8 million, compared to 40.5 million during the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of 10.7 million. This decrease is primarily attributed to the 19.7 million borrowing, net
of issuance cost, under tranche 2 of the loan and security during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was partially
offset by 8.9 million increase in proceeds from a capital raise, net of issuance cost, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
as well as by a 0.1 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options.

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and are not required to provide the information specified under this item. 

ITEM
4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective
and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based
on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during
the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
and Procedures 

In designing and evaluating
disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance, and not absolute assurance, that the desired control objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design
of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent
limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals in all future circumstances.
Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
our disclosure control system are met and, as set forth above, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded,
based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were met. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION

1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may
become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings that, in
the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have
an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
