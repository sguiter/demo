 million matured on April 30, 2024. We entered into the contract to manage the variability of cash flows associated with approximately one-half of our variable rate debt. The contract required periodic interest rate settlements, and we received a floating rate based on the greater of 1-month SOFR or and paid a fixed rate of on the outstanding notional amount. 
 
 The interest rate swap was designated as a cash flow hedge and the effectiveness of the hedge was assessed both at the onset of the hedge and at regular intervals throughout the life of the derivative. As the interest rate swap was highly effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the fair value of the derivative were included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on our condensed consolidated balance sheets through the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. 
 
 On March 1, 2024, we repaid our variable rate debt in full and reclassified an unrealized gain of million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. The net amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss reclassified to interest expense during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. 
 
 The following table presents our interest rate swap contract where the notional amount was equal to approximately one-half of the corresponding reduction in the balance of our term loan. The fair value of the derivative represented the discounted value of the expected future discounted cash flows for the interest rate swap, based on the payment schedule and the current forward curve for the remaining term of the contract, as of the date of each reporting period:

 The acquisition consideration for MarkLogic has been allocated to MarkLogic s tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The excess of total consideration over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill. 
 
 During the first fiscal quarter of 2024, the measurement period adjustments were completed, which resulted in a million increase in goodwill. The purchase price allocation is now complete.

 Acquisition-related transaction costs (e.g., legal, due diligence, valuation, and other professional fees) and certain acquisition restructuring and related charges are not included as a component of consideration transferred but are required to be expensed as incurred. 
 
 We determined that disclosing the amount of MarkLogic related earnings included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations is impracticable, as certain operations of MarkLogic were integrated into the operations of the Company from the date of acquisition. 
 
 Pro Forma Information 
 
 The following pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations of Progress and MarkLogic as if the acquisition had occurred on December 1, 2021, after giving effect to certain pro forma adjustments. The pro forma adjustments reflected herein include only those adjustments that are directly attributable to the MarkLogic acquisition and factually supportable. These pro forma adjustments include: (i) a net increase in amortization expense to record amortization expense relating to the million of acquired identifiable intangible assets, (ii) an increase in interest expense to record interest for the period presented as a result of drawing down our revolving line of credit in connection with the acquisition, and (iii) the income tax effect of the adjustments made at the statutory tax rate of the U.S. (approximately 24.5 ). 
 
 The pro forma financial information does not reflect any adjustments for anticipated expense savings resulting from the acquisition and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have actually occurred had the transaction been consummated on December 1, 2021.

 million, due March 1, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The proceeds from the 2030 Notes were used in part to enter into the 2024 Capped Call Transactions, described below, for working capital, and for other general corporate purposes, including paying off the existing term loan and revolving line of credit. There are no required principal payments prior to the maturity of the 2030 Notes. The 2030 Notes bear interest at an annual rate of , payable semi-annually in arrears on September 1 and March 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024. The Company incurred approximately million in issuance costs for the issuance of the 2030 Notes. 
 
 Conversion Rights 
 
 Before November 1, 2029, Noteholders may convert their 2030 Notes in the following circumstances: 
 
 During any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on May 31, 2024, if the last reported sale price per share of the Company s common stock exceeds of the conversion price for each of at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter; or 
 During the consecutive business days immediately after any consecutive trading day period (the Measurement Period ), if the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price per share of Company s common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; or 
 Upon the occurrence of distributions on the Company s common stock, which distribution per share of common stock has a value exceeding of the last reported sale price per share on the trading day immediately before the date such distribution is announced; or 
 Upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or if the Company calls such Notes for redemption, then the Noteholder of any Note may convert such Note. 
 
 From and after November 1, 2029, Noteholders may convert their 2030 Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will satisfy its conversion obligations by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of 2030 Notes to be converted, by issuing shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election. The initial conversion rate is 14.7622 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the 2030 Notes, representing an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including spin-offs, tender offers, exchange offers, make-whole fundamental change and certain stockholder distributions. 
 
 Repurchase Rights 
 
 On or after March 5, 2027, and on or before the 60th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the 2030 Notes, subject to partial redemption limitation, at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the last reported sale price per share of the Company s common stock exceeded of the conversion price on (1) each of at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides a redemption notice and (2) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. Pursuant to the partial redemption limitation, the Company may not elect to redeem less than all of the outstanding 2030 Notes unless at least million aggregate principal amount of 2030 Notes are outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the time it sends the related redemption notice.

million shares of the Company s common stock, which represent the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the 2030 Notes. The 2024 Capped Call Transactions are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the 2030 Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the 2024 Capped Call Transactions will initially be per share of common stock, which represents a premium of over the last reported sale price of the common stock of per share on February 27, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 2024 Capped Call Transactions. The cost of the purchased capped calls of million was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in-capital upon settlement in March 2024. 
 
 Accounting for the 2030 Notes 
 
 The 2030 Notes are classified as a non-current liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and the conversion option does not require bifurcation as an embedded derivative. Issuance costs of million were recorded as a reduction to the principal balance of the 2030 Notes and will be amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term.

 Credit Facility 
 
 On March 7, 2024, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with certain lenders, which provides a million secured revolving credit facility ("revolving credit facility"). The revolving credit facility may be made available in U.S. Dollars and certain other currencies and may be increased, and new term loan commitments may be entered into, by up to an additional million if the existing or additional lenders are willing to make such increased commitments. The revolving credit facility has sublimits for swing line loans up to million and for the issuance of standby letters of credit in a face amount up to million. We expect to use the revolving credit facility to fund our proposed acquisition of ShareFile and for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Interest rates for the revolving credit facility are determined by reference to a Term Benchmark Rate or a base rate at our option and would range from to above the Term Benchmark Rate for Term Benchmark-based borrowings or from to above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our consolidated total net leverage ratio. Additionally, we may borrow certain foreign currencies at rates set in the same range above the respective Term Benchmark Rates for those currencies, based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility is required, ranging from to per annum, based upon our consolidated total net leverage ratio. 
 
 The credit facility matures on March 7, 2029. The revolving credit facility does not require amortization of principal. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until the maturity date, at which time all amounts outstanding must be repaid. Accrued interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears. As of August 31, 2024, the revolving credit facility was undrawn. 
 
 Costs incurred to obtain our long-term debt of million, along with million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the previous credit agreement, were recorded as debt issuance costs and will be amortized over the term of the debt agreement using the effective interest method. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the repaid term loan were expensed.

 In 2022, 2023, and 2024, we granted performance-based restricted stock units that include performance metrics under our Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") where the performance measurement period is . Vesting of the LTIP awards in the 2022, 2023, and 2024 plans are based on the following: (i) is based on achievement of a cumulative operating income, and (ii) is based on our level of attainment of specified TSR targets relative to the percentage appreciation of a specified index of companies for the respective periods. The vesting of LTIP awards is also subject to continued employment of the grantees through the performance period, except in the event of a qualifying termination. In order to estimate the fair value of such awards, we use a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation model for the market condition portion of the award, which uses the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, less the present value of expected dividends when applicable, for the portion related to the performance condition.

 Deferred Contract Costs 
 
 Certain of our sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Depending upon the sales incentive program and the related revenue arrangement, such capitalized costs are amortized over the longer of (i) the product life, which is generally three to ; or (ii) the term of the related revenue contract. We determined that a three to product life represents the period of benefit that we receive from these incremental costs based on both qualitative and quantitative factors, which include customer contracts, industry norms, and product upgrades. Total deferred contract costs were million and million as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively, and are included in other current assets and other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of deferred contract costs is included in sales and marketing expense on our condensed consolidated statement of operations and was minimal in all periods presented.

 We excluded stock awards representing approximately and shares of common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share in the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively, as these awards were anti-dilutive. We excluded stock awards representing approximately and shares of common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share in the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, respectively, as these awards were anti-dilutive. 
 
 The dilutive impact of the Notes on our calculation of diluted earnings per share is considered using the if-converted method. However, because the principal amount of the Notes must be settled in cash, the dilutive impact of applying the if-converted method is limited to the in-the-money portion, if any, of the Notes. During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, we did not include the Notes in our diluted earnings per share calculation because the conversion feature in the Notes was out of the money. 
 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2023, the average daily closing price of the Company's common stock was greater than the conversion price for the 2026 Notes outstanding as of August 31, 2023. Therefore, for this period, the Company applied the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per common share. During the nine months ended August 31, 2023, the average daily closing price of the Company's common stock was less than the conversion price for the 2026 Notes. Therefore, for this period, the 2026 Notes had no impact on the computation of diluted earnings per common share.

 MOVEit Vulnerability 
 
 As previously reported, on the evening of May 28, 2023, we learned that our MOVEit Transfer (the on-premise version) and MOVEit Cloud (a cloud-hosted version of MOVEit Transfer) products were attacked via a zero-day vulnerability that could provide for unauthorized escalated privileges and access to the customer s underlying environment (the MOVEit Vulnerability ). A "zero-day vulnerability" is a vulnerability that has been publicly disclosed and/or exploited (e.g., by an independent researcher or threat actor) before the software vendor has an opportunity to patch it. We continue to monitor the impact of the MOVEit Vulnerability on our business, operations, and financial results. MOVEit Transfer and MOVEit Cloud represented less than in aggregate of our revenue for the nine months ended August 31, 2024. 
 
 Litigation and Governmental Investigations Arising from the MOVEit Vulnerability 
 
 As previously reported, as a result of the MOVEit Vulnerability, we are party to certain class action lawsuits filed by individuals who claim to have been impacted by the exfiltration of data from the environments of our MOVEit Transfer customers, which the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred to the District of Massachusetts for coordinated and consolidated proceedings (the "MDL"). The MDL also includes the previously disclosed subrogation claim (where an insurer is seeking recovery for expenses incurred on behalf of its insured in connection with the MOVEit Vulnerability). 
 
 Also as previously disclosed, we have also been cooperating with inquires and investigations from: (i) several domestic and foreign data privacy regulators (a number of which have been closed without regulatory action), (ii) several state attorneys general, and (iii) one formal investigation from a U.S. federal law enforcement agency (as of the date of the filing of the financial statements, this is not an enforcement action or formal governmental investigation of which we have been told that we are a target). 
 
 As previously disclosed, we received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission s Division of Enforcement (the SEC on October 2, 2023, as part of a fact-finding inquiry seeking various documents and information relating to the MOVEit Vulnerability. In a letter dated August 7, 2024, the SEC notified us that the Commission had concluded its investigation and did not intend to recommend an enforcement action against Progress (the Termination Letter ). The Termination Letter was provided under the guidelines set out in the final paragraph of Securities Act Release No. 5310. 
 
 Expenses Incurred and Future Costs 
 
 For the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, we incurred net costs of million and million , respectively, related to the MOVEit Vulnerability. The costs recognized are net of insurance recoveries of million and million for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively. The timing of recognizing insurance recoveries may differ from the timing of recognizing the associated expenses.

million of cybersecurity insurance coverage, which is expected to reduce our exposure to expenses and liabilities arising from these events. As of August 31, 2024, we have recorded approximately million in insurance recoveries, of which million was related to the November 2022 cyber incident and million was related to the May 2023 MOVEit Vulnerability, providing us with approximately million of additional cybersecurity insurance coverage under the applicable policy (which is subject to a million retention per claim). We will pursue recoveries to the maximum extent available under our insurance policies.

 million in cash, subject to a million working capital credit. The closing of the acquisition (the Closing is expected to occur in the quarter ending November 30, 2024. The acquisition is expected to be funded with a combination of existing cash on hand and borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility. The acquisition will add product and service solutions to our capabilities with ShareFile s SaaS-native, AI-powered document-centric collaboration and workflows, client portal, secure file sync and share and eSignature abilities. 
 
 Our Board of Directors has approved the suspension of Progress quarterly dividend in connection with the Closing and plans to redirect such capital toward the repayment of debt to increase liquidity for future M A and for share repurchases.

Overview 
 
 Progress provides enterprise software products for the development, deployment and management of responsible, AI-powered applications and experiences. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results may differ from these estimates. The most significant estimates relate to revenue recognition, loss contingencies and the MOVEit Vulnerability, and business combinations. For further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1: Basis of Presentation to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2023 Annual Report. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Use of Constant Currency 
 
 Revenue from our international operations has historically represented a substantial portion of our total revenue. As a result, our revenue results have been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, if the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries strengthen, our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are positively impacted. 
 
 As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis enhances the understanding of our revenue results and evaluation of our performance in comparison to prior periods. The constant currency information presented is calculated by translating current period results using prior period weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.

 Our effective tax rate was 17 and 9 in the third fiscal quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The primary reason for the increase in the effective rate was due to discrete tax benefits in the third fiscal quarter of 2023 related to stock-based compensation and the impacts of Notice 2023-55, which was issued by the Internal Revenue Service during July 2023 and provided temporary relief for taxpayers in determining whether a foreign tax is eligible for a foreign tax credit under Sections 901 and 903 of the Internal Revenue Code. There were no significant discrete tax items in the third fiscal quarter of 2024.

 Select Performance Metrics: 
 
 Management evaluates our financial performance using a number of financial and operating metrics. These metrics are periodically reviewed and revised to reflect changes in our business. 
 
 Annualized Recurring Revenue ("ARR") 
 
 We disclose ARR as a performance metric to help investors better understand and assess the performance of our business because our mix of revenue generated from recurring sources currently represents the substantial majority of our revenues and is expected to continue in the future. We define ARR as the annualized revenue of all active and contractually binding term-based contracts from all customers at a point in time. ARR includes revenue from maintenance, software upgrade rights, public cloud, and on-premises subscription-based transactions and managed services. ARR mitigates fluctuations in revenue due to seasonality, contract term and the sales mix of subscriptions for term-based licenses and SaaS. Management uses ARR to understand customer trends and the overall health of the Company s business, helping it to formulate strategic business decisions. 
 
 We calculate the annualized value of annual and multi-year contracts, and contracts with terms less than one year, by dividing the total contract value of each contract by the number of months in the term and then multiplying by 12. Annualizing contracts with terms less than one-year results in amounts being included in our ARR that are in excess of the total contract value for those contracts at the end of the reporting period. We generally do not sell contracts with a term of less than one year unless a customer is purchasing additional licenses under an existing annual or multi-year contract. The expectation is that at the time of renewal, contracts with a term less than one year will renew with the same term as the existing contracts being renewed, such that both contracts are co-termed. Historically contracts with a term of less than one year renew at rates equal to or better than annual or multi-year contracts. 
 
 Revenue from term-based license and on-premises subscription arrangements include a portion of the arrangement consideration that is allocated to the software license that is recognized up-front at the point in time control is transferred under ASC 606 revenue recognition principles. ARR for these arrangements is calculated as described above. The expectation is that the total contract value, inclusive of revenue recognized as software license, will be renewed at the end of the contract term. 
 
 The calculation is done at constant currency using the current year budgeted exchange rates for all periods presented. 
 
 ARR is not defined in GAAP and is not derived from a GAAP measure. Rather, ARR generally aligns to billings (as opposed to GAAP revenue which aligns to the transfer of control of each performance obligation). ARR does not have any standardized meaning and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those 
 31 

items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers. 
 
 Our ARR was 582.0 million and 581.0 million as of August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively, which is relatively flat year-over-year. 
 
 Net Retention Rate 
 
 We calculate net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from the cohort of all customers as of 12 months prior to such period end ("Prior Period ARR"). We then calculate the ARR from these same customers as of the current period end ("Current Period ARR"). Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the net retention rate. Net retention rate is not defined in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Our net retention rates have generally ranged between 99 and 101 for all periods presented. Our high net retention rates illustrate our predictable and durable top line performance. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 (in thousands) August 31, 2024 November 30, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 232,713 126,958 
 
 The increase in cash and cash equivalents of 105.8 million from the end of fiscal year 2023 was due to proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes of 396.5 million (net of purchases of capped calls in connection with the convertible notes offering of 42.2 million and issuance costs of 11.2 million), cash inflows from operations of 191.8 million, 6.8 million in cash received from the issuance of common stock, and the effect of exchange rates on cash of 1.5 million. We refinanced our debt by issuing the convertible senior notes and used the proceeds to pay off the outstanding balance of the term loan and revolving line of credit under our previous credit agreement. As such, the cash inflows described above were offset by cash outflows of 261.3 million to pay off the balance of the term loan, 110.0 million to pay off the revolving line of credit, repurchases of common stock of 86.8 million, dividend payments of 23.8 million, payment of debt issuance costs of 6.8 million, and purchases of property and equipment of 2.3 million. Except as described below, there are no limitations on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 As of August 31, 2024, 77.2 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Foreign cash includes unremitted foreign earnings, which are invested indefinitely outside of the U.S. As such, the foreign cash is not available to fund our domestic operations. If we were to repatriate these earnings, we may be subject to income tax withholding in certain tax jurisdictions and a portion of the repatriated earnings may be subject to U.S. income tax. However, we do not anticipate that this would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 In January 2023, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by 150 million, to an aggregate authorization of 228.0 million. In the three months ended August 31, 2024, we repurchased and retired 0.3 million shares for 14.3 million. In the three months ended August 31, 2023, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. In the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, we repurchased and retired 1.6 million shares for 86.8 million and 0.5 million shares for 30.0 million, respectively. The shares were repurchased in both periods as part of our Board of Directors authorized share repurchase program. As of August 31, 2024, there was 107.2 million remaining under the current authorization. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 As announced on September 9, 2024, Progress Board of Directors approved the suspension of Progress quarterly dividend in connection with the ShareFile acquisition and plans to redirect such capital toward the repayment of debt to increase liquidity for future M A and for share repurchases, both of which are prioritized in our capital allocation policy.

 Cash Flows From Operating Activities 
 
 Nine Months Ended (in thousands) August 31, 2024 August 31, 2023 Net income 67,291 54,862 Non-cash reconciling items included in net income 107,579 96,452 Changes in operating assets and liabilities 16,973 (10,555) Net cash flows from operating activities 191,843 140,759 
 
 In the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, operating cash flows increased due to higher billings and collections, and lower interest rates as a result of our debt refinancing in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our gross accounts receivable as of August 31, 2024, decreased by 38.2 million from the end of fiscal year 2023. Our days sales outstanding (DSO) in accounts receivable decreased to 45 days in the third fiscal quarter of 2024 from 49 days in the third fiscal quarter of 2023 due to the timing of billings and collections. 
 
 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
 
 Nine Months Ended (in thousands) August 31, 2024 August 31, 2023 Net investment activity 438 Purchases of property and equipment (2,328) (3,181) Payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired (355,250) Net cash flows used in investing activities (2,328) (357,993) 
 
 Net cash outflows and inflows of our net investment activity are generally a result of the timing of our purchases and maturities of securities, which are classified as cash equivalents or short-term securities. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, we purchased 2.3 million of property and equipment. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 we also had payments for acquisitions net of cash acquired of 355.3 million, and 3.2 million of purchases of property and equipment. 
 
 33 

Cash Flows (Used in) From Financing Activities 
 
 Nine Months Ended (in thousands) August 31, 2024 August 31, 2023 Proceeds from stock-based compensation plans 17,474 20,373 Repurchases of common stock (86,777) (30,000) Proceeds from issuance of senior convertible notes, net of issuance costs of 11,200 438,750 Purchase of capped calls (42,210) Proceeds from the issuance of debt 195,000 Repayment of revolving line of credit (110,000) (55,000) Principal payment on term loan (261,250) (5,157) Dividend payments to stockholders (23,814) (23,669) Other financing activities (10,627) (8,101) Payment of credit facility debt issuance costs (6,821) Net cash flows (used in) from financing activities (85,275) 93,446 
 
 Our financing activities are significantly impacted by non-recurring financing transactions, including those detailed above and as explained in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Further, we repurchased 86.8 million of our common stock under our share repurchase plan compared to 30.0 million in the same period of the prior year. Finally, we made dividend payments of 23.8 million to our stockholders during the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 and 23.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. As noted above, the Board of Directors has announced a suspension of future dividends. 
 
 Liquidity Outlook 
 
 Cash from operations in fiscal year 2024 could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of various risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report, including increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets that could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. However, based on our current business plan, we believe that existing cash balances, together with funds generated from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements through at least the next twelve months, including funding our proposed acquisition of ShareFile with a combination of existing cash on hand and borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility. We do not contemplate a need for any foreign repatriation of the earnings which are deemed invested indefinitely outside of the U.S. Our foreseeable cash needs include capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt repayments, share repurchases, lease commitments, restructuring obligations and other long-term obligations. 

Legal and Other Regulatory Matters 
 
 MOVEit Vulnerability 
 
 As previously reported, on the evening of May 28, 2023, we learned that our MOVEit Transfer (the on-premise version) and MOVEit Cloud (a cloud-hosted version of MOVEit Transfer) products were attacked via a zero-day vulnerability that could provide for unauthorized escalated privileges and access to the customer s underlying environment (the MOVEit Vulnerability ). A "zero-day vulnerability" is a vulnerability that has been publicly disclosed and/or exploited (e.g., by an independent researcher or threat actor) before the software vendor has an opportunity to patch it. We continue to monitor the impact of the MOVEit Vulnerability on our business, operations, and financial results. MOVEit Transfer and MOVEit Cloud represented less than 4 in aggregate of our revenue for the nine months ended August 31, 2024. 
 
 We are subject to litigation and governmental investigations related to the MOVEit Vulnerability, for which we have incurred expenses and will incur future costs. We expect our exposure to such expenses and liabilities to be reduced by insurance. 
 Please refer to Note 15: Cyber Related Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1, Financial Statements for additional details and updates regarding the MOVEit Vulnerability.

 Our management maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods and that such information was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
