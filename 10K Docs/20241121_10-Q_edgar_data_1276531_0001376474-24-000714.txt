 Company Overview 
 
 Scientific Energy, Inc, (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Utah on May 30, 2001. It is not a Chinese operating company, but a Utah holding company with business operations primarily conducted through its majority-owned direct operating subsidiary, Macao E-Media Development Company Limited, a company incorporated in Macau MEMD ). We also have several direct or indirect subsidiaries incorporated in Macau, Hong Kong and the mainland China that provide back-office and technical support to our main business operations in Macau. Substantially all of our assets are located in Macau and substantially all of our revenue are derived from Macau. We do not conduct any operations in, nor do we rely on counterparties that operate in, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. 
 
 Our principal executive offices are located in Macau. We do not have, nor do we intend to have, any contractual arrangement to establish a variable interest entity VIE structure with any entity in Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China. 
 
 As a holding company, we have no operation of our own. Our investors hold shares of common stock in Scientific Energy, Inc. the Utah holding company. Due to the significant influence of the Chinese government on Hong Kong and Macau, as a China-based company, our business operations are also affected by the Chinese government. Below are some risk factors relating to doing business in China. 
 
 The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB had historically been unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections over our auditor has deprived our investors of the benefits of such inspections. 
 
 Our auditor, the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report in our SEC filings, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. Our auditor is located in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC ("Hong Kong"), China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB was unable to conduct inspections and investigations before 2022. As a result, we and investors in our securities were deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong in 2022. However, the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in Hong Kong in the past made it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting firm s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China mainland and Hong Kong that have been subject to the PCAOB inspections, which could cause investors and potential investors in our securities to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements. 
 
 Our common stock may be delisted and prohibited from trading in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, as amended by Consolidated Appropriations Act 2023, and related regulations, if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely auditors located in mainland China and Hong Kong. The delisting of our common stock or the threat of their being delisted could cause the value of our common stock to significantly decline or be worthless, and thus you could lose all or substantial portion of your investment. 
 
 Pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2023, (the "HFCAA"), if the SEC determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspections by the PCAOB for two consecutive years, the SEC will prohibit our shares from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report to notify the SEC of its determination that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including our auditor. On May 13, 2022, the SEC conclusively listed us as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA following the filing of the annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB issued a report that vacated its December 16, 2021 determination and removed mainland China and Hong Kong from the list of jurisdictions where it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms. For this reason, we do not expect to be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA after we file the annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Each year, the PCAOB will determine whether it can inspect and investigate completely audit firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, among other jurisdictions. If PCAOB determines in the future that it no longer has full access to inspect and investigate completely accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong and we continue to use an accounting firm headquartered in Hong Kong to issue an audit report on our financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we would be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer following the filing of the annual report on Form 10-K for the relevant fiscal year. There can be no assurance that we would not be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for any future fiscal year, and if we were so identified for two consecutive years, we would become subject to the prohibition on trading under the HFCAA and our securities may be delisted from OTC Markets as a result. Delisting of our securities would force holders of our securities to sell their securities. Further, we may be prohibited from listing our securities on another U.S. securities exchange. The market price of our securities could be adversely affected as a result of anticipated negative impacts of such legislative or executive actions upon, as well as negative investor sentiment toward, companies with significant operations in mainland China and Macau/Hong Kong that are listed in the United States, regardless of whether such actions are implemented and regardless of our actual operating performance. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related To Doing Business In China- The PCAOB had historically been unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of our auditor in the past has deprived our investors of the benefits of such inspections" and Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related To Doing Business In China - Our common stock may be prohibited from trading in the United States under the HFCAA in the future if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely auditors located in China. The delisting of our common stock, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment." 
 
 Corporate Structure 
 
 Our corporate organizational chart, as of September 30, 2024, is as follows: 

Our holding company structure presents unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our operating subsidiaries and will be dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to finance our cash flow needs. Our ability to receive dividends and other contributions from our subsidiaries are significantly affected by regulations promulgated by Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China authorities. Any change in the interpretation of existing rules and regulations or the promulgation of new rules and regulations may materially affect our operations and/or the value of our securities, including causing the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company associated with our structure, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors disclosed in Form 10-K/A (Amendment No. 2) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 
 
 There was no Chinese Communist Party official who sits on the board of the Company and that the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not contain any charter of the Chinese Communist Party.

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

on . Prior to August 2011, the Company was principally devoted to the buying and selling of various types and grades of graphite, such as medium and high-carbon graphite, high-purity graphite, micro-powder graphite and expandable graphite. In August 2011, the Company decided to engage in a business of e-commerce platform. Currently the Company is in the process of developing a website, which provides an e-commerce platform, where registered members can exchange goods and services. 
 
 On March 28, 2006, the Company set up a wholly owned subsidiary, PDI Global Limited PDI ), which was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands in order to engage in a business of e-commerce platform. 
 
 In January 2008, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with China Resources Development Group Ltd., a Hong Kong company. Under the agreement, a joint venture company, Kabond Investments Ltd (the JVC ), was established in Hong Kong, and the Company invested 39.6 million Hong Kong dollars (approximately 5.09 million) into the JVC for 72 of the JVC s capital shares, and China Resources Development Group Ltd., jointly with its partner, invested 15.4 million Hong Kong dollars (approximately 1.98 million) into the JVC to receive 28 of the JVC s capital shares.

As a result of this acquisition, MED becomes a 98.75 owned subsidiary of the Company. MED was founded at Macao in 2011. Its main area of business includes food and grocery order-pickup-delivery services from local restaurants, supermarkets and hotels. 
 
 MED has five subsidiaries, each of which is in charge of respective area such as Development Maintenance, Marketing Operation, Logistics Delivery, Payment Clearance, Emerging Market Business Development.

The Company evaluates the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The carrying value of an item of property, plant and equipment is considered impaired when the projected undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than its carrying value. The Company measures impairment based on the amount by which the carrying value of the respective asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined primarily using the projected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.

The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

as of September 30, 2024. The Company also experienced insufficient cash flows from operations and will be required continuous financial support from the shareholders. The Company will need to raise capital to fund its operations until it is able to generate sufficient revenue to support the future development. Moreover, the Company may be continuously raising capital through the sale of debt and equity securities. 
 
 The Company s ability to achieve these objectives cannot be determined at this stage. If the Company is unsuccessful in its endeavors, it may be forced to cease operations. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty which may include adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 These factors have raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain adequate financing or achieve profitability. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Balance at end of period 

Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to the acquisition of the shares of Macao E-Media Development Company Limited including its subsidiaries Fresh Life Technology Company Limited and Citysearch Technology (HK) Company Limited by the Company. 
 
 The Company performed goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the asset might be impaired. As of December 31, 2023, the Company performed testing on reporting unit. 
 
 The Company first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. For those reporting units where it is determined that it is more likely than not that their fair values are less than the units carrying amounts, the Company will perform the first step of a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. After performing the assessment, if the carrying amounts of the reporting units are higher than their fair values, the Company will perform the second step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. 
 
 For the two-step goodwill impairment test, the Company estimated the fair value with income approach for specific reporting unit component. With the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on the best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected expansion, pricing, market share, and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.
