 natural gas liquefaction and export facilities located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana at Sabine Pass and near Corpus Christi, Texas (respectively, the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal and Corpus Christi LNG Terminal ). 
 
 CQP owns the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal, which has natural gas liquefaction facilities consisting of operational Trains, for a total production capacity of approximately mtpa of LNG (the SPL Project ). The Sabine Pass LNG Terminal also has operational regasification facilities that include LNG storage tanks, vaporizers and marine berths. We also own and operate a -mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal with several large interstate and intrastate pipelines (the Creole Trail Pipeline ). As of September 30, 2024, we owned of the general partner interest, a limited partner interest and of the incentive distribution rights of CQP. 
 
 The Corpus Christi LNG Terminal currently has operational Trains for a total production capacity of approximately mtpa of LNG, LNG storage tanks and marine berths. Additionally, we are constructing an expansion of the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal (the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project consisting of midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of over mtpa of LNG. We also own a -mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal with several large interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines (the Corpus Christi Pipeline and together with the existing assets at the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal and the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project, the CCL Project ). 
 
 We are pursuing expansion projects to provide additional liquefaction capacity at the SPL Project and the CCL Project (collectively, the Liquefaction Projects ), and we have commenced commercialization to support the additional liquefaction capacity associated with these potential expansion projects. The development of these sites or other projects, including infrastructure projects in support of natural gas supply and LNG demand, will require, among other things, acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before we make a positive FID.

 We value the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives and LNG Trading Derivatives using a market or option-based approach incorporating present value techniques, as needed, which incorporates observable commodity price curves, when available, and other relevant data. We value our FX Derivatives with a market approach using observable FX rates and other relevant data. 
 
 We include a significant portion of the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy as the fair value is developed through the use of internal models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants may use in valuing the asset or liability. To the extent valued using an option pricing model, we consider the future prices of energy units for unobservable periods to be a significant unobservable input to estimated net fair value. In estimating the future prices of energy units, we make judgments about market risk related to liquidity of commodity indices and volatility utilizing available market data. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments. We derive our volatility assumptions based on observed historical settled global LNG market pricing or accepted proxies for global LNG market pricing as well as settled domestic natural gas pricing. Such volatility assumptions also contemplate, as of the balance sheet date, observable forward curve data of such indices, as well as evolving available industry data and independent studies. 
 
 In developing our volatility assumptions, we acknowledge that the global LNG industry is inherently influenced by events such as unplanned supply constraints, geopolitical incidents, unusual climate events including drought and uncommonly mild, by historical standards, winters and summers, and real or threatened disruptive operational impacts to global energy

 Commodity Derivatives 
 
 We hold Liquefaction Supply Derivatives which are primarily indexed to the natural gas market and international LNG indices. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining fixed terms of the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives ranged up to approximately years, some of which commence or accelerate upon the satisfaction of certain events or development of infrastructure to support natural gas gathering and transport. 
 
 Cheniere Marketing has historically entered into, and may from time to time enter into, LNG transactions that provide for contractual net settlement. Such transactions are accounted for as LNG Trading Derivatives along with financial commodity contracts in the form of swaps or futures. The terms of LNG Trading Derivatives range up to approximately .

 FX Derivatives 
 
 Cheniere Marketing holds FX Derivatives to protect against the volatility in future cash flows attributable to changes in international currency exchange rates. The FX Derivatives are executed primarily to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure arising from cash flows expended for both physical and financial LNG transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. The terms of FX Derivatives range up to approximately . 
 The total notional amount of our FX Derivatives was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Fair Value and Location of Derivative Assets and Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets 
 
 All existing counterparty derivative contracts provide for the unconditional right of set-off in the event of default. We have elected to report derivative assets and liabilities arising from those derivative contracts with the same counterparty and the unconditional contractual right of set-off on a net basis. The use of derivative instruments exposes us to counterparty credit risk, or the risk that a counterparty will be unable to meet its commitments, in instances when our derivative instruments are in an asset position. Additionally, counterparties are at risk that we will be unable to meet our commitments in instances where our derivative instruments are in a liability position. We incorporate both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in fair value measurements depending on the position of the derivative. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, set-off rights and guarantees.

 The following potential future sources of revenue are omitted from the table above under exemptions we have elected: (1) all performance obligations that are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less and (2) substantially all variable consideration under our SPAs and TUAs as well as variable consideration that is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation when that performance obligation qualifies as a series. The amount of revenue from variable fees that is not included in the transaction price will vary based on the future prices of the underlying variable index, primarily Henry Hub, throughout the contract terms, to the extent customers elect to take delivery of their LNG, and adjustments to the consumer price index. Certain of our contracts contain additional variable consideration based on the outcome of contingent events and the movement of various indexes. We have not included such variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent the consideration is considered constrained due to the uncertainty of ultimate pricing and receipt. Additionally, we have excluded variable consideration related to volumes that are contractually subject to additional liquefaction capacity beyond what is currently in construction or operation.

Overview 
 
 Cheniere, a Delaware corporation, is a Houston-based energy infrastructure company primarily engaged in LNG-related businesses. We provide clean, secure and affordable LNG to integrated energy companies, utilities and energy trading companies around the world. We aspire to conduct our business in a safe and responsible manner, delivering a reliable, competitive and integrated source of LNG to our customers. 
 
 LNG is natural gas (methane) in liquid form. The LNG we produce is shipped all over the world, converted back into natural gas (called regasification and then transported via pipeline to homes and businesses and used as an energy source that is essential for heating, cooking, other industrial uses and back up for intermittent energy sources. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning, abundant and affordable source of energy. When LNG is converted back to natural gas, it can be used instead of coal, which reduces the amount of pollution traditionally produced from burning fossil fuels, like sulfur dioxide and particulate matter that enters the air we breathe. Additionally, compared to coal, it produces significantly fewer carbon emissions. By liquefying natural gas, we are able to reduce its volume by 600 times so that we can load it onto special LNG carriers designed to keep the LNG cold and in liquid form for efficient transport overseas. 
 
 We are the largest producer of LNG in the United States and we are the second largest LNG operator globally, based on the total production capacity of our liquefaction facilities, which totaled approximately 45 mtpa as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We own and operate a natural gas liquefaction and export facility located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana at Sabine Pass (the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal ), one of the largest LNG production facilities in the world, through our ownership interest in and management agreements with CQP, which is a publicly traded limited partnership that we formed in 2007. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 100 of the general partner interest, a 48.6 limited partner interest and 100 of the incentive distribution rights of CQP. The Sabine Pass LNG Terminal has six operational Trains, for a total production capacity of approximately 30 mtpa of LNG (the SPL Project ). The Sabine Pass LNG Terminal also has operational regasification facilities that include five LNG storage tanks with aggregate capacity of approximately 17 Bcfe and vaporizers with regasification capacity of approximately 4 Bcf/d, as well as three marine berths, two of which can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters and the third berth which can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 up to 200,000 cubic meters. We also own and operate a 94-mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal with several large interstate and intrastate pipelines (the Creole Trail Pipeline ). 
 Additionally, we own and operate a natural gas liquefaction and export facility located near Corpus Christi, Texas (the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal through CCL, which currently has natural gas liquefaction facilities consisting of three operational Trains for a total production capacity of approximately 15 mtpa of LNG, three LNG storage tanks with aggregate capacity of approximately 10 Bcfe and two marine berths that can each accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters. We are constructing an expansion of the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal (the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project consisting of seven midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of over 10 mtpa of LNG. We also own and operate a 21.5-mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal with several large interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines (the Corpus Christi Pipeline and together with the existing assets at the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal and the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project, the CCL Project ). 
 
 Our long-term customer arrangements form the foundation of our business and provide us with significant, stable, long-term cash flows. We have contracted substantially all of our anticipated production capacity under SPAs, in which our customers are generally required to pay a fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes irrespective of their election to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, and under IPM agreements, in which a gas producer sells natural gas to us on a global LNG or natural gas index price, less a fixed liquefaction fee, shipping and other costs. The SPAs also have a variable fee component, which is generally structured to cover the cost of natural gas purchases, transportation and liquefaction fuel consumed to produce LNG. Since we procure most of our feedstock for LNG production from the U.S., the structure of these contracts helps limit our exposure to fluctuations in U.S. natural gas prices. Through our SPAs and IPM agreements, we have contracted approximately 95 of the total anticipated production from the SPL Project and the CCL Project (collectively, the Liquefaction Projects through the mid-2030s with approximately 16 years of weighted average remaining life as of September 30, 2024, excluding volumes from contracts with terms less than 10 years and volumes that are contractually subject to additional liquefaction capacity beyond what is currently in construction or operation. We also market and sell LNG produced by the Liquefaction Projects that is not contracted by CCL or SPL through our integrated marketing function. 
 
 We remain focused on safety, operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Increasing demand for LNG has allowed us to expand our liquefaction infrastructure in a financially disciplined manner. We have increased available liquefaction capacity at our Liquefaction Projects as a result of debottlenecking and other optimization projects. We believe these factors provide a foundation for additional growth in our portfolio of customer contracts in the future. We hold significant land positions at both the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal and the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal, which provide opportunity for further liquefaction capacity expansion. In March 2023, certain of our subsidiaries submitted an application with the FERC under the Natural Gas Act (the NGA for an expansion adjacent to the CCL Project consisting of two midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of approximately 3 mtpa of LNG (the CCL Midscale Trains 8 9 Project ). Additionally, we are developing an expansion adjacent to the SPL Project with a total production capacity of up to approximately 20 mtpa of LNG, inclusive of estimated debottlenecking opportunities (the SPL Expansion Project ). In February 2024, certain subsidiaries of CQP submitted an application to the FERC under the NGA for authorization to site, construct and operate the SPL Expansion Project, as well as an application to the DOE requesting authorization to export LNG to FTA countries and non-FTA countries, both of which applications exclude debottlenecking. The development of the CCL Midscale Trains 8 9 Project, the SPL Expansion Project or other projects, including infrastructure projects in support of natural gas supply and LNG demand, will require, among other things, acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before we make a positive FID. 
 
 Additionally, we are committed to the management of our most important ESG impacts, risks and opportunities. In August 2024, we published Energy Secured, Benefits Delivered , our fifth Corporate Responsibility CR report, which details our approach and progress on ESG matters. Our CR report is available at cheniere.com/our-responsibility/reporting-center. Information on our website, including the CR report, is not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Overview of Significant Events 
 
 Our significant events since January 1, 2024 and through the filing date of this Form 10-Q include the following: 
 
 Strategic 
 
 In July 2024, Cheniere Marketing entered into a long-term SPA with Galp Trading S.A. Galp ), a subsidiary of Galp Energia, SGPS, S.A., under which Galp has agreed to purchase approximately 0.5 mtpa of LNG from Cheniere Marketing on a free-on-board basis for a term of 20 years. Deliveries are expected to commence in the early 2030s and are subject to, among other things, a positive FID with respect to the second train of the SPL Expansion Project SPL Train 8 and includes a limited number of early cargoes to be purchased by Galp prior to the start of SPL Train 8. 
 In June 2024, we received a positive Environmental Assessment from the FERC relating to the CCL Midscale Trains 8 9 Project. We expect to receive all remaining necessary regulatory approvals for the project in 2025. 
 In February 2024, certain subsidiaries of CQP submitted an application to the FERC under the NGA for authorization to site, construct and operate the SPL Expansion Project, as well as an application to the DOE requesting authorization to export LNG to FTA countries and non-FTA countries, both of which applications exclude debottlenecking. In October 2024, the authorization from the DOE to export LNG to FTA countries was received. 
 
 Operational 
 
 As of October 25, 2024, approximately 3,720 cumulative LNG cargoes totaling over 255 million tonnes of LNG have been produced, loaded and exported from the Liquefaction Projects. 
 
 Financial 
 
 In June 2024, we announced updates to our 20/20 Vision comprehensive long-term capital allocation plan, which included an increase to our share repurchase authorization by 4 billion through 2027 and a plan to increase our quarterly dividend by approximately 15 to 2.00 per common share annualized, which commenced with the dividend pertaining to the third quarter of 2024.

 Net income attributable to Cheniere 
 
 Net income attributable to Cheniere declined 808 million and 6.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023. The decline between the respective three and nine month periods was primarily attributable to unfavorable changes in fair value of derivatives of 923 million and 6.1 billion (before tax and the impact of non-controlling interest), respectively, principally attributable to our IPM agreements, where the associated gains decreased mainly due to the impact on fair value from the nonrecurrence of significant declines of historic volatility in international gas prices and moderated and sustained spot prices in the current periods relative to the same periods of 2023. The remaining changes in fair value of derivatives were primarily due to an unfavorable shift in long-term U.S. natural gas forward prices. In addition, there was a 159 million and 2.7 billion decrease in LNG revenues, net of cost of sales and excluding the effect of derivatives, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, the majority of which was attributable to a reduction of volumes sold under short-term agreements as a higher proportion of our LNG was sold under long-term contracts, as further described in Revenues below. 
 These unfavorable variances were partially offset by: 
 209 million and 1.6 billion favorable variances in income tax provision between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, primarily due to lower taxable earnings; and

 76 million and 796 million reduction in net income attributable to non-controlling interest between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, substantially all of which is due to a decrease in CQP s consolidated net income between the comparable periods from declining gains related to changes in fair value of derivatives between the three and nine month periods. 
 
 The following is an additional discussion of the significant drivers of the variance in net income attributable to common stockholders by line item: 
 
 Revenues 
 
 The decreases of 396 million and 4.3 billion between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023 were primarily attributable to: 
 314 million and 3.6 billion decreases in revenues generated by our marketing function under short-term agreements between the three and nine month periods, respectively, due to declining international LNG and gas prices and a reduction of volumes sold under short-term agreements as a result of additional long-term agreements commencing after the third quarter of 2023; and 
 25 million and 719 million decreases in revenues attributable to declining Henry Hub pricing, to which the majority of our long-term LNG sales contracts are indexed, between the three and nine month periods, respectively. 
 
 Operating costs and expenses (recoveries) 
 
 There was a 712 million unfavorable variance between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily as a result of a 915 million unfavorable variance from changes in fair value of derivatives included in cost of sales, as described above under the caption Net income attributable to Cheniere , partially offset by a 203 million decrease in cost of natural gas feedstock largely due to lower U.S. natural gas prices. 
 
 There was a 4.4 billion unfavorable variance between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily attributable to a 6.1 billion unfavorable variance from changes in fair value of derivatives included in cost of sales, as described above under the caption Net income attributable to Cheniere. This unfavorable variance was partially offset by a 1.6 billion decrease between the periods in cost of sales excluding the effect of derivative changes described above, primarily as a result of a 1.5 billion decrease in cost of natural gas feedstock largely due to lower U.S. natural gas prices. 
 
 Other income (expense) 
 
 The 15 million and 71 million favorable variances between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023 were primarily attributable to: 
 36 million and 101 million decreases in interest expense, net of capitalized interest, between the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily due to 24 million and 69 million increases, respectively, in interest costs qualifying for capitalization, given the higher carrying value of assets under construction, and additionally due to lower overall interest cost due to debt reduction activities associated with our long-term capital allocation plan; 
 These favorable variances were partially offset by: 
 24 million increase in losses on modification or extinguishment of debt between the nine month periods from debt reduction activities, as further detailed under Financing Cash Flows in Sources and Uses of Cash within Liquidity and Capital Resources; and 
 17 million decrease in interest and dividend income between the three month periods, primarily as a result of lower average cash and cash equivalents balances between the respective periods. 
 Income tax provision 
 
 The 209 million and 1.6 billion favorable variances between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, were primarily attributable to 1.1 billion and 8.6 billion decreases in pre-tax income, respectively, and, to a lesser extent, a lower effective tax rate between the periods. 
 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 Our effective tax rate was 16.1 and 14.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 17.4 and 17.2 for the same periods of 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate decreased between both comparable periods because a larger percentage of pre-tax income was attributable to CQP s income that is not taxable to us. The effective tax rate for the periods was lower than the statutory rate of 21.0 primarily due to CQP s income that is not taxable to us. 
 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 
 
 The 76 million and 796 million decreases between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023 were attributable to 156 million and 1.5 billion decreases in CQP s consolidated net income between the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily from unfavorable changes in fair value of derivatives related to its IPM agreement of 185 million and 1.2 billion, respectively. 
 
 Significant factor affecting our results of operations 
 
 Below is a significant factor that affects our results of operations. 
 
 Gains and losses on derivative instruments 
 
 Derivative instruments, which in addition to managing exposure to commodity-related marketing and price risks are utilized to manage exposure to foreign exchange volatility, are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For commodity derivative instruments related to our IPM agreements, the underlying LNG sales being economically hedged are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting, whereby revenues expected to be derived from the future LNG sales are recognized only upon delivery or realization of the underlying transaction. Notwithstanding the operational intent to mitigate risk exposure over time, the recognition of derivative instruments at fair value has the effect of recognizing gains or losses relating to future period exposure, and given the significant volumes, long-term duration and volatility in price basis for certain of our derivative contracts, the use of derivative instruments may result in continued volatility of our results of operations based on changes in market pricing, counterparty credit risk and other relevant factors that may be outside of our control. For example, as described in Note 5 Derivative Instruments of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the fair value of the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives incorporates, as applicable, market participant-based assumptions pertaining to certain contractual uncertainties, including those related to the availability of market information for delivery points, which may require future development of infrastructure, as well as the timing of satisfaction of certain events or development of infrastructure to support natural gas gathering and transport. We may recognize changes in fair value through earnings that could significantly impact our results of operations if and when such uncertainties are resolved.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The following information describes our ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet our requirements in the short term and the long term. In the short term, we expect to meet our cash requirements using operating cash flows and available liquidity, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and available commitments under our credit facilities. Additionally, we expect to meet our long term cash requirements by using operating cash flows and other future potential sources of liquidity, which may include debt and equity offerings by us or our subsidiaries. The table below provides a summary of our available liquidity (in millions). Future material sources of liquidity are discussed below. 
 September 30, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents (1) 2,663 Restricted cash and cash equivalents (1) 413 Available commitments under our credit facilities (2): SPL Revolving Credit Facility 
 766 CQP Revolving Credit Facility 
 1,000 CCH Credit Facility 
 3,260 CCH Working Capital Facility 
 1,390 Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility 1,250 Total available commitments under our credit facilities 7,666 Total available liquidity 10,742 
 
 (1) Amounts presented include balances held by our consolidated variable interest entities VIEs ), as discussed in Note 6 Non-controlling Interests and Variable Interest Entities of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2024, assets of our VIEs, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, included 331 million of cash and cash equivalents and 103 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. 
 (2) Available commitments represent total commitments less loans outstanding and letters of credit issued under each of our credit facilities as of September 30, 2024. See Note 8 Debt of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our credit facilities and other debt instruments. 
 Our liquidity position subsequent to September 30, 2024 will be driven by future sources of liquidity and future cash requirements. For a discussion of our future sources and uses of liquidity, see the liquidity and capital resources disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Although our sources and uses of cash are presented below from a consolidated standpoint, SPL, CQP, CCH and Cheniere operate with independent capital structures. Certain restrictions or requirements under debt and equity instruments executed by our subsidiaries limit the entity s use of cash, including the following: 
 SPL and CCH are required to deposit all cash received into restricted cash and cash equivalents accounts under certain of their debt agreements. The usage or withdrawal of such cash is restricted to the payment of liabilities related to the Liquefaction Projects and other restricted payments. In addition, SPL and CCH s operating costs are managed by our subsidiaries under affiliate agreements, which may require SPL and CCH to advance cash to the respective affiliates, however the cash remains restricted for operation and construction of the Liquefaction Projects; 
 CQP is required under its partnership agreement to distribute to unitholders all available cash on hand at the end of a quarter less the amount of any reserves established by its general partner. Beginning with the distribution paid in the second quarter of 2022, quarterly distributions by CQP are currently comprised of a base amount plus a variable amount equal to the remaining available cash per unit, which takes into consideration, among other things, amounts reserved for annual debt repayment and capital allocation goals, anticipated capital expenditures to be funded with cash, and cash reserves to provide for the proper conduct of CQP s business; 
 Our 48.6 limited partner interest, 100 general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in CQP limit our right to receive cash held by CQP to the amounts specified by the provisions of CQP s partnership agreement; and 
 SPL and CCH are restricted by affirmative and negative covenants included in certain of their debt agreements in their ability to make certain payments, including distributions, unless specific requirements are satisfied.

Table of Contents 

 Despite the restrictions noted above, we believe that sufficient flexibility exists within the Cheniere complex to enable each independent capital structure to meet its currently anticipated cash requirements. The sources of liquidity at SPL, CQP and CCH primarily fund the cash requirements of the respective entity, and any remaining liquidity not subject to restriction, as supplemented by liquidity provided by Cheniere Marketing, is available to enable Cheniere to meet its cash requirements. 
 
 Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project 
 
 The following table summarizes the project completion and construction status of the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project as of September 30, 2024: 
 Overall project completion percentage 67.8 Completion percentage of: Engineering 95.7 Procurement 85.2 Subcontract work 87.2 Construction 32.0 Date of expected substantial completion 1H 2025 - 2H 2026 

Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 The following table summarizes the sources and uses of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions). The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures, including accruals, which are referred to elsewhere in this report. Additional discussion of these items follows the table. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 3,753 6,698 Net cash used in investing activities (1,706) (1,478) Net cash used in financing activities (3,493) (3,426) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents (3) 2 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents 
 (1,449) 1,796 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 
 The 2.9 billion decrease between the periods was primarily related to lower cash receipts from the sale of LNG cargoes due to a reduction in both pricing per MMBtu and volumes sold under short-term agreements, although this exposed us less to declining international LNG and gas prices in the current year as a higher proportion of our LNG was sold under long-term agreements. The decrease was partially offset by lower cash outflows for natural gas feedstock, mostly due to lower U.S. natural gas prices. 
 
 We became subject to the 15 CAMT beginning in 2024 and expect to owe CAMT in excess of our regular tax liability. During 2024, the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS issued a series of notices that extended the due date of our second, third and fourth estimated tax payments of our regular tax and CAMT liability from 2024 to February 3, 2025 and April 15, 2025, respectively. On September 12, 2024, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the IRS released proposed regulations relating to the application and implementation of the CAMT. For a discussion of the CAMT as originally enacted, including its potential impacts to our liquidity position, see the risk factors and liquidity and capital resource disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 202 3 . Although not required, the proposed regulations permit early adoption and taxpayers can generally choose to rely on the proposed regulations, either fully or partially in some cases, for tax years ending before, on or after September 13, 2024, if consistently applied. The proposed regulations address a wide range of topics relating to the operation of CAMT; however, significant uncertainty continues to exist regarding many of the operative implementing provisions. Importantly, however, the rules clarify that unrealized derivative gains and losses arising from ordinary course transactions aimed at managing price, interest or currency risk should generally be excluded from the CAMT base until realized. Thus, although the proposed regulations are a potentially favorable development that has the potential to mitigate cash tax volatility attributable to changes in fair value of our derivative instruments in the future, our assessment of the 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 proposed CAMT rules across our portfolio of derivative instruments is ongoing and we continue to evaluate its impact to us, including the three transition-year methods discussed in the preamble to the proposed rules which are under consideration for adoption and which could cause our CAMT liability to significantly increase depending on ultimate adoption in the final regulations. 
 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 
 Our investing net cash outflows in both periods primarily were for the construction costs for the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project, which were 1.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.0 billion in the comparable period of 2023, as well as for optimization and other site improvement projects. We expect to incur a proportional level of capital expenditures for the remainder of the year as construction work progresses on the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project.
