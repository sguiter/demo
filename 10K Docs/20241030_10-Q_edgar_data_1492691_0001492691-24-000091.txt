 tractors (comprised of company tractors and independent contractor tractors) and trailers within the Truckload segment and leasing activities within the All Other Segments. The LTL segment operated an average of tractors and trailers. Additionally, the Intermodal segment operated an average of tractors and intermodal containers. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's reportable segments were Truckload, LTL, Logistics, and Intermodal. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in this Quarterly Report include the accounts of Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in Knight-Swift's 2023 Annual Report. 
 With respect to transactional/durational data, references to years pertain to calendar years. Similarly, references to quarters pertain to calendar quarters. 
 Note regarding comparability The reported results do not include U.S. Xpress' operating results prior to its acquisition by the Company on July 1, 2023 in accordance with the accounting treatment applicable to the transaction. The reported results do not include the LTL operations of DHE prior to its acquisition by the Company on July 30, 2024 in accordance with the accounting treatment applicable to the transaction. Accordingly, comparisons between the Company's current and prior period results may not be meaningful. 
 Seasonality 
 In the full truckload transportation industry, results of operations generally follow a seasonal pattern. Freight volumes in the first quarter are typically lower due to less consumer demand, customers reducing shipments following the holiday season, and inclement weather. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, and tractor productivity of the Company's Truckload fleet, independent contractors and third-party carriers decreases during the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold weather-related equipment maintenance and repairs, and increased insurance claims and costs attributed to higher accident frequency from harsh weather. These factors typically lead to lower operating profitability, as compared to other parts of the year. Additionally, beginning in the latter half of the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter, the Company typically experiences surges pertaining to holiday shopping trends toward delivery of gifts purchased over the Internet, as well as the length of the holiday season (consumer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas). However, as the Company continues to diversify its business through expansion into the LTL industry, warehousing, and other activities, seasonal volatility is becoming more tempered. Additionally, macroeconomic trends and cyclical changes in the trucking industry, including imbalances in supply and demand, can override the seasonality faced in the industry.

Executive Summary 
 
 Company Overview 
 Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. is one of North America's largest and most diversified freight transportation companies, providing multiple full truckload, LTL, intermodal, and other complementary services. Our objective is to operate our business with industry-leading margins and continued organic growth and growth through acquisitions while providing safe, high-quality, cost-effective solutions for our customers. Knight-Swift uses a nationwide network of business units and terminals in the US and Mexico to serve customers throughout North America. In addition to operating the country's largest truckload fleet, Knight-Swift also contracts with third-party equipment providers to provide a broad range of transportation services to our customers while creating quality driving jobs for our driving associates and successful business opportunities for independent contractors. Our four reportable segments are Truckload, LTL, Logistics, and Intermodal. Additionally, we have various non-reportable segments. 
 Key Financial Highlights Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 
 Consolidated operating income decreased 48.3 to 165.4 million during the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year. Net income attributable to Knight-Swift decreased 78.9 to 48.1 million. 
 Truckload 97.6 operating ratio during the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024. The Adjusted Operating Ratio 1 was 96.7 , with a 14.9 year-over-year increase in revenue, excluding fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions, as a result of the inclusion of the truckload business of U.S. Xpress. Adjusted Operating Ratio worsened by 520 basis points year-over-year primarily due to the 4.8 decline in revenue per loaded mile, excluding fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions, and the 1.3 increase in cost per mile largely due to inflationary prices. 
 LTL 91.5 operating ratio during the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024. The Adjusted Operating Ratio 1 increased 330 basis points year-over-year to 88.5 , primarily as a result of incremental operating, maintenance, and labor costs as we expand. We opened 34 new locations during the year-to-date period of 2024, and we acquired the assets of DHE effective July 30,2024, as we continue to grow our network. 
 Logistics 96.5 operating ratio during the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024. The Adjusted Operating Ratio 1 was 95.7 with a gross margin of 17.5 while revenue, excluding intersegment transactions, decreased 2.7 , including the U.S. Xpress logistics business. Load count decreased 11.5 due to the soft demand environment. 
 Intermodal 102.8 operating ratio during the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024, as revenue per load declined 10.0 year-over-year and load count increased 1.3 . 
 All Other Segments Operating loss decreased to 10.3 million during the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024 from 28.1 million during the comparable period of 2023, l argely as a result of exiting the third-party insurance business. 
 Liquidity and Capital During the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024, we generated 524.7 million in operating cash flows and Free Cash Flow 1 of 116.2 million, which was negatively impacted by our decision to transfer 161.1 million of third-party insurance claim liabilities to another insurance company as discussed during the previous quarter, funded by transferring the corresponding restricted cash held in trust for payment of the third-party insurance claims. The use of restricted cash in this transaction does not impact the availability of operating cash for the needs of our ongoing businesses. We paid down 112.3 million in finance lease liabilities, 147.0 million in operating lease liabilities, and made 92.2 million of net repayments on our 2021 Revolver and 2023 RSA. As of September 30, 2024, we had a balance of 166.3 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, 1.4 billion face value outstanding on the 2021 Term Loans and 2023 Term Loan, and 7.1 billion of stockholders' equity. We do not foresee material liquidity constraints or any issues with our ongoing ability to meet our debt covenants. See discussion under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information.

 Market Trends and Outlook 
 The national unemployment rate was 4.1 1 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.8 as of September 30, 2023. The US gross domestic product, which is the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, increased by 3.0 2 on a quarter-over-quarter basis, per the most recent third-party forecasts. The increase, compared to the prior quarter increase of 1.6 , primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, private inventory investment, and nonresidential fixed investments. These were partially offset by increased imports. The most recent US employment cost index indicates a quarter-over-quarter increase of 4.1 1 and a sequential increase of 0.9 1 . 
 Our Company outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 includes the following: 
 Truckload 
 Truckload Segment revenue up slightly sequentially in the fourth quarter and down low-to-mid single-digit percent sequentially into the first quarter with operating margins improving modestly sequentially in the fourth quarter and declining modestly sequentially into the first quarter, 
 Tractor count down low single-digit percent sequentially in the fourth and first quarters. 
 LTL 
 LTL Segment with high-teens percent growth in revenue, excluding fuel surcharge, year-over-year in both fourth and first quarters driven by shipment count growth from our expanding network, the inclusion of DHE, and yield improvement, 
 Adjusted operating ratios in the high 80's as we continue to absorb costs from our network expansion. 
 Logistics 
 Logistics Segment revenue up high single-digit percent sequentially in the fourth quarter and declining high-teens percent sequentially in the first quarter, with Adjusted Operating Ratios in the mid-90 s. 
 Intermodal 
 Intermodal Segment load count down mid-to-high single-digit percent sequentially in the fourth quarter before growing low single-digit percent sequentially in the first quarter with approximately break-even operating margins. 
 All Other 
 All Other Segment operating income, before including the 11.7 million quarterly intangible asset amortization, approximately break-even for the fourth quarter as some of these services experience their typical seasonal slowdown, and 16 million to 21 million for the first quarter. 
 Additional 
 Equipment gains to be in the range of 5 million to 10 million per quarter, 
 Net interest expense down modestly sequentially in the fourth quarter and first quarter, 
 Net cash capital expenditures for the full year 2024 expected range of 525 million - 575 million,

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED 

In addition to the above, we expect the Truckload segment will continue to pursue opportunities, as we implement a decentralized operating model within our new U.S. Xpress locations, and the Logistics segment will continue to provide value to our customers through our power-only and traditional brokerage service offerings. Our ACT and MME teams are working together to further build out a super-regional network, which we expanded in the third quarter of 2024 with the DHE Acquisition, that we expect will provide additional yield and revenue opportunities. The Intermodal segment continues to build out its network that aligns with our new rail partners as we pursue a more diversified portfolio of customers. Our All Other Segments are further expanding to complement our other service offerings. 
 We anticipate that depreciation and amortization expense will increase, as a percentage of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge, as we intend to purchase, rather than enter into operating leases, for a majority of our revenue equipment, terminal improvements, or terminal expansions during 2024. With significant tightening in the insurance markets, we may also experience changes in premiums, retention limits, and excess coverage limits in the remainder of 2024. While fuel expense is generally offset by fuel surcharge revenue, our fuel expense, net of truckload and LTL fuel surcharge revenue, may increase in the future, particularly during periods of sharply rising fuel prices. In periods of declining prices the opposite is true. Overall, we remain committed to long-term profitability as we continue to leverage opportunities across the Knight-Swift brands, and efficiently deploy our assets, while maintaining a relentless focus on cost control. This includes seeking acquisition opportunities to improve earnings, gain customers, and reach more professional drivers, as illustrated by the acquisition of U.S. Xpress and our intention to expand the geographic footprint of our LTL network, as illustrated by the DHE Acquisition.

 Operating Results: Third Quarter 2024 compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 The 29.7 million decrease in net income attributable to Knight-Swift to 30.5 million during the third quarter of 2024 from 60.2 million during the same period last year includes the following: 
 Contributor 3.0 million decrease in operating income within our Truckload segment primarily due to a 5.7 decline in loaded miles, partially offset by a 1.3 decrease in cost per mile. 
 Contributor 7.7 million decrease in operating income within our LTL segment primarily due to start-up costs and early stage operations at the recently opened facilities. 
 Contributor 3.7 million decrease in operating income within our Logistics segment due to the 21.1 decrease in load count, partially offset by a 13.6 increase in revenue per load. 
 Contributor 5.0 million increase in consolidated interest expense primarily driven by higher debt balances related to the DHE acquisition and higher interest rates. 
 Contributor 8.3 million decrease in other income, net, primarily due the 12.1 million loss on investment as a result of the write-off of a minority investment in a transportation-adjacent technology venture which ceased operations in the third quarter of 2024.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED 

Contributor 15.4 million increase in consolidated income tax expense, primarily due to a partial release in the third quarter of 2023 of the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. Xpress net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 32.0 , compared to (2.1) for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Offset 3.1 million decrease in operating loss within our Intermodal segment, driven by a 7.2 increase in load count, partially offset by a 5.3 decrease in revenue per load. 
 Offset 11.6 million increase in operating income within the All Other Segments, largely as a result of exiting the third-party insurance business at the end of the first quarter of 2024. 
 Operating Results: Year-To-Date September 30, 2024 Compared to Year-To-Date September 30, 2023 
 The 179.7 million decrease in net income attributable to Knight-Swift to 48.1 million during the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024 from 227.8 million during the same period last year includes the following: 
 Contributor 140.2 million decrease in operating income within our Truckload segment primarily due to a 4.8 decline in revenue per loaded mile, excluding fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions, and a 1.3 increase in cost per mile. 
 Contributor 11.2 million decrease in operating income within our LTL segment due to severe winter weather experienced during the first quarter of 2024 and start-up costs and early stage operations at our recently opened facilities. 
 Contributor 18.8 million decrease in operating income within our Logistics segment due to an 11.5 decline in load count. 
 Contributor 2.0 million increase in operating loss within our Intermodal segment, driven by a 10.0 decrease in revenue per load, partially offset by a 1.3 increase in load count. 
 Contributor 39.3 million increase in consolidated interest expense primarily driven by higher debt balances related to the U.S. Xpress and DHE acquisitions and higher interest rates. 
 Contributor 13.8 million decrease in other income, net, primarily due the 12.1 million loss on investment as a result of the write-off of a minority investment in a transportation-adjacent technology venture which ceased operations in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Offset 17.7 million decrease in operating loss within the All Other Segments, largely as a result of exiting the third-party insurance business at the end of the first quarter. 
 Offset 31.2 million decrease in consolidated income tax expense, primarily due to a reduction of pre-tax income which was partially offset by the partial release in the third quarter of 2023 of the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. Xpress net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.2 for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024, and 19.1 for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023.

Revenue 
 Our truckload services include irregular route and dedicated, refrigerated, expedited, flatbed, and cross-border transportation of various products, goods, and materials for our diverse customer base with approximately 16,300 irregular route and 6,500 dedicated tractors. 
 Our LTL business, which was initially established in 2021 through the ACT Acquisition and later the acquisitions of MME and the LTL division of DHE, provides our customers with regional LTL transportation service through our growing network of over 160 facilities and a door count of approximately 6,000. Our LTL segment operates approximately 3,700 tractors and approximately 9,900 trailers and also provides national coverage to our customers by utilizing partner carriers for areas outside of our direct network. 
 Our Logistics and Intermodal segments provide a multitude of shipping solutions, including additional sources of truckload capacity and alternative transportation modes, by utilizing our vast network of third-party capacity providers and rail providers, as well as certain logistics and freight management services. We offer power-only services through our Logistics segment leveraging our fleet of nearly 91,000 trailers. 
 Our All Other Segments include support services provided to our customers and third-party carriers including equipment maintenance, equipment leasing, warehousing, trailer parts manufacturing, and warranty services, as well as insurance prior to the first quarter of 2024. Our All Other Segments also include certain corporate expenses (such as legal settlements and accruals, certain impairments, and amortization of intangibles related to the 2017 Merger and various acquisitions). 
 In addition to the revenues earned from our customers for the trucking and non-trucking services discussed above, we also earn fuel surcharge revenue from our customers through our fuel surcharge programs, which serve to recover a majority of our fuel costs. This generally applies only to loaded miles for our Truckload and LTL segments and typically does not offset non-paid empty miles, idle time, and out-of-route miles driven. Fuel surcharge programs involve a computation based on the change in national or regional fuel prices. These programs may update as often as weekly, but typically require a specified minimum change in fuel cost to prompt a change in fuel surcharge revenue. Therefore, many of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when the change is reflected in fuel surcharge revenue for our Truckload and LTL segments. 
 Expenses 
 Our most significant expenses typically vary with miles traveled and include fuel, driving associate-related expenses (such as wages and benefits), and services purchased from third-party service providers (including other trucking companies, railroad and drayage providers, and independent contractors). Maintenance and tire expenses, as well as the cost of insurance and claims generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety performance, fleet age, operating efficiency, and other factors. Our primary fixed costs are depreciation and lease expense for revenue equipment and terminals, non-driver employee compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and interest expenses.

Segment Review 
 Truckload Segment 
 We generate revenue in the Truckload segment primarily through irregular route, dedicated, refrigerated, expedited, flatbed, and cross-border service operations across our brands. We operated approximately 16,300 irregular route tractors and approximately 6,500 dedicated route tractors in use during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Generally, we are paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for our truckload services. Additional revenues are generated by charging for tractor and trailer detention, loading and unloading activities, dedicated services, and other specialized services, as well as through the collection of fuel surcharge revenue to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel. The main factors that affect the revenue generated by our Truckload segment are rate per mile from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, and the number of loaded miles we generate with our equipment. 
 The most significant expenses in the Truckload segment are primarily variable and include fuel and fuel taxes, driving associate-related expenses (such as wages, benefits, training, and recruitment), and costs associated with independent contractors primarily included in "Purchased transportation" in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Maintenance expense (which includes costs for replacement tires for our revenue equipment) and insurance and claims expenses have both fixed and variable components. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, fleet age, efficiency, and other factors. The main fixed costs in the Truckload segment are depreciation and rent expense from tractors, trailers, and terminals, as well as compensating our non-driver employees.

4 Our average trailers includes 8,510 and 8,432 trailers related to leasing activities recorded within our All Other Segments for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our average trailers includes 8,718 and 8,599 trailers related to leasing activities recorded within our All Other Segments for the year-to-date periods September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Comparison Between the Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Truckload segment revenue, excluding fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions, declined 6.1 year-over-year, driven by a 5.7 decrease in loaded miles as we lapped the acquisition of U.S. Xpress at the beginning of the quarter. The third quarter Adjusted Operating Ratio was 95.6 in an environment that remained challenging. On a sequential basis, the Adjusted Operating Ratio of our legacy trucking businesses improved 250 basis points over the second quarter, while stable margins at U.S. Xpress negatively impacted this segment's Adjusted Operating Ratio by 220 basis points for the quarter. Third quarter revenue per loaded mile, excluding fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions, was flat year-over-year and increased slightly over the second quarter. The sequential improvement in revenue per loaded mile was achieved through positive rate changes in bid awards and our spot activity which continues to be at a premium to our average contractual revenue per loaded mile. 
 Cost per mile improved 1.3 year-over-year as we continue to focus on what we can control. We are working diligently to improve our cost structure and equipment utilization to mitigate pressure on margins through this prolonged freight cycle while remaining disciplined on pricing and capacity commitments to position our business to respond when market conditions improve. 
 Comparison Between Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 and 2023 Truckload segment revenue, excluding fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions, was 3.3 billion, an increase of 14.9 year-over-year, reflecting a 7.1 decline in the legacy truckload business prior to the inclusion of U.S. Xpress. Adjusted Operating Ratio was 96.7 , largely driven by a 4.8 decrease in revenue per loaded mile, excluding fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions and a 1.3 increase in cost per mile, net of fuel surcharge recovery. 
 
 LTL Segment 
 Dothan, Alabama-based ACT and Bismarck, North Dakota-based MME, both acquired in 2021, and the LTL division of DHE, acquired in 2024, comprise our LTL segment. We provide regional direct service and serve our customers' national transportation needs by utilizing key partner carriers for coverage areas outside of our network. We primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers through our core LTL services. 
 Our revenues are impacted by shipment volume and tonnage levels that flow through our network. Additional revenues are generated through fuel surcharges and accessorial services provided during transit from shipment origin to destination. We focus on the following multiple revenue generation factors when reviewing revenue yield: revenue per hundredweight, revenue per shipment, weight per shipment, and length of haul. Fluctuations within each of these metrics are analyzed when determining the revenue quality of our customers' shipment density. 
 Our most significant expense is related to direct costs associated with the transportation of our freight moves including direct salary, wage and benefit costs, fuel expense, and depreciation expense associated with revenue equipment costs. Other expenses associated with revenue generation that can fluctuate and impact operating results are insurance and claims expenses, as well as maintenance costs of our revenue equipment. These expenses can be influenced by multiple factors including our safety performance, equipment age, and other factors. A key component of lowering our operating costs is labor efficiency within our network. We continue to focus on technological advances to improve the customer experience and reduce our operating costs.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED 

Comparison Between the Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Our LTL segment grew revenue, excluding fuel surcharge, 16.7 as shipments per day increased 11.1 year-over-year. Our previously announced acquisition of DHE on July 30, 2024 contributed approximately 7.5 to each of these improvements and added the key Southwest markets of California, Arizona, and Nevada to our network. Revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased 9.2 , while revenue per shipment, excluding fuel surcharge, increased by 4.8 , reflecting a 3.9 decrease in weight per shipment. This segment produced an 89.6 Adjusted Operating Ratio during the third quarter, and Adjusted Operating Income decreased 19.5 year-over-year due to start-up costs and sub-scale operations at our recently opened facilities. 
 During the quarter, we opened 16 additional service centers following 18 openings in the first half of the year. We expect to open 4 more service centers by the end of 2024. Also, our DHE acquisition represents approximately 10 growth in both service centers and door count for our LTL network. Overall, our organic and inorganic expansion activities in 2024 should add nearly 1,500 doors, representing a 32.2 increase to our door count from the beginning of the year. We believe this meaningfully impacts the reach of our service offering and increases the density of our network. We believe the investments we are making in our network during 2024 bring opportunities to service additional freight and customers, though the associated set-up costs and initial operational inefficiencies are near-term headwinds to improving margins. Our focus for 2025 will be to have these locations continue to scale, particularly as they participate in the next bid cycle, to help drive growth and margin expansion in the business. We continue to look for both organic and inorganic opportunities to geographically expand our footprint within the LTL market. 
 Comparison Between Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 and 2023 The LTL segment produced an 88.5 Adjusted Operating Ratio during the year-to-date period ending September 30, 2024, as revenue, excluding fuel surcharge, increased 14.9 . Adjusted Operating Income decreased 10.5 due to severe winter weather experienced during the first quarter of 2024 and start-up costs and early stage operations at our recently opened facilities. Average shipments per day increased 8.7 . Revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased 11.8 , while revenue per shipment, excluding fuel surcharge, increased 6.8 , reflecting a 4.6 decrease in weight per shipment. 
 
 Logistics Segment 
 The Logistics segment is less asset-intensive than the Truckload and LTL segments and is dependent upon capable non-driver employees, modern and effective information technology, and third-party capacity providers. Logistics revenue is generated by its brokerage operations. We generate additional revenue by offering specialized logistics solutions (including, but not limited to, trailing equipment, origin management, surge volume, disaster relief, special projects, and other logistics needs). Logistics revenue is mainly affected by the rates we obtain from customers, the freight volumes we ship through third-party capacity providers, and our ability to secure third-party capacity providers to transport customer freight. 
 The most significant expense in the Logistics segment is purchased transportation that we pay to third-party capacity providers, which is primarily a variable cost and is included in "Purchased transportation" in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Variability in this expense depends on truckload capacity, availability of third-party capacity providers, rates charged to customers, current freight demand, and customer shipping needs. Fixed Logistics operating expenses primarily include non-driver employee compensation and benefits recorded in "Salaries, wages, and benefits" and depreciation and amortization expense recorded in "Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment" in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

 Comparison Between the Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The Logistics segment Adjusted Operating Ratio was 94.5 , with a gross margin of 17.8 in the third quarter of 2024. Logistics load count was down 21.1 year-over-year as we lapped the acquisition of the U.S. Xpress logistics business at the beginning of the quarter, though load count improved 5.5 over the second quarter. Revenue per load increased year-over-year by 13.6 in the third quarter. We remain disciplined on price and diligent in carrier qualification to provide value to customers while maintaining profitability. We continue to leverage our power-only capabilities to complement our asset business, build a broader and more diversified freight portfolio, and to enhance the returns on our capital assets. 
 Comparison Between Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 and 2023 The Logistics segment Adjusted Operating Ratio was 95.7 , with a gross margin of 17.5 in the year-to-date period ending September 30, 2024, down from 19.0 in the same period of the prior year. Logistics load count decreased 11.5 , reflecting the inclusion of U.S. Xpress logistics volumes. Revenue per load increased by 8.8 year-over-year, largely driven by the inclusion of U.S. Xpress logistics in the current period, as it has a different business mix. 
 
 Intermodal Segment 
 The Intermodal segment complements our regional operating model, allows us to better serve customers in longer haul lanes, and reduces our investment in fixed assets. Through the Intermodal segment, we generate revenue by moving freight over the rail in our containers and other trailing equipment, combined with revenue for drayage to transport loads between railheads and customer locations. The most significant expense in the Intermodal segment is the cost of purchased transportation that we pay to third-party capacity providers (including rail providers), which is primarily variable and included in "Purchased transportation" in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. While rail pricing is determined on an annual basis, purchased transportation varies as it relates to rail capacity, freight demand, and customer shipping needs. The main fixed costs in the Intermodal segment are depreciation of our company tractors related to drayage, containers, and chassis, as well as non-driver employee compensation and benefits.

Results of Operations Consolidated Operating and Other Expenses 
 
 Consolidated Operating Expenses 
 The following tables present certain operating expenses from our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, including each operating expense as a percentage of total revenue and as a percentage of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge. Truckload and LTL fuel surcharge revenue can be volatile and is primarily dependent upon the cost of fuel, rather than operating expenses unrelated to fuel. Therefore, we believe that revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge is a better measure for analyzing many of our expenses and operating metrics. 
 Note: The reported results do not include U.S. Xpress' operating results prior to its acquisition by the Company on July 1, 2023 in accordance with the accounting treatment applicable to the transaction. The reported results do not include the LTL operations of DHE prior to its acquisition by the Company on July 30, 2024 in accordance with the accounting treatment applicable to the transaction. Accordingly, comparisons between the Company's current and prior periods may not be meaningful.

 Salaries, wages, and benefits expense is primarily affected by the total number of miles driven by and rates we pay to our company driving associates, and employee benefits including healthcare, workers' compensation, and other benefits. To a lesser extent, non-driver employee headcount, compensation, and benefits affect this expense. Driving associate wages represent the largest component of salaries, wages, and benefits expense. 
 Several ongoing market factors have reduced the pool of available driving associates, contributing to a challenging driver sourcing market, which we believe will continue. Having a sufficient number of qualified driving associates is a significant headwind, although we continue to seek ways to attract and retain qualified driving associates, including heavily investing in our recruiting efforts, our driving academies, technology, our equipment, and our terminals that improve the experience of driving associates. We expect labor costs (related to both driving associates and non-driver employees) to remain inflationary, which we expect will result in additional pay increases in the future, thereby increasing our salaries, wages, and benefits expense. 
 Comparison Between the Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The 15.8 million increase in consolidated salaries, wages, and benefits for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023, is primarily due to a 24.6 million increase in LTL wages as a result of service center expansion, the DHE Acquisition, and labor to support increased shipment count from expansion efforts. This was partially offset by a 12.8 million decrease in Truckload driver mileage pay primarily due to the 5.7 decrease in loaded miles. 
 Comparison Between Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 and 2023 The 330.6 million increase in consolidated salaries, wages, and benefits for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023, includes a 276.8 million increase from the results of U.S. Xpress and a 56.0 million increase in LTL wages as a result of shipment count growth facilitated by new service centers.

 Fuel expense consists primarily of diesel fuel expense for our company-owned tractors. The primary factors affecting our fuel expense are the cost of diesel fuel, the fuel economy of our equipment, and the miles driven by company driving associates. 
 Our fuel surcharge programs help to offset increases in fuel prices, but generally apply only to loaded miles for our Truckload and LTL segments and typically do not offset non-paid empty miles, idle time, or out-of-route miles driven. Typical fuel surcharge programs involve a computation based on the change in national or regional fuel prices. These programs may update as often as weekly, but typically require a specified minimum change in fuel cost to prompt a change in fuel surcharge revenue for our Truckload and LTL segments. Therefore, many of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when the change is reflected in fuel surcharge revenue. Due to this time lag, our fuel expense, net of fuel surcharge, negatively impacts our operating income during periods of sharply rising fuel costs and positively impacts our operating income during periods of falling fuel costs. We continue to utilize our fuel efficiency initiatives such as trailer blades, idle-control, management of tractor speeds, fleet updates for more fuel-efficient engines, management of fuel procurement, and driving associate training programs that we believe contribute to controlling our fuel expense. 
 Comparison Between Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The 58.9 million decrease in consolidated fuel expense for the third quarter of 2024 is primarily driven by the 5.2 decrease in Truckload total miles and the decrease in the average weekly DOE fuel prices for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. Average weekly DOE fuel prices were 3.69 per gallon for the third quarter of 2024 and 4.27 per gallon for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Comparison Between Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 and 2023 The 42.2 million increase in consolidated fuel expense for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024 includes a 95.1 million increase from the results of U.S. Xpress. The increase was partially offset by the decrease in the average weekly DOE fuel prices for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. Average weekly DOE fuel prices were 3.83 per gallon for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024 and 4.20 per gallon for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023.

 Operations and maintenance expense consists of direct operating expenses, such as driving associate hiring and recruiting expenses, equipment maintenance, and tire expense. Operations and maintenance expenses are typically affected by the age of our company-owned fleet of tractors and trailers and the miles driven. We expect the driver market to remain competitive throughout 2024, which could increase future driving associate development and recruiting costs and negatively affect our operations and maintenance expense. We expect to prudently decrease our idle tractor and trailer capacity, in the coming quarters, to reduce operations and maintenance expense while remaining well positioned for potential market inflection. 
 Comparison Between Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Operations and maintenance expense remained relatively flat for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period last year. 
 Comparison Between Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 and 2023 Operations and maintenance expense increased 71.7 million for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year.

 Insurance and claims expense consists of premiums for liability, physical damage, and cargo, and will vary based upon the frequency and severity of claims, our level of self-insurance, and premium expense. In recent years, insurance carriers have raised premiums for many businesses, including transportation companies, and as a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase in the future, or we could raise our self-insured retention limits or reduce excess coverage limits when our policies are renewed or replaced. Insurance and claims expense also varies based on the number of miles driven by company driving associates and independent contractors, the frequency and severity of accidents, trends in development factors used in actuarial accruals, and developments in large, prior-year claims. In future periods, our higher self-insured retention limits and lower excess coverage limits, may cause increased volatility in our consolidated insurance and claims expense. 
 In the first quarter of 2024, we exited our third-party insurance business, which offered insurance products to third-party carriers, earning premium revenues, which were partially offset by increased insurance reserves, and which exposed us to claims and inability to collect premiums. We ceased operating this business in the first quarter of 2024, which we expect will result in some reduction of volatility as we will no longer be exposed to new claims from the third-party insurance business.

 Depreciation relates primarily to our owned tractors, trailers, buildings, electronic logging devices, other communication units, and other similar assets. Changes to this fixed cost are generally attributed to increases or decreases to company-owned equipment, the relative percentage of owned versus leased equipment, and fluctuations in new equipment purchase prices. Depreciation can also be affected by the cost of used equipment that we sell or trade and the replacement of older used equipment. Management periodically reviews the condition, average age, and reasonableness of estimated useful lives and salvage values of our equipment and considers such factors in light of our experience with similar assets, used equipment market conditions, and prevailing industry practices. 
 Comparison Between Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Consolidated depreciation and amortization of property and equipment remained relatively flat for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period last year. 
 Comparison Between Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 and 2023 Consolidated depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased by 50.4 million for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year. The increase includes a 60.1 million increase from the results of U.S. Xpress, partially offset by a decrease in our legacy Truckload tractor depreciation due to a decrease in its tractor count. With the inclusion of U.S. Xpress, tractor count increased year-over-year. 
 We anticipate that depreciation and amortization expense will increase, as a percentage of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge, as we intend to purchase, rather than enter into operating leases, for a majority of our revenue equipment, terminal improvements, or terminal expansions in the remainder of 2024.

 Purchased transportation expense is comprised of payments to independent contractors in our trucking operations, as well as payments to third-party capacity providers related to logistics, freight management, and non-trucking services in our logistics and intermodal businesses. Purchased transportation is generally affected by capacity in the market as well as changes in fuel prices. As capacity tightens, our payments to third-party capacity providers and to independent contractors tend to increase. Additionally, as fuel prices increase, payments to third-party capacity providers and independent contractors increase. Purchased transportation expense may also fluctuate as a percentage of revenue based on the relative growth of our logistics and intermodal businesses as compared to our full truckload and LTL businesses. 
 Comparison Between Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Consolidated purchased transportation expense decreased 35.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period last year. The decrease is primarily driven by the decrease in load volume within our logistics business.

The decrease is primarily due to decreased load volume within our logistics business, partially offset by the increase of 143.1 million from the results of U.S. Xpress.

 Interest expense Interest expense is comprised of debt and finance lease interest expense as well as amortization of deferred loan costs. The increase in interest expense during the third quarter and the year-to-date period ended of 2024 was primarily due to higher debt balances related to the acquisitions of U.S. Xpress and DHE. Additional details regarding our debt are discussed in Note 6 in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Other (income) expenses, net Other (income) expenses, net is primarily comprised of losses and (gains) from our various equity investments, as well as certain other non-operating income and expense items that may arise outside of the normal course of business. 
 Comparison Between the Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The 8.3 million decrease in other (income) expenses, net is primarily driven by a 12.1 million write-off of a minority investment in a transportation-adjacent technology venture which ceased operations in the third quarter. This was partially offset by an increase in the net gain recorded within our remaining portfolio of investments during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Comparison Between Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 and 2023 The 13.8 million decrease in other (income) expenses, net is primarily driven by a 12.1 million write-off of a minority investment in a transportation-adjacent technology venture which ceased operations in the third quarter. The remaining decrease is a result of the net loss recorded within our remaining portfolio of investments during the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024.

Income tax expense (benefit) In addition to the discussion below, Note 4 in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report provides further analysis related to income taxes. 
 Comparison Between the Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The 15.4 million increase in consolidated income tax expense (benefit) was primarily due to the partial release in the third quarter of 2023 of the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. Xpress net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 32.0 , compared to (2.1) for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Comparison Between Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 and 2023 The 31.2 million decrease in consolidated income tax expense (benefit) was primarily due to a reduction of pre-tax income which was partially offset by the partial release in the third quarter of 2023 of the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. Xpress net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.2 for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024, and 19.1 for the year-to-date period ending September 30, 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The terms "Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Knight-Swift," "Adjusted EPS," "Adjusted Operating Income," "Adjusted Operating Ratio," and "Free Cash Flow," as we define them, are not presented in accordance with GAAP. These financial measures supplement our GAAP results in evaluating certain aspects of our business. We believe that using these measures improves comparability in analyzing our performance because they remove the impact of items from our operating results that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance. Management and the Board focus on Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Knight-Swift, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Income, and Adjusted Operating Ratio as key measures of our performance, all of which are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures and further discussed below. Management and the Board use Free Cash Flow as a key measure of our liquidity. Free Cash Flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. We believe our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance. 
 Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Knight-Swift, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Ratio, and Free Cash Flow are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income, cash flows from operating activities, operating income, or other measures prescribed by GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Although we believe that they improve comparability in analyzing our period to period performance, they could limit comparability to other companies in our industry if those companies define these measures differently. Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered measures of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis. 
 Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the following tables reconcile GAAP consolidated net income attributable to Knight-Swift to non-GAAP consolidated Adjusted Net Income attributable to Knight-Swift, GAAP consolidated earnings per diluted share to non-GAAP consolidated Adjusted EPS, GAAP consolidated operating ratio to non-GAAP consolidated Adjusted Operating Ratio, GAAP reportable segment operating income to non-GAAP reportable segment Adjusted Operating Income, GAAP reportable segment operating ratio to non-GAAP reportable segment Adjusted Operating Ratio, and GAAP cash flow from operations to non-GAAP Free Cash Flow.

Uses of Liquidity 
 Our business requires substantial amounts of cash for operating activities, including salaries and wages paid to our employees, contract payments to independent contractors, insurance and claims payments, tax payments, and others. We also use large amounts of cash and credit for the following activities: 
 Capital Expenditures When justified by customer demand, as well as our liquidity and our ability to generate acceptable returns, we make substantial cash capital expenditures to maintain a modern company tractor fleet, refresh and expand our trailer fleet, expand our network of LTL service centers, and, to a lesser extent, fund upgrades to our terminals and technology in our various service offerings. In connection with our business strategy, we regularly evaluate acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities. We expect net cash capital expenditures, will be in the range of 525.0 575.0 million for full-year 2024. Our expected net cash capital expenditures primarily represent replacements of existing tractors and trailers and investments in our terminal network, driver amenities, and technology, and excludes acquisitions. We believe we have ample flexibility in our trade cycle and purchase agreements to alter our current plans if economic and other conditions warrant. 
 Over the long-term, we will continue to have significant capital requirements, which may require us to seek additional borrowing, lease financing, or equity capital. The availability of financing or equity capital will depend upon our financial condition and results of operations as well as prevailing market conditions. If such additional borrowing, lease financing, or equity capital is not available at the time we need it, then we may need to borrow more under the 2021 Revolver (if not then fully drawn), extend the maturity of then-outstanding debt, rely on alternative financing arrangements, engage in asset sales, limit our fleet size, or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods. 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt under our existing financial arrangements to satisfy our ongoing capital requirements. However, we believe the combination of our expected cash flows, financing available through operating and finance leases, available funds under our accounts receivable securitization, and availability under the 2021 Revolver will be sufficient to fund our expected capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. 
 Principal and Interest Payments As of September 30, 2024, we had debt, accounts receivable securitization, and finance lease obligations of 2.9 billion, which are discussed under "Material Debt Agreements," below. Certain cash flows from operations are committed to minimum payments of principal and interest on our debt and lease obligations. Additionally, when our financial position allows, we periodically make voluntary prepayments on our outstanding debt balances. 
 Letters of Credit Pursuant to the terms of the 2021 Debt Agreement and the 2023 RSA, our lenders may issue standby letters of credit on our behalf. When we have certain letters of credit outstanding, the availability under the 2021 Revolver or 2023 RSA is reduced accordingly. As of September 30, 2024, we also had outstanding letters of credit of 248.0 million pursuant to a bilateral agreement which do not impact the availability of the 2021 Revolver and 2023 RSA. Standby letters of credit are typically issued for the benefit of regulatory authorities, insurance companies and state departments of insurance for the purpose of satisfying certain collateral requirements, primarily related to our automobile, workers' compensation, and general insurance liabilities. 
 Share Repurchases From time to time, and depending on Free Cash Flow 1 availability, debt levels, common stock prices, general economic and market conditions, as well as internal approval requirements, we may repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 200.0 million remaining under the 2022 Knight-Swift Share Repurchase Plan. Additional details regarding our share repurchase plans are discussed in Note 10 in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

Working Capital 
 We had a working capital surplus of 8.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and a working capital deficit of 116.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The change in our working capital is primarily attributed to the 2024 Amendment which extended the maturity related to the 2021 Term Loan A-2 from September 2024 to September 2026. 
 Material Debt Agreements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.9 billion in material debt obligations at the following carrying values: 
 349.0 million: 2021 Term Loan A-2, due September 2026, net of 1.0 million in deferred loan costs 
 789.3 million: 2021 Term Loan A-3, due September 2026, net of 0.7 million in deferred loan costs 
 249.4 million: 2023 Term Loan, due September 2026, net of 0.6 million in deferred loan costs 
 458.9 million: 2023 RSA outstanding borrowings, net of 0.3 million in deferred loan costs 
 609.8 million: Finance lease obligations 
 227.0 million: 2021 Revolver, due September 2026 
 219.5 million: Revenue equipment installment notes 
 23.7 million: Other, net of approximately 13,000 in deferred loan costs 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had 2.7 billion in material debt obligations at the following carrying values: 
 199.9 million: 2021 Term Loan A-2, due September 2024, net of 0.1 million in deferred loan costs 
 799.1 million: 2021 Term Loan A-3, due September 2026, net of 0.9 million in deferred loan costs 
 249.1 million: 2023 Term Loan, due September 2026, net of 0.9 million in deferred loan costs 
 526.5 million: 2023 RSA outstanding borrowings, net of 0.5 million in deferred loan costs 
 528.9 million: Finance lease obligations

 Cash Flow Analysis 
 
 Year-to-Date September 30, Change 2024 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 524,741 873,502 (348,761) Net cash used in investing activities (619,020) (1,088,030) 469,010 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (54,495) 286,090 (340,585) 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Comparison Between Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 and 2023 The 348.8 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities included a 154.4 million decrease in operating income for year-to-date September 30, 2024, a 161.1 million cash payment for a commutation agreement to transfer certain outstanding insurance reserves to a third party, and a 46.3 million increase in cash paid for interest. This was partially offset by a 28.1 million decrease in cash paid for income taxes. Note: Factors affecting the increase in operating income are discussed in "Results of Operations Consolidated Operating and Other Expenses."

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Comparison Between Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 and 2023 The 469.0 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a 230.0 million decrease in net cash capital expenditures and a 272.8 million decrease in cash used on acquisitions. 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Comparison Between Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 and 2023 Net cash used in financing activities increased by 340.6 million, primarily due to a 133.5 million increase in repayments on our finance leases and long-term debt, 100.0 million decrease in proceeds from our long-term debt, and 97.0 million decrease in net proceeds from our 2021 Revolver. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Discussion regarding the impact of seasonality on our business is included in Note 1 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, incorporated by reference herein. 
 Inflation 
 
 Most of our operating expenses are inflation-sensitive, with inflation generally leading to increased costs of operations. Price increases in manufactured revenue equipment has impacted the cost for us to acquire new equipment. Cost increases have also impacted the cost of parts for equipment repairs and maintenance. The qualified driver shortage experienced by the trucking industry overall has had the effect of increasing compensation paid to our driving associates. We have also experienced inflation in insurance and claims cost related to health insurance and claims as well as auto liability insurance and claims. Prolonged periods of inflation have recently and could continue to cause interest rates, fuel, wages, and other costs to increase as well. Any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations unless freight rates correspondingly increase. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 2 in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, which is incorporated herein by reference, for the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We have exposure from variable interest rates, primarily related to our 2021 Debt Agreement, 2023 Term Loan, and 2023 RSA. These variable interest rates are impacted by changes in short-term interest rates. We primarily manage interest rate exposure through a mix of variable rate debt (weighted average rate of 6.6 as of September 30, 2024) and fixed rate equipment lease financing. Assuming the level of borrowings as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by 20.9 million. 
 58 

Table of Contents Glossary of Terms 
 KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC. 

 Commodity Price Risk 
 We have commodity exposure with respect to fuel used in company-owned tractors. Increases in fuel prices would continue to raise our operating costs, even after applying fuel surcharge revenue. Historically, we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges. The weekly average diesel price per gallon in the US decreased to 3.69 for the third quarter of 2024 from an average of 4.27 in the third quarter of 2023. The weekly average diesel price per gallon decreased to 3.83 for year-to-date September 30, 2024 from an average price of 4.20 for year-to-date September 30, 2023. We cannot predict the extent or speed of potential changes in fuel price levels in the future, the degree to which the lag effect of our fuel surcharge programs will impact us as a result of the timing and magnitude of such changes, or the extent to which effective fuel surcharges can be maintained and collected to offset such increases. We generally have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our fuel price exposure in the past, but continue to evaluate this possibility. To mitigate the impact of rising fuel costs, we contract with some of our fuel suppliers to buy fuel at a fixed price or within banded pricing for a specified period, usually not exceeding twelve months. However, these purchase commitments only cover a small portion of our fuel consumption. Accordingly, fuel price fluctuations may still negatively impact us. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We base our internal control over financial reporting on the criteria set forth in the 2013 COSO Internal Control: Integrated Framework. 
 We have confidence in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors, misstatements, or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

The failure of any Lender to make available its Commitment Percentage of any Loan requested by the Borrower shall not relieve it or any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Commitment Percentage of such Loan available on the borrowing date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make its Commitment Percentage of such Loan available on the borrowing date. 
 (d) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent .

 (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining one month, three month and six month interest periods of BSBY Term SOFR including, without limitation, because the BSBY Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or 
 (ii) Bloomberg CME or any successor administrator of the BSBY Term SOFR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having or purporting to have jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or Bloomberg or such administrator has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which one month, three month and six month interest periods of BSBY Term SOFR or the BSBY Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of Dollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease , or that such interest periods or BSBY Screen Rate have failed to comply with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will continue to provide such representative interest periods of BSBY Term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date on which one month, three month , and six month interest periods of BSBY Term SOFR or the BSBY Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, the Scheduled Unavailability Date 
 (B) solely on one occasion occurring prior to December 31, 2022, the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent in writing (which notice shall be made 
 CHAR1 1818058v8 13693653v5 

available to the Lenders) that the Borrower elects to replace BSBY hereunder with an alternative benchmark, 
 
 CHAR1 1818058v8 13693653v5 

then, in the case of either clause (A) or clause (B) above, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the BSBY Term SOFR Replacement Date ), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause A)( ii) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, BSBY Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate, as applicable, will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan Document with , subject to the proviso below, the first available alternative set forth in the order below Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the Successor Rate

 (y) Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment 
 provided that, if initially BSBY is replaced with the rate contained in clause (y) above (Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment) and subsequent to such replacement, the Administrative Agent determines that Term SOFR has become available and is administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, and the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and each Lender of such availability, then from and after the beginning of the Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, in each case, commencing no less than thirty (30) days after the date of such notice, the Successor Rate shall be Term SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment. 
 If the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment, all interest payments will be payable on a quarterly basis. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the Administrative Agent determines that neither of the alternatives set forth in clauses (x) and (y) above is Daily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the BSBY Term SOFR Replacement Date or (ii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 5.8(b)( A)( i) or (A) (ii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing BSBY Term SOFR, the Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate or any then current Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 5.8 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar Dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such 
 CHAR1 1818058v8 13693653v5 

alternative benchmarks and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for 
 
 CHAR1 1818058v8 13693653v5 

similar Dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such benchmarks which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark . For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments shall constitute a Successor Rate . Any such amendment shall become effective at 5 00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. 
 The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate. 
 Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent , in consultation with the Borrower .

 (c) Illegality .

 CHAR1 1818058v8 13693653v5 

SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to BSBY Rate Term SOFR Loans or BSBY Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such 
 
 CHAR1 1818058v8 13693653v5 

notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the BSBY Rate Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the BSBY Rate Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all BSBY Rate Term SOFR Loans and or BSBY Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans, as applicable, of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the BSBY Rate Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period or payment period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such BSBY Rate Term SOFR Loans and or BSBY Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such BSBY Rate Term SOFR Loans and or BSBY Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans and (B) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the BSBY Rate SOFR , the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the BSBY Rate Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the BSBY Rate SOFR . Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 5.9 .

 CHAR1 1818058v8 13693653v5 

any reasonable attribution or averaging methods which such Lender deems appropriate and practical. A certificate of such Lender setting forth the basis for determining such amount or amounts necessary 
 
 CHAR1 1818058v8 13693653v5 

to compensate such Lender shall be forwarded to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent and shall be conclusively presumed to be correct save for manifest error.

 (e) Indemnification by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified 
 CHAR1 1818058v8 13693653v5

 CHAR1 1818058v8 13693653v5 

obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.9(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the applicable Credit Party or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the applicable Credit Party or the Administrative Agent as will enable the applicable Credit Party or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 5.11(g)(ii)(1) , (ii)(2) and (ii)(4) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material

 CHAR1 1818058v8 13693653v5

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
