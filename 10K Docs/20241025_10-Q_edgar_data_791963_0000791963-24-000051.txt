 The Company is constantly assessing its needs for office space and, on a rolling basis, has many leases that expire in any given year. 
 
 Substantially all of the leases are held by the Company's subsidiary, Viner Finance Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 
 
 Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Most leases include an option to renew and the exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion. The Company did not include the renewal options as part of the right of use assets and liabilities. 
 
 The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had right-of-use operating lease assets of million (net of accumulated amortization of million) which are comprised of real estate leases of million (net of accumulated amortization of million) and equipment leases of million (net of accumulated amortization of million). As of September 30, 2024, the Company had operating lease liabilities of million which are comprised of real estate lease liabilities of million and equipment lease liabilities of million. The Company had no finance leases as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate on January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date for the operating leases that commenced subsequent to January 1, 2019.

 Advisory Fees 
 The Company earns management and performance (or incentive) fees in connection with the advisory and asset management services it provides to various types of funds, asset-based programs and investment vehicles through its subsidiaries. Management fees are generally based on the account value at the valuation date per the respective asset management agreements and are recognized over time as the customer receives the benefits of the services evenly throughout the term of the contract. Performance fees are recognized when the return on client AUM exceeds a specified benchmark return or other performance targets over a 12-month measurement period are met. Performance fees are considered variable as they are subject to fluctuation and/or are contingent on a future event over the measurement period and are not subject to adjustment once the measurement period ends. Such fees are computed as of the fund's year-end when the measurement period ends and generally are recorded as earned in the fourth quarter of the Company's fiscal year. Both management and performance fees are generally received within days. 
 Investment Banking 
 The Company earns underwriting revenues by providing capital raising solutions for corporate clients through initial public offerings, follow-on offerings, equity-linked offerings, private investments in public entities, and private placements. Underwriting revenues are recognized at a point in time on trade date, as the client obtains the control and benefit of the capital markets offering at that time. These fees are generally received within days after the transactions are completed. Transaction-related expenses, primarily consisting of legal, travel and other costs directly associated with the transaction, are deferred and recognized in the same period as the related investment banking transaction revenue. Underwriting revenues and related expenses are presented gross on the consolidated income statements. 
 Revenue from financial advisory services includes fees generated in connection with mergers, acquisitions and restructuring transactions. Such revenue and fees are primarily recorded at a point in time when services for the performance obligations have been completed and income is reasonably determinable, generally as set forth under the terms of the engagement. Payment for advisory services is generally due upon a completion of the transaction or milestone. Retainer fees and fees earned from certain advisory services are recognized ratably over the service period as the customer receives the benefit of the services throughout the term of the contracts, and such fees are collected based on the terms of the contracts. 
 
 Bank Deposit Sweep Income 
 Bank deposit sweep income consists of revenue earned from the FDIC-insured bank deposit program. Under this program, client funds are swept into deposit accounts at participating banks and are eligible for FDIC deposit insurance up to FDIC standard maximum deposit insurance amounts. Fees are earned over time and are generally received within days.

 Contract Assets and Liabilities 
 The timing of the Company's revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by its customers. The Company records contract assets when payment is due from a client conditioned on future performance or the occurrence of other events. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, the Company records deferred revenue until the performance obligations are satisfied.

Risks managed using derivative instruments include interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange risk. All derivative instruments are measured at fair value and are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

 The Company receives collateral in connection with securities borrowed and reverse repurchase agreement transactions and customer margin loans. Under many agreements, the Company is permitted to sell or re-pledge the securities received (e.g., use the securities to enter into securities lending transactions, or deliver to counterparties to cover short positions). As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of securities received as collateral under securities borrowed transactions and reverse repurchase agreements was million million as of December 31, 2023) and million million as of December 31, 2023), respectively, of which the Company has sold and re-pledged approximately million million as of December 31, 2023) under securities loaned transactions and million under repurchase agreements million as of December 31, 2023). 
 The Company pledges certain of its securities owned for securities lending and repurchase agreements and to collateralize bank call loan transactions. The carrying value of pledged securities owned that can be sold or re-pledged by the counterparty was million, as presented on the face of the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 million as of December 31, 2023). 
 The Company manages credit exposure arising from repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements by, in appropriate circumstances, entering into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties that provide the Company, in the event of a customer default, the right to liquidate securities and the right to offset a counterparty's rights and obligations. The Company manages market risk of repurchase agreements and securities loaned by monitoring the market value of collateral held and the market value of securities receivable from others. It is the Company's policy to request and obtain additional collateral when exposure to loss exists. In the event the counterparty is unable to meet its contractual obligation to return the securities, the Company may be exposed to off-balance sheet risk of acquiring securities at prevailing market prices.

major U.S. broker-dealers totaling approximately million. Included in receivable from customers as of September 30, 2024 were fully secured margin loans from our largest customer accounts totaling approximately million. 
 The Company is obligated to settle transactions with brokers and other financial institutions even if its clients fail to meet their obligations to the Company. Clients are required to complete their transactions on the settlement date, generally one business day after the trade date. If clients do not fulfill their contractual obligations, the Company may incur losses. The Company has clearing/participating arrangements with the National Securities Clearing Corporation, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation ("FICC"), the Mortgage-Backed Securities Division (a division of FICC), and others. With respect to its business in reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, substantially all open contracts as of September 30, 2024 are with the FICC . In addition, the Company clears its non-U.S. international equities business carried on by Oppenheimer Europe Ltd. through Global Prime Partners, Ltd, a global clearing financial institution located in the United Kingdom. The clearing organizations have the right to charge the Company for losses that result from a client's failure to fulfill its contractual obligations. Accordingly, the Company has credit exposures with these clearing brokers. The clearing brokers can re-hypothecate the securities held on behalf of the Company. As the right to charge the Company has no maximum amount and applies to all trades executed through the clearing brokers, the Company believes there is no maximum amount assignable to this right. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had recorded no liabilities with regard to this right. The Company's policy is to monitor the credit standing of the clearing brokers and banks with which it conducts business.

This estimated aggregate range is based upon currently available information for those legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, where the Company can make an estimate for such losses. For certain cases, the Company does not believe that it can make an estimate. The foregoing aggregate estimate is based on various factors, including the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that some are currently in preliminary stages), the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Company's estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more than the current estimate.

 In addition, in June and August of 2023, Oppenheimer was served with two Horizon-related complaints in Georgia State Court, by plaintiffs, virtually all of whom were never Oppenheimer customers, alleging unspecified losses.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 BACKGROUND 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Oppenheimer Holdings Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (together, the "Company", "Firm", "Parent", "we", "our" or "us"). The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. 
 
 Oppenheimer Holdings Inc., through its operating subsidiaries, is a leading middle market investment bank and full service broker-dealer that is engaged in a broad range of activities in the securities industry, including retail securities brokerage, institutional sales and trading, market-making, research, investment banking (both corporate and public finance), investment advisory and asset management services and trust services. Its principal subsidiaries are Oppenheimer Co. Inc. ("Oppenheimer") and Oppenheimer Asset Management Inc. ("OAM"). As of September 30, 2024, we provided our services from 89 offices in 25 states located throughout the United States and offices in Puerto Rico, Tel Aviv, Israel, Hong Kong, China, London, England, St. Helier, Isle of Jersey and Geneva, Switzerland. The Company provides investment advisory services through OAM and Oppenheimer Investment Management LLC ("OIM") and Oppenheimer's financial advisor directed programs. At September 30, 2024, client assets under management ("AUM") totaled 49.1 billion. AUM includes the total market value of client investments in discretionary and non-discretionary advisory programs as well as the net asset value of private placements of alternative investments offered by and held by clients of the Firm. Client assets under administration ("CAUA") as of September 30, 2024 totaled 129.8 billion. CAUA includes AUM and the other assets held for which the Firm provides services. We also provide trust services and products through Oppenheimer Trust Company of Delaware and limited discount brokerage services through Freedom Investments, Inc. ("Freedom"). Through OPY Credit Corp., we conduct our secondary trading activities related to the purchase and sale of loans, primarily on a riskless principal basis. At September 30, 2024, the Company employed 2,993 employees (2,951 full-time, 41 part-time and 1 intern), of whom 928 were financial advisors. 
 
 Outlook 
 We are focused on growing our private client and asset management businesses through strategic additions of experienced financial advisors in our existing branch system and employment of experienced money management personnel in our asset management business as well as deploying our capital for expansion through targeted acquisitions. We are increasingly creating and investing in private market opportunities on our own behalf and on behalf of qualified clients. We are also focused on opportunities in our capital market businesses, including integrating new technology platforms to expand the suite of services offered to our clients and onboarding experienced personnel and/or small units that will improve our ability to attract institutional clients in both equities and fixed income without significantly raising our risk profile. In investment banking, we are committed to growing our footprint by adding experienced bankers within our existing industry practices as well as new industry practices where we believe we can be successful. 
 
 We continuously invest in and improve our technology platform to support client service and to remain competitive, while continuously managing expenses. The Company's long-term growth plan is to continue to expand existing offices by hiring experienced professionals as well as expand through the purchase of operating branch offices from other broker-dealers or the opening of new branch offices in attractive locations, and to continue to grow and develop the existing trading, investment banking, investment advisory and other divisions. We recognize employee work habits have changed in a post-pandemic world. As a result, we are continuously reviewing our physical footprint on lease renewals, and in many cases reducing office size and configuration. We are committed to continuing to improve our capabilities to ensure compliance with industry regulations, support client service and expand our wealth management and capital markets capabilities. We recognize the importance of compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and are committed to performing rigorous and ongoing assessments of our compliance and risk management effort, and investing in people and programs, while providing a platform with first class investment programs and services. 
 The Company also reviews its full service business model to determine the opportunities available to build or acquire closely related businesses in areas where others have shown some success. Equally important is the search for viable acquisition candidates. Our long-term intention is to pursue growth by acquisition where we can find a comfortable match in terms of corporate goals and personnel at a price that would provide our shareholders with incremental value. We review potential acquisition opportunities from time to time with the aim of fulfilling the Company's strategic goals, while evaluating and managing our existing businesses. In addition, the Company may from time to time make an acquisition of 100 of a business or make minority private investments out of excess capital in allied or unrelated

 businesses with the goal of either syndicating the investment to eligible clients or retaining ownership because we believe them to be an attractive investment. 
 Impact of Change in Short-term Interest Rates 
 
 After holding the target federal funds rate steady for nearly 14 months, the Federal Reserve (the FED voted to cut rates by one half percent at its September 2024 meeting as their attention turned to addressing employment data, given the progress made on reducing underlying inflation in recent months. Projections of the federal funds rate released by the FED in September indicate that the FED expects rate decreases through the end of 2024, with further reductions in the coming year. 
 
 Potential decreases to the federal funds rate may impact our interest-based revenues. While decreases in interest rates will lower fees the Company earns from FDIC insured deposits of clients through a program offered by the Company, such decreases may be offset to a degree if the cash sweep balances increase as clients find fewer higher-yielding alternatives to deploy these balances. Future rate decreases will also reduce the rates the Company charges on customer margin loans, which will have a negative impact on our earnings. 
 
 Israel-Hamas War and Conflict with Hezbollah and Iran 
 
 On October 7, 2023, Hamas initiated an unprovoked invasion of Israel from the Gaza Strip, resulting in thousands of casualties. Israel formally declared war on Hamas in response to the attack and initiated several military operations in an effort to clear militants from the area. The war is now in its second year and has seen a significant escalation in a longstanding conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese-based militant group. The conflict was further intensified by the direct entry of Iran, which launched a missile attack on Israel. There remains a risk that these conflicts could expand into a wider regional war which could have an adverse impact on the worldwide economy, financial markets and thus on our business. At this time, these conflicts have not yet had a material impact on our business operations in Israel or elsewhere. 
 
 Impact of Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton 
 
 On September 26, 2024, Hurricane Helene ("Helene") made landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida and proceeded to cause widespread destruction across the southeastern United States for the next several days. The storm resulted in hundreds of fatalities and caused billions of dollars in property damages, leaving many communities isolated and without power for weeks. Helene was followed by Hurricane Milton ("Milton"), which caused widespread destruction across Florida. Early estimates of damage from Milton exceed 60 billion. While our offices in the impacted region remained closed throughout the storm, branch operations were largely unaffected given the back-up branch system we have in place as well as the ability of our key employees to work safely from a remote location. The hurricanes did not cause significant damage to our branches in the region, most of which have now fully reopened. Weather related incidents continue to increase and may cause disruptions to our normal business operations since they impact not only our employees, but also our clients. 
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 The Firm delivered strong operating results for the third quarter of 2024 in a still-resilient economic environment. During the third quarter of 2024, all major indices reached new highs, mostly spurred by the FED s long-awaited decision to reduce the federal funds rate by one half percent with the view that lower borrowing costs will slow the uptick in unemployment without rekindling higher inflation. Based on recent economic indicators, it appears that the U.S. economy is headed for a soft landing, amidst continued growth in the economy as we move into 2025. 
 
 The continued outperformance of the equity markets aided our Wealth Management franchise by driving better than expected retail trading volumes and related commission revenues during what is typically a seasonally slower summer trading period. The markets also propelled our AUM to our third consecutive record, resulting in higher asset-based advisory fees. Additionally, higher average margin loans drove a meaningful improvement in our interest revenues from the prior year, though our interest sensitive sweep income was somewhat reduced due to lower average sweep balances. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 Our investment banking revenues also rose due to an uptick in our advisory fees, particularly in our restructuring practice. Equity underwriting fees were adversely impacted by lower issuance levels as we have seen economic uncertainty restrict issuances despite the general improvement in market breadth and market averages. We believe that that Firm is well positioned to benefit as issuance volumes improve. 
 
 Our results drove yet another fresh record in our book value per share levels and provided us with the opportunity to further strengthen our balance sheet as we announced our plans to redeem all outstanding senior secured notes 113.05 million) at their par amounts, and we retired the Notes on October 10, 2024. Access to capital for expansion will continue to be available as needed. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The Company reported net income of 24.5 million or 2.38 basic earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024, compared with net income of 13.9 million or 1.32 per share for the third quarter of 2023. Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was 373.4 million, an increase of 19.4 , compared to revenue of 312.7 million for the third quarter of 2023.

 Highlights 
 Increased revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by significantly higher advisory fees attributable to a rise in billable AUM, an increase in transaction-based commissions as well as improved investment banking and interest revenues. 
 Announced plans to further strengthen balance sheet through the redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes which occurred on October 10, 2024. 
 Assets under administration and under management were both at record levels at September 30, 2024, benefiting from market appreciation. 
 Compensation expenses increased from the prior year quarter largely as a result of higher incentive compensation expenses, deferred compensation and production-related expenses. 
 Non-compensation expenses increased from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher interest and technology related expenses partially offset by lower legal costs. 
 Total stockholders' equity, book value and tangible book value per share reached new record highs as a result of positive earnings.

 Private Client 
 
 Private Client reported revenue for the current quarter of 218.8 million, 13.2 higher compared with a year ago mostly due to higher advisory fees driven by appreciation in AUM and an increase in commission revenue due to higher transactional volume. Pre-tax income of 62.9 million in the current quarter resulted in a pre-tax margin of 28.8 . Financial advisor headcount at the end of the current quarter was 928 compared to 946 at the end of the third quarter of 2023. We saw improved adviser productivity throughout the period.

 Bank deposit sweep income decreased 7.4 million from a year ago due to lower cash sweep balances. 
 Interest revenue increased 14.5 from the prior year period due to higher interest earned from margin loans. 
 Other revenue increased from a year ago primarily due to increases in the cash surrender value of Company-owned life insurance policies, which fluctuates based on changes in the fair value of the policies' underlying investments. 
 Compensation expenses increased 28.5 from a year ago primarily due to higher production related expenses and deferred compensation costs. 
 Non-compensation expenses increased 4.5 from a year ago primarily due to higher interest expense.

 Advisory fee revenue increased 8.9 from a year ago due to increased management fees resulting from the higher net value of billable AUM during the current quarter. 
 AUM increased to 49.1 billion at September 30, 2024, the third consecutive record high, which is the basis for advisory fee billings for October 2024. 
 The increase in AUM was comprised of higher asset values of 9.4 billion on existing client holdings, partially offset by payments of 0.7 billion. 
 Compensation expenses were up 18.1 from a year ago primarily resulting from increases in incentive compensation. 
 Non-compensation expenses were up 12.2 when compared to the prior year period mostly due to higher external portfolio management costs which are directly related to the increase in AUM.

 Fixed income underwriting fees were modestly higher than the prior year period. 
 Equities sales and trading revenue increase 7.5 compared with the prior year period mostly due to higher volumes. 
 Fixed income sales and trading revenue increased 45.5 compared with a year ago primarily due to an increase in trading income attributable to higher interest rates and volumes. 
 Compensation expenses increased 20.2 compared with a year ago largely due to costs associated with opportunistic new hires and higher incentive compensation. 
 Non-compensation expenses were 15.3 higher than a year ago primarily due to an increase in interest expense in financing trading inventories.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Reference is also made to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto found in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The Company's accounting policies are essential to understanding and interpreting the financial results reported on the condensed consolidated financial statements. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements are summarized in note 2 to those statements and the notes thereto found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain of those policies are considered to be particularly important to the presentation of the Company's financial results because they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to matters discussed under the heading "Critical Accounting Polices" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 At September 30, 2024, total assets increased by 17.1 from December 31, 2023. The Company satisfies its need for short-term financing from internally generated funds and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings, consisting primarily of bank call loans, stock loans, and uncommitted lines of credit. We finance our trading in government securities through the use of securities sold under repurchase agreements. Oppenheimer has arrangements with banks for borrowings on a fully collateralized basis. The amount of Oppenheimer's bank borrowings fluctuates in response to changes in the level of the Company's securities inventories and customer margin debt, changes in notes receivable from employees, investment in furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements, and changes in stock loan balances and financing through repurchase agreements. At September 30, 2024, the Company had bank call loans of 206.7 million compared to zero at December 31, 2023. The Company also has some availability of short-term bank financing on an unsecured basis. 
 
 The Company's overseas subsidiaries, Oppenheimer Europe Ltd. and Oppenheimer Investments Asia Limited, are subject to local regulatory capital requirements that restrict our ability to utilize their capital for other purposes. 
 
 The regulatory capital requirements for Oppenheimer Europe Ltd. and Oppenheimer Investments Asia Limited were 6.1 million and 386,133, respectively, at September 30, 2024. The liquid assets at Oppenheimer Europe Ltd. are primarily comprised of cash deposits in bank accounts. 
 
 The liquid assets at Oppenheimer Investments Asia Limited are primarily comprised of investments in U.S. Treasuries and cash deposits in bank accounts. Any transfer of these liquid assets from Oppenheimer Europe Ltd. and Oppenheimer Investments Asia Limited to the Company or its other subsidiaries would be limited by regulatory capital requirements. 
 
 The Company permanently reinvests eligible earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and, accordingly, does not accrue any U.S. income taxes that would arise if these earnings were repatriated. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with the outside basis difference of its foreign subsidiaries is estimated at 3.4 million for those subsidiaries. We have continued to reinvest permanently the excess earnings of Oppenheimer Israel (OPCO) Ltd. in its own business and in the businesses in Europe and Asia to support business initiatives in those regions. We will continue to review our historical treatment of these earnings to determine whether our historical practice will continue or whether a change is warranted. 
 Senior Secured Notes 
 At September 30, 2024 the Company had 113.05 million outstanding in 5.50 Senior Secured Notes due in 2025 (the Notes ). On September 19, 2024, the Company issued a notice of redemption to the holders of its Notes stating that it intends to redeem all of the 113.05 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding on October 10, 2024. The redemption price is equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. All of the Notes were redeemed on October 10, 2024 and none remain outstanding.

 As of September 30, 2024, S P s Corporate Family rating and rating on the Notes was a 'BB-' with a stable outlook. Moody s Corporate Family rating and the rating on the Notes was a Ba3 with a stable outlook. Subsequent to our redemption of the Notes on October 10, 2024, at the Company's request, both S P and Moody 's withdrew the above mentioned ratings. 
 
 Liquidity 
 For the most part, the Company's assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and assets that it can readily convert into cash. The receivable from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations represents deposits for securities borrowed transactions, margin deposits and current transactions awaiting settlement. The receivable from customers represents margin balances and amounts due on transactions awaiting settlement. Our receivables are, for the most part, collateralized by marketable securities. Our collateral maintenance policies and procedures are designed to limit our exposure to credit risk. Securities owned are mainly comprised of actively traded readily marketable securities. We issued 1.8 million in forgivable notes (which are inherently illiquid) to employees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023) as upfront or backend inducements to commence or continue employment as the case may be. The amount of funds allocated to such inducements will vary with hiring activity. 
 We satisfy our need for short-term liquidity from internally generated funds, collateralized and uncollateralized bank borrowings, stock loans and repurchase agreements. Bank borrowings are, in most cases, collateralized by Firm and customer securities. 
 
 We obtain short-term borrowings primarily through bank call loans. Bank call loans are generally payable on demand and bear interest at various rates. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 206.7 million of bank call loans (zero at December 31, 2023). The average daily bank loan outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 235.0 million and 147.5 million, respectively 43.8 million and 59.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023). The largest daily bank loans outstanding for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 346.9 million 112.2 million and 167.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively). 
 
 At September 30, 2024, securities loan balances totaled 272.0 million 285.0 million at December 31, 2023 and 292.9 million at September 30, 2023). The average daily securities loan balances outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 299.6 million and 296.6 million, respectively 314.3 million and 339.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively). The largest daily stock loan balance for both of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 375.5 million 359.0 million and 391.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively).

We finance our government trading operations through the use of securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements. Except as described below, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, primarily involving government and agency securities, are carried at amounts at which securities subsequently will be resold or reacquired as specified in the respective agreements and include accrued interest. 
 
 Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis, when the repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are executed with the same counterparty, have the same explicit settlement date, are executed in accordance with a master netting arrangement, the securities underlying the repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements exist in "book entry" form and certain other requirements are met. 
 At September 30, 2024, the gross balances of reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements were 244.4 million and 1,009.5 million, respectively. The average daily balance of reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements on a gross basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 233.0 million and 915.8 million, respectively 48.2 million and 720.8 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023). The largest amount of reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements outstanding on a gross basis during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 569.1 million and 1,035.9 million, respectively 227.1 million and 801.2 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023). 
 Liquidity Management 
 We manage our liquidity to meet our current obligations and upcoming liquidity needs as well as to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Our liquidity needs may be affected by market conditions, increased inventory positions, business expansion and other unanticipated occurrences. In the event that existing financial resources do not satisfy our liquidity needs, we may have to seek additional external financing. The availability of such additional external financing may depend on market factors outside our control. 
 
 We have Company-owned life insurance policies which are utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Certain policies which could provide additional liquidity if needed had a cash surrender value of 98.1 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We regularly review our sources of liquidity and financing and conduct internal stress analyses to determine the impact on the Company of events that could remove sources of liquidity or financing and to plan actions the Company could take in the case of such an eventuality. Regulators are increasingly focused on liquidity management and we have seen increased regulatory scrutiny of liquidity management by our industry. Should a disruption occur in our liquidity and financing sources, we have plans that we believe would result in a reduction of assets through liquidation that would significantly reduce the Company's need for external financing. 
 
 Our primary long-term cash requirements related to 167.4 million of operating lease obligations. The total cash requirement for interest expense related to operating lease obligations is estimated to be 3.0 million for the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Funding Risk 
 (Expressed in thousands) For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash used in operating activities (182,880) (84,226) Cash used in investing activities 455 (10,309) Cash provided by financing activities 185,832 13,290 Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 3,407 (81,245) 
 
 Management believes that funds from operations, combined with our capital base and available credit facilities, are sufficient for our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. Under some circumstances, banks including those on whom we rely may back away from providing funding to the securities industry. Such a development might impact our ability to finance our day-to-day activities or increase the costs to acquire funding. We may or may not be able to pass such increased funding costs on to our clients.

During periods of high volatility, we have seen increased calls for deposits of collateral to offset perceived risk between the Company's settlement liability to industry clearinghouses such as the Options Clearing Corporation OCC and National Securities Clearing Corp. NSCC as well as more stringent collateral arrangements with our bank lenders. The recent reduction of the settlement cycle for security transactions in the U.S. have substantially reduced settlement risks. All such requirements have been and will be met in the ordinary course with available collateral. 
 CYBERSECURITY 
 
 Cybersecurity presents significant challenges to the business community in general, including to the financial services industry. Increasingly, bad actors, both domestic and international, attempt to steal personal data and/or interrupt the normal functioning of businesses through accessing individuals' and companies' files and equipment connected to the internet. Recent incidents have reflected the increasing sophistication of intruders and their intent to steal personally identifiable information as well as funds and securities. These intruders sometimes use instructions that are seemingly from authorized parties but in fact, are from parties intent on attempting to steal. In other instances, these intruders attempt to bypass normal safeguards and disrupt or steal significant amounts of information and then either release it to the Internet or hold it for ransom. Regulators are increasingly requiring companies to provide heightened levels of sophisticated defenses. The Company maintains processes and systems with an aim to preventing any such attack from disrupting its services to clients as well as to prevent any loss of data concerning its clients, and their financial affairs, as well as Company privileged information. 
 
 Our management is actively involved in the oversight of our cybersecurity risk management program. We have devoted significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures to meet regulatory requirements and customer expectations. We have incorporated cybersecurity processes to assess, identify and manage risks from cybersecurity threats into our overall risk assessment process. The Company maintains a cybersecurity program that is designed to identify, protect from, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity threats and risks, and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems, including the information residing on such systems. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework helps the Company inform its cybersecurity agenda and prioritize its cybersecurity activities. The Company takes a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, which begins with the identification and evaluation of cybersecurity risks or threats that could affect the Company s operations, finances, legal or regulatory compliance, or reputation. The Company has processes in place for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats along with risk assessment procedures designed to allow such processes to remain responsive to emerging risks. Our processes include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
 we engage third-party cybersecurity firms and tools to assist with network monitoring, endpoint protection, vulnerability assessments and penetration testing; 
 we engage cyber security consultants, auditors, and other third parties to assess and enhance our cybersecurity practices, such as to perform tabletop exercises and evaluate our cyber processes including an assessment of our incident response procedures. Identified risks are formally tracked until mitigated or eliminated; 
 we perform regular scanning of our systems to identify and resolve critical vulnerabilities; 
 we provide periodic training and testing, including phishing tests, to help our employees understand cybersecurity risks and their responsibility in mitigating those risks; and 
 we insure against potential losses from cyber incidents by maintaining cybersecurity insurance. 
 
 We have a written incident response plan that identifies the steps to be taken in response to a cybersecurity incident that includes investigation, escalation and remediation provisions. The incident response plan includes standard processes for reporting and escalating cybersecurity incidents to senior management. 
 
 We have processes to evaluate third party service providers and vendors that have access to sensitive systems and Company and customer data, which may include the use of cybersecurity questionnaires and due diligence procedures such as assessments of that service provider s cybersecurity posture.

 Management s Role 
 
 Management has implemented risk management structures, policies and procedures, and manages our risk exposure on a day-to-day basis. The Company has a dedicated cybersecurity organization within its technology department that focuses on current and emerging cybersecurity matters. The Company s cybersecurity function is led by the Company s Chief Information Officer ("CIO"), and the Company s Chief Information Security Officer ("CISO"), who reports to the Company s CIO. The CIO and his direct reports, including the CISO, discuss action items related to risks at a standing monthly meeting. The CISO and many members of his team have multiple decades of cybersecurity-related experience. Risk reporting is provided at monthly meetings of the Firm s cross-business Cybersecurity Committee and periodic presentations to the Firm s Risk Management Committee, at which many members of the Company s senior management are present. 
 
 The CEO meets regularly with the CIO to discuss cybersecurity threats and existing and potentially new technology systems including those related to cybersecurity. The CIO and CISO have a standing monthly meeting with the President and General Counsel to discuss potential vulnerabilities in the cyber environment. The President formerly ran the Information Technology Department at the Firm and as a result has significant systems experience including experience related to cybersecurity. 
 
 Board Oversight 
 
 The Board of Directors, both directly and through the Audit Committee, oversees management s responsibility of ensuring proper functioning of our cybersecurity risk management program. In particular, the Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of management s responsibility to assess, manage and mitigate cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee receives a cybersecurity update at each regular meeting of the Board covering cybersecurity risks, cybersecurity staffing and staff development including certifications and training. These updates are given either in person by the CIO and CISO or in written presentations created by them. 
 
 Like other U.S. broker dealers, in May 2024 the Company began submitting client personal information to the Consolidated Audit Trail National Market System. The CAT NMS is the world s largest repository of securities transactions and client information and as a result, presents a significant cybersecurity threat to customer personally identifiable information. 
 
 As of the date of this filing, the Company has not identified any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably anticipated to have a material effect on the Company s business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. Although the Company has not experienced cybersecurity incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, the Company has experienced cyberattacks in the past, which the Company believes have thus far been mitigated by preventative, detective, and responsive measures put in place by the Company. Given the continuing reports of cyber incidents in general, we believe that the Company will most likely continue to be a target of cybersecurity attacks by bad actors. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to prevent any or all such attacks. 
 
 REGULATORY MATTERS AND DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 Regulation Best Interest (U.S.) 
 On June 5, 2019, the SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest Reg BI as Rule 151-1 under the Exchange Act. Reg BI imposes a federal standard of conduct on registered broker-dealers and their associated persons when dealing with retail clients and requires that a broker-dealer and its representatives act in the best interest of clients and not place its own interests ahead of the customer s interests. Reg BI does not define the term best interest but instead sets forth four distinct obligations disclosure, care, conflict of interest and compliance that a broker-dealer must satisfy in each transaction. Required compliance with Reg BI became effective on June 30, 2020. In addition to adopting Reg BI, the SEC adopted rules (i) requiring broker-dealers and investment advisers to provide a written relationship summary to each client, and (ii) clarifying certain interpretations under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 including but not limited to when a broker-dealer's activity is considered solely incidental to its broker-dealer business and is, therefore, not considered investment advisory activity (collectively, the Reg BI Rules ).

 Reg BI requires enhanced documentation for recommendations of securities transactions to broker-dealer retail clients as well as the cessation of certain practices and limitations on certain kinds of transactions previously conducted in the normal course of business. The rules and processes required under Reg BI limit revenue and involve increased costs, including, but not limited to, compliance costs associated with enhanced technology as well as increased litigation risks. The Company made significant structural, technological and operational changes to our business practices to comply with the requirements of the Reg BI Rules and it is likely that additional changes may be necessary to continue to comply as more experience with the Reg BI Rules is gained. Regulators have commenced in-depth reviews of the industry s compliance with the requirements of Reg BI, including that of the Company. 
 On December 18, 2020, the Department of Labor ("DOL") published its final prohibited transaction exemption PTE addressing investment advice for fiduciaries of ERISA plans and IRAs. Similar to the proposal the DOL released in June of 2020, the final exemption takes a principles-based (rather than a prescriptive) approach to resolving conflicts that arise under ERISA when an investment advice fiduciary, its affiliate or a related party is paid certain types of compensation (such as commissions, trailing fees or revenue-sharing) or engages in certain principal transactions. The final exemption should provide a new and more flexible approach to ERISA compliance for certain types of transactions, which financial institutions may choose to utilize in place of other existing exemptions. Like the proposal (but in contrast to the precursor rule the DOL finalized in April 2016 that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit later vacated in June 2018), the final exemption does not materially change the scope of fiduciary activities under ERISA, with the exception of including certain rollover-related advice as fiduciary advice. The effective date for compliance with the PTE was February 1, 2022. The Company believes many of the steps taken by the Company to achieve compliance with the Reg BI Rules have enabled and will enable the Company to comply with the PTE. The Company implemented certain additional processes to accompany the actions taken to comply with the Reg BI Rules in order to ensure full compliance with the PTE. 
 On April 25, 2024, the DOL finalized a collection of regulatory changes in its ongoing quest to update the definition of a fiduciary under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code (the 2024 Fiduciary Rule ). In finalizing the 2024 Fiduciary Rule, the DOL sought to confer ERISA fiduciary status on professional investment advisers and wealth managers, particularly with regard to participant-directed 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts. Along with the 2024 Fiduciary Rule, the DOL published amendments to a collection of prohibited transaction exemptions. The 2024 Fiduciary Rule was set to become effective on September 23, 2024. 
 
 On July 25 and 26, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, respectively, issued stays on the effective date of the fiduciary rulemaking package. Both courts found that the challenges to the rulemaking package were likely to succeed on the merits because the rulemaking exceeds the DOL s authority and is not consistent with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit s decision in Chamber of Commerce v. U.S. Department of Labor, (5th Cir. 2018), which vacated the DOL s 2016 fiduciary rulemaking. 
 
 Regulatory Environment 
 See the discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the impact on our operations of certain rules and regulations in Item 1 Business - Regulation in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information. 
 Oppenheimer and many of its affiliates are each subject to various regulatory capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, all of our active regulated domestic and international subsidiaries had net capital in excess of minimum requirements. See note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for further information on regulatory capital requirements.

 FACTORS AFFECTING "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS" 
 From time to time, the Company may publish or make oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 which provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may relate to such matters as anticipated financial performance, future revenues, earnings, liabilities or expenses, business prospects, projected ventures, new products, anticipated market performance, and similar matters. The Company cautions readers that a variety of factors could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the Company s forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company s control, include, but are not limited to: (i) transaction volume in the securities markets, (ii) the volatility of the securities markets, (iii) fluctuations in interest rates, (iv) changes in regulatory requirements that could affect the cost and method of doing business, (v) general economic conditions, both domestic and international, including inflation, recession, and changes in consumer confidence and spending, (vi) competition from existing financial institutions, new entrants and other participants in the securities markets and financial services industry, (vii) potential cybersecurity threats and attacks, (viii) legal developments affecting the litigation experience of the securities industry and the Company, (ix) changes in foreign, federal and state tax laws that could affect the popularity of products sold by the Company or impose taxes on securities transactions, (x) 
 the adoption and implementation of the SEC s Regulation Best Interest and other regulations adopted in recent years, (xi) war, terrorist acts and nuclear confrontation as well as political unrest, including events relating to the Israel-Hamas war, the conflict with Hezbollah and Iran and related unrest in the Middle East and Russia's invasion of Ukraine and related Western sanctions, (xii) the Company s ability to achieve its business plan, (xiii) the effects of the economy on the Company s ability to find and maintain financing options and liquidity, (xiv) credit, operational, legal and regulatory risks, (xv) risks related to foreign operations, (xvi) the effect of technological innovation on the financial services industry and securities business, (xvii) risks related to election results, Congressional gridlock, political and social unrest, government shutdowns and investigations, trade wars, bank failures, changes in or uncertainty surrounding regulation, and the potential for default by the U.S. government on the nation's debt, (xviii) risks related to changes in capital requirements under international standards that may cause banks to back away from providing funding to the securities industry and (xix) economic, market, political and social impact of, and uncertainty relating to, any catastrophic events, including pandemics, epidemics or other outbreaks of disease, climate-related risks such as natural disasters and extreme weather events. There can be no assurance that the Company has correctly or completely identified and assessed all of the factors affecting the Company's business. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a 15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures or its internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or omission. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 The Company confirms that its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in its reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Many aspects of the Company's business involve substantial risks of liability. In the normal course of business, the Company has been named as defendant or co-defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, creating substantial exposure and periodic expenses. Certain of the actual or threatened legal matters include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. These proceedings arise primarily from securities brokerage, asset management and investment banking activities. The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Company's business, which may result in expenses, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. The investigations include inquiries from the SEC, FINRA and other regulators. 
 
 The Company accrues for estimated loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory matters within Other Expenses in the consolidated income statement when available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred and the Company can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss. In many proceedings, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is often not possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss or possible additional losses or range of additional losses. 
 
 For certain legal and regulatory proceedings, the Company cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek substantial, indeterminate or special damages. Counsel may be required to review, analyze and resolve numerous issues, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings in question, before the Company can reasonably estimate a loss or range of loss or additional loss for the proceeding. Even after lengthy review and analysis, the Company, in many legal and regulatory proceedings, may not be able to reasonably estimate possible losses or range of losses. 
 For certain other legal and regulatory proceedings, the Company can estimate possible losses, or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses individually, or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a whole. 
 
 For legal and regulatory proceedings where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred, the Company estimates a range of aggregate loss in excess of amounts accrued of up to 5 million. This estimated aggregate range is based upon currently available information for those legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, where the Company can make an estimate for such losses. For certain cases, the Company does not believe that it can make an estimate. The foregoing aggregate estimate is based on various factors, including the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that some are currently in preliminary stages), the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Company's estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more than the current estimate. 
 
 Beginning on or about August 31, 2021, Oppenheimer was named as a respondent in numerous arbitrations, many containing multiple claimants, each filed before FINRA, relating to those claimants purported investment in Horizon Private Equity, III, LLC Horizon ). Horizon is alleged to be a fraudulent scheme involving, among others, a former Oppenheimer employee, John Woods. John Woods left Oppenheimer s employ in 2016 and Oppenheimer never received a complaint from any of the investors prior to the SEC bringing a complaint against Woods and his co-conspirators in 2021. Oppenheimer has settled or an award has been rendered and paid in all the Horizon-related arbitrations except for two arbitrations which allege losses of approximately 2.75 million in the aggregate. 
 
 In addition, in June and August of 2023, Oppenheimer was served with two Horizon-related complaints in Georgia State Court, by plaintiffs, virtually all of whom were never Oppenheimer customers, alleging unspecified losses. In 2024, each of those complaints was dismissed by the trial court. Plaintiffs in each case subsequently filed an appeal of the court s order dismissing the cases, each of which is currently pending.

Table of Contents 

On June 30, 2022, Oppenheimer received a "Wells Notice" from the SEC requesting that Oppenheimer make a written submission to the SEC to explain why Oppenheimer should not be charged with violations of Section 15c2-12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 15c2-12 thereunder as well as Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rules G-17 and G-27 in relation to its sales of municipal notes pursuant to an exemption from continuing disclosure contained in Rule 15c2-12. On September 13, 2022, the SEC filed a complaint against Oppenheimer in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Court") alleging that Oppenheimer violated Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15c2-12 thereunder as well as Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rules. The SEC asked the Court to enter an order enjoining Oppenheimer from violating the above-referenced rules and requiring disgorgement and payment of a civil penalty. On January 30, 2024, Oppenheimer and the SEC reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation pursuant to which Oppenheimer would pay a civil penalty of 1.2 million. The settlement is subject to Oppenheimer obtaining a waiver of certain statutory disqualifications.
