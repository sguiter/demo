MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to the operations and financial condition reported in the unaudited condensed financial statements of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and related notes included in this report. Except for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion, as well as other information in this report, contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections. Actual results and the timing of the events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the Forward-Looking Statements set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview Yong Bai Chao New Retail Corporation f/k/a Environmental Control Corp. we, us, the Company or like terms) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 17, 2004 under the name Boss Minerals, Inc. to pursue the exploration and development of mining claims located in British Columbia, Canada. During the quarter ended June 30, 2004, the Company filed a registration statement on Form SB-2 with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC to register shares of common stock for public resale by certain stockholders identified in the registration statement. Upon the effective date of the registration statement, the Company became subject to the reporting requirements of Section 12(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and commenced filing reports under the Exchange Act through the quarter ended June 30, 2012. In March 2006, the Company acquired the assets of Environmental Control Corporation, which developed vehicle emission control devices and filed a certificate of amendment to its articles of incorporation in April 2013 to change its name to Environmental Control Corp. The Company filed reports under the Exchange Act through the quarter ended June 30, 2012. On May 2, 2016, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada entered an order appointing Bryan Glass as custodian of the Company, authorizing and directing him to, among other things, take any action reasonable, prudent and for the benefit of the Company, including reinstating the Company under Nevada law, appointing officers, and convening an annual meeting of stockholders (the Order ). Mr. Glass was a shareholder of the Company on the date that he applied to serve as a custodian of the Company. From time to time, Mr. Glass submits applications to the courts of the state of Nevada to be appointed as the custodian of corporations in which he already is a shareholder that have forfeited their right to exist as a corporation for reasons such as failure to file annual reports or to pay required fees, and such applications may or may not be successful. If the court approves the application, Mr. Glass is appointed to serve as the custodian of such corporations. In the past, he either has contributed assets or sold them to third parties. Thereafter, the board of directors and Mr. Glass, in his role as custodian, appointed himself to serve as the President of the Company. On May 5, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Reinstatement with the state of Nevada to reestablish the Company s existence. On May 9, 2016, the board of directors and Bryan Glass, in the exercise of his power as the court-appointed custodian of the Company, appointed Bryan Glass as our President, Secretary and Treasurer and authorized the issuance of 60,000,000 shares of stock to Mr. Glass for an aggregate price of 60,000, which sum was paid by the performance of services to the Company and the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Glass on the Company s behalf in the amount of 6,685. The expenses incurred by Mr. Glass included 5,160 to the state of Nevada for fees in connection with reinstating the Company and other filings to bring the Company current under the requirements of Nevada corporate law; 1,250 to the transfer agent for outstanding fees; and 275 to the state of Nevada as a filing fee in connection with the amendment to the articles of incorporation. 10 Table of Contents On June 15, 2016, the Company held a stockholders meeting at which the stockholders adopted Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company under which the Company increased the total number of shares it is authorized to issue to 190 million shares consisting of 180 million shares of common stock and 10 million shares of blank check preferred stock. In December 2018, Mr. Glass sold 60 million shares of common stock, representing all of the shares he owned in the Company, and equal to 56.83 of the total number of outstanding shares of the Company s common stock, to Lili Xin for the sum of 90,000. Ms. Chang became acquainted with Mr. Glass through a mutual associate, and they subsequently negotiated a deal for his control of a block of shares in the Company. Concurrent with the sale of his shares, the board of directors appointed Ms. Chang as the President and as a director of the Company and Mr. Glass resigned from all positions he held with the Company. On May 22, 2019, the Company filed a Form 15 with the SEC terminating the registration of its class of common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and its duty to file periodic and other reports with the SEC. On December 12, 2019, the Company filed a registration statement on Form 10 to register its class of common stock under the Exchange Act, and the registration statement automatically became effective in February 2020. On June 29, 2021, Lili Xin, our former Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, director and principal stockholder of the Company Ms. Xin ), and Fei Wang Mr. Wang ), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which Ms. Xin agreed to sell to Mr. Wang 80,000,000 shares of Common Stock registered in her name (the Shares ), representing 59 of the outstanding shares of common stock in the Company, at a purchase price of Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars 350,000). The seller relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated under the Act in selling the Company s securities to Mr. Wang. The funds came from the personal funds of Mr. Wang and was not the result of a loan. The closing occurred on August 10, 2021. In connection with such sale, Lili Xin, the then CEO, President and CFO resigned from all of her positions associated with the Company. Concurrently therewith, Mr. Wang was appointed to serve as the sole executive officer and director of the Company. Effective October 28, 2021, the Company s name changed to Yong Bai Chao New Retail Corporation. On May 17, 2023, the Company obtained the approval of the holders of a majority of the Company s issued and outstanding shares that approved and adopted the amended and restated articles of incorporation (the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation ), to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of the Company s outstanding common stock (the Reverse Stock Split ). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each 20 shares of common stock (the Old Shares will become and be consolidated into one share of common stock (the New Shares ), with stockholders who would receive a fractional share to receive a whole number of one share. Accordingly, the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding will decrease from 189,120,068 to approximately 9,456,004. Since additional fractional shares may be issued in order to round up fractional shares, we currently do not know the exact number of New Shares that will be outstanding after the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split will become effective upon the filing of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation have not been filed with the Secretary of the State of Nevada so the Reverse Stock Split has not been put into effect. On January 9, 2024, Min Zhang resigned as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, effective on January 9, 2024. Mr. Zhang did not advise the Company of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operation, policies, or practices. On January 9, 2024, Jianbao Huang resigned as Secretary of the Board of Directors position of the Company, effective on January 9, 2024. Mr. Huang did not advise the Company of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operation, policies, or practices. 11 Table of Contents On January 9, 2024, Yanying Feng, Zhenpeng Lu and Li Yang resigned as Directors of the Board of the Company, effective on January 9, 2024. Mr. Zhenpeng Lu, Ms. Li Yang and Ms. Yanying Feng did not advise the Company of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operation, policies, or practices. On February 28, 2024, Wang Fei ("Mr. Wang") resigned as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of the Company Mr. Wang did not advise the Company of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operation, policies, or practices. Concurrently therewith, Baobin He was appointed to serve as the sole executive officer and director of the Company. On September 25, 2024, Daohong Yuan was appointed as the new Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and Ye Yuan was selected to be a Director of the Company. Concurrently therewith, Baobin He resigned as the sole executive officer and Director of the Company. Mr. He did not advise the Company of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operation, policies, or practices. The Company only possesses minimal liabilities with no substantial business operations. There was no revenue or positive cash flows from operating activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s management efforts are focused on seeking out a new and profitable operating business with strong growth potential. Unless and until the Company s successful acquisition of an operating business, we expect our expenses to primarily consist of accounting fee, legal service fee, and filing fee related to maintaining itself as a public company. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies. The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to these unaudited condensed financial statements. Currently, based on the Company s limited activity, we do not believe that there are any accounting policies that require the application of difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue We did not generate any revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses primarily consisted of fees and expenses related to complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements, which mainly consisted of accounting fee, legal service fee, and filing fee. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total operating expenses amounted to 7,653 as compared to 9,970 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2,317 or 23.24 . The decrease was primarily due to decreases in stock transfer agent fee of 2,150 and Edgar filing fees of 667, offset by increases in legal fee of 500. Net Loss As a result of the factors described above, we had a net loss of 7,653 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 9,970 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2,317 or 23.24 . 12 Table of Contents Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine months ended September 30, 2023 Revenue We did not generate any revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses primarily consisted of fees and expenses related to complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements, which mainly consisted of accounting fee, legal service fee, and filing fee. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total operating expenses amounted to 34,889 as compared to 53,767 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 18,878 or 35.11 . The decrease was primarily due to decreases in audit fees of 11,000, legal fees of 7,000, stock transfer agent fees of 1,080, and Edgar filing fees of 798, offset by increases in accounting fees of 1,000. Net Loss As a result of the factors described above, we had a net loss of 34,889 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 53,767 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 18,878 or 35.11 . L iquidity and Capital Resources On September 30, 2024, we did not have any cash, while, we had liabilities of 141,548 and had a working capital deficit of 141,548. Net cash flow used in operating activities was 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These included our net loss of 34,889, offset by the changes in operating assets and liabilities totaling 34,889. We are a shell company with no revenue generating activities. We anticipate that our operating activities will generate negative net cash flow during the remaining portion of 2024. The success of our business plan is dependent upon the availability of additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to management as we are not generating sufficient revenues from our business operations. Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions and stockholder advances. There can be no assurance that we can raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed above are adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months. We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares and shareholder advances in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our plan of operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that constitute off-balance sheet arrangements. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. This Item is not applicable because we are a smaller reporting company, as defined by applicable SEC regulation. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures . We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily were required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible changes or additions to our controls and procedures. As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, our management concluded that (i) there are material weaknesses in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting, that the weaknesses constitute a deficiency which could result in misstatements of the foregoing accounts and disclosures that could result in a material misstatement to the financial statements for the period covered by this report that would not be detected, and (ii) accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Subject to the foregoing disclosure, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 14 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm business. We are currently not a party to any lawsuit or proceeding which, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us or our business. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS This Item is not applicable because we are a smaller reporting company, as defined by applicable SEC regulations. ITEM 2.
