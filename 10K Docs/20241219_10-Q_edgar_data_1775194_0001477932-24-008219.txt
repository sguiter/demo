Approximately 3,170,000 of the decline was related to the discontinued recommerce business in other subsidiaries after the sale of E-core. Management has augmented the overall strategy of the Company to focus on product sales, including the development, production and distribution of branded products. In addition, sales were affected by the manufacturing consolidation to Florida, which was completed by August 1, 2024, with manufacturing returning to full production. Cost of revenue decreased by 1,418,754 or 50 compared with the same period last year. The cost of revenue decrease is directly related to the sales declines described above. Gross margin remained the same between the two periods with less than a 2 change. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 775,277 or 43 compared with the same period last year. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily related to the reduction of unnecessary agency expenses and a focused strategy on our core products. Distribution costs decreased by 676,167 or 32 compared with the same period last year. The decrease in distribution costs was primarily related to the overall decline in the recommerce revenue. Management will continue to reduce overall distribution costs with the consolidation of products and facilities. 29 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses decreased by 210,660 or 13 compared with the same period last year. Since the consolidation to Florida and other changes in the business, management has actively been reducing general and administrative costs. Management expects that general and administrative expenses to continue to decline, with the most significant declines being realized in periods ending after December 31, 2024. Other operating expenses decreased by 957,965 or 71 compared with the same period last year. The decrease in other operating expenses was primarily related to the change in amortization of acquired intangible assets and the decreased amortization of stock-based compensation. Other expenses, which is primarily interest decreased by 562,871 or 66 compared with the same period last year. The decrease in interest expense was primarily related to the elimination of the acquisition debt for E-core and the elimination of debt with the sale of VitaMedica in the prior year. A gain of 380,624 was recognized on the sale of Interactive offers and there was net income of 100,717 from discontinued operations. The Company had a net loss of 1,625,577 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 1,333,388 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the net loss is primarily related to the above-mentioned changes.

The increase in cash was primarily the sale of the building and the collection of the purchase price for E-core. Net cash from operating activities benefited from non-cash expenses of 402,964, which was offset by an approximate 400,000 increase in accounts receivable and inventory and approximately 500,000 in the reduction of several liabilities. The negative cash flow from operations was anticipated by management as the Company augmented the overall strategy of the Company to focus on product sales, including the development, production and distribution of branded products. 30 Table of Contents Net cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5,838,106 and 145,324, respectively.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023 the use of cash was for the scheduled repayment of debts. We estimate that we will have sufficient working capital to fund our operations over the twelve months following the date of the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements and meet all of our debt obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2023 (the Evaluation Date ). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. This conclusion is based on findings that constituted material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 31 Table of Contents In performing the above-referenced assessment, our management identified the following material weaknesses: (i) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (ii) lack of multiple levels of supervision and review. We believe the weaknesses and their related risks are not uncommon in a company of our size because of the limitations in the size and number of staff. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible. However, we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the appointment of additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and implement modifications to our financial controls to address such inadequacies, by the end of our 2024 fiscal year as resources allow. We are currently reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes in the current fiscal year, including identifying specific areas within our governance, accounting and financial reporting processes to add adequate resources to potentially mitigate these material weaknesses. Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 12a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has added significant qualified resources to ensure proper segregation of duties and proper review of the financial reporting policies and procedures. 32 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. The Company is not involved in any pending legal proceeding or litigation, and, to the best of its knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party or to which any of its properties is subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
