 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 concerning us and other matters. Words such as will, expect, anticipate, intend, may, could, should, plan, project, forecast, believe, estimate, outlook, trends, goals, contemplate, continue, might, possible, potential, predict, would and similar expressions, generally identify these forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements relating to our future financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows, and our projects and related timelines. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions, expectations, plans and projections that we believe to be reasonable when made, but which may change over time. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and inherently involve a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. 
 Redwire believes it is important to communicate its expectations to its security holders. However, there may be events in the future that Redwire s management is not able to predict accurately or over which Redwire has no control. The risk factors and cautionary language contained in this report, and other reports and documents filed by Redwire with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in such forward-looking statements, including among other things: 
 risks associated with economic uncertainty, including high inflation, supply chain challenges, labor shortages, high interest rates, foreign currency exchange volatility, concerns of economic slowdown or recession and reduced spending or suspension of investment in new or enhanced projects; 
 the failure of financial institutions or transactional counterparties could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations; 
 our limited operating history in an evolving industry and history of losses to date makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter; 
 if we are unable to successfully integrate recently completed and future acquisitions or successfully select, execute or integrate future acquisitions into the business, our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected; 
 our ability to grow our business depends on the successful development and continued refinement of many of our proprietary technologies, products, and service offerings; 
 competition with existing or new companies could cause downward pressure on prices, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities, and the loss of market share; 
 a limited number of customers make up a high percentage of our revenue; 
 matters relating to or arising from our Audit Committee investigation, including litigation matters and potential additional expenses, may adversely affect our business and results of operations; 
 natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, or other natural or man-made catastrophic events could disrupt and impact our business; 
 adverse publicity stemming from any incident involving Redwire or our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
 our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by insurance or indemnity; 
 our business could be seriously harmed if we fail to respond to commercial industry cycles in terms of our cost structure, manufacturing capacity, and/or personnel needs; 
 any delays in the development, design, engineering and manufacturing of our core offerings may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
 unsatisfactory performance of our core offerings resulting from challenges in the space environment, extreme space weather events or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
 our results of operations and cash flows are substantially affected by our mix of fixed-price, cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts; 
 our cash flow and profitability could be reduced if expenditures are incurred prior to the final receipt of a contract; 
 3 

Table of Contents 

 we may in the future invest significant resources in developing new offerings and exploring the application of our technologies for other uses and those opportunities may never materialize; 
 we may not be able to convert our orders in backlog into revenue; 
 we may use artificial intelligence in our business, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and adversely affect our results of operations; 
 our reliance on third-party launch vehicles to launch our spacecraft and customer payloads into space; 
 we may experience a total loss of our technology and products and our customers payloads, if there is an accident on launch or during the journey into space; 
 our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or any guidance that we may provide; 
 cyber-attacks and other security threats and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business; 
 if we are not successful in attracting or retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy; 
 our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations; 
 our net earnings could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill; 
 our pension funding and costs are dependent on several economic assumptions which, if changed, may cause our future results of operations and cash flows to fluctuate significantly over time; 
 our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited; 
 the U.S. government s budget deficit and the national debt, as well as any inability of the U.S. government to complete its budget process for any government fiscal year and consequently having to shut down or operate on funding levels equivalent to its prior fiscal year pursuant to a continuing resolution, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; 
 we depend significantly on U.S. government contracts, which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate termination, and heavily regulated and audited; 
 we are subject to the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual NISPOM for our facility security clearance, which is a prerequisite to our ability to perform on classified contracts for the U.S. government; 
 we are subject to stringent U.S. economic sanctions, and trade control laws and regulations; 
 if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or defend against intellectual property claims, our competitive position could be impaired and our intellectual property applications for registration may not be issued or be registered; 
 we may require substantial additional funding to finance our operations, but adequate additional financing may not be available when we need it, on acceptable terms or at all; 
 the reduced relative voting power of holders of our common stock and diluted the ownership of holders of our capital stock as a result of the issuance and sale of shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock; 
 AE Industrial Partners and Bain Capital have significant influence over us, which could limit other investors ability to influence the outcome of key transactions; 
 provisions in the Certificate of Designation related to our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party, which could also reduce the market price of our capital stock; 
 our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of holders of our other outstanding capital stock; 
 there may be sales of a substantial amount of our common stock by our current shareholders and these sales could cause the price of our common stock to fall; 
 the trading price of our common stock and warrants is and may continue to be volatile; and 
 if we were to identify additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies, or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results, in which case our business may be harmed and investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports.

Committed Equity Facility 
 On April 14, 2022, the Company entered into a common stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement with B. Riley Principal Capital, LLC B. Riley ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to direct B. Riley to purchase a specified amount of shares (each, a Purchase over the -month period from Commencement (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). Shares issued to B. Riley under the Purchase Agreement cannot exceed of the shares outstanding prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement. In addition, the number of shares eligible to be purchased by B. Riley in a single Purchase may not exceed the lesser of (i) of the Purchase Volume Reference Amount, defined as the total aggregate volume of the Company s shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE during ten consecutive trading days prior to the Purchase date divided by ten, and (ii) of the total number of the Company s shares traded on the NYSE during the intraday purchase period, which is determined by the trading day on which B. Riley receives a valid purchase notice from the Company. 
 
 Pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement entered into with B. Riley, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on April 22, 2022, as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to Form S-1 on Form S-3 filed on June 8, 2023, which registered an initial shares of common stock to permit the subsequent resale of shares purchased under the committed equity facility. 
 
 The Company controls the timing and amount of any sales to B. Riley, which depend on a variety of factors including, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of the Company s common stock, and determinations by the Company as to appropriate sources of funding for its business and operations. However, B. Riley s obligation to purchase shares is subject to certain conditions. In all instances, the Company may not sell shares of its common stock under the Purchase Agreement if it would result in B. Riley beneficially owning more than of its common stock at any one point in time. 
 
 At inception, the Company evaluated the Purchase Agreement with B. Riley and determined that the committed equity facility was not indexed to the Company s own common stock and, therefore, measures the derivative asset at fair value based on the consideration transferred to B. Riley in exchange for its irrevocable commitment to purchase up to million in shares of the Company s common stock. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative asset are dependent upon, among other things, changes in the closing share price of the Company s common stock, the quantity and purchase price of shares purchased by B. Riley during the reporting period, the unused capacity under the committed equity facility as of the balance sheet date and the cost of raising other forms of capital. As certain inputs are not observable in the market, the derivative asset is classified as a Level 3 instrument within the fair value hierarchy. The Company adjusts the previous fair value estimate of the committed equity facility at each reporting period based on changes in the weighted average purchase price of shares purchased by B. Riley during the period, the unused capacity available under the committed equity facility, expected stock price volatility and other macroeconomic factors which impact the cost of raising comparable forms of capital. On April 14, 2024, the Purchase Agreement with B. Riley expired in accordance with its terms and was not extended. As a result, the Company no longer recognized a derivative asset related to the committed equity facility after April 14, 2024. 
 
 Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the purchase price for each share of common stock is equal to of the volume weighted average price VWAP on the applicable purchase date, which results in a fee on the purchase of the Company s common stock. The Company did sell shares to B. Riley during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Private Warrants 
 In September 2021, the Company issued private warrants in a transaction exempt from registration under securities regulations. The warrants, which are not listed for trading on a stock exchange, entitle the holder to purchase share of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of per share, subject to adjustment. The warrants will expire on September 2, 2026, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The private warrants were established as a liability at issuance. Classification of the private warrants as liability instruments was based on an analysis of the guidance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and in a statement issued by the Staff of the SEC regarding the accounting and reporting considerations for warrants

On December 17, 2021, the Company, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Peter Cannito, and then current, but now former Chief Financial Officer, William Read, were named as defendants in a putative class action complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. That litigation is captioned Lemen v. Redwire Corp. et al., Case No. 3:21-cv-01254-TJC-PDB (M.D. Fla.). On March 7, 2022, the Court appointed a lead plaintiff. On June 17, 2022, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint. In the amended complaint, the lead plaintiff alleges that the Company and certain of its directors and officers made misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material facts about the Company s business, operations, and prospects, allegedly in violation of Section 10(b) (and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. As relief, the plaintiffs are seeking, among other things, compensatory damages. The defendants believe the allegations are without merit and intend to defend the suit vigorously. On August 16, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety, and such motion was denied by the Court on March 22, 2023. The Company has recognized a loss contingency of million as of September 30, 2024, which is its best estimate of probable loss and recovery based on the current circumstances. The loss contingency is included as other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 On May 25, 2022, a plaintiff commenced derivative litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on behalf of the Company against Peter Cannito, Les Daniels, Reggie Brothers, Joanne Isham, Kirk Konert, Jonathan Baliff, and John S. Bolton. That litigation is captioned Yingling v. Cannito, et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00684-MN (D. Del.). The complaint s allegations are similar to those of the class action lawsuit filed in December 2021, namely, that statements about Redwire s business and operations were misleading due to alleged material weaknesses in the Company s financial reporting internal controls. The plaintiff alleges the defendants violated Section 10(b) (and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, breached their fiduciary duty by allowing misleading disclosures to be made, and caused the Company to overpay compensation and bonuses tied to the Company s financial performance. As relief, the plaintiffs are seeking, among other things, compensatory and punitive damages. This litigation has been stayed until the earlier of: (i) fifteen ) days following the issuance of a decision resolving a motion for summary judgment in or public disclosure of a potential settlement of the class action lawsuit filed on December 17, 2021, or (ii) twenty ) days following notice by either party of another pending derivative action and where the continuance of such stay may or will prejudice the noticing party s rights. The defendants believe the allegations are without merit and intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously. The Company is currently unable to predict the likely outcome of the proceedings or estimate the range of reasonably possible losses, which may be material. However, the amount of any reasonable possible loss or range of loss is expected to be recoverable through the Company s D O insurance policy. 
 Business Combinations 
 The Company has acquired and plans to continue to acquire businesses with prior operating histories. These acquisitions may have unknown or contingent liabilities, which the Company may become responsible for and could have a material impact on the Company s future operating results and cash flows. In addition, the Company may incur acquisition costs, regardless of whether or not the acquisition is ultimately completed, which may be material to future periods.

 The increase in contract liabilities during 2024 was primarily driven by the timing of large billable milestones occurring during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was included in the contract liability balance as of December 31, 2023 was million.

 The Company evaluates the contract value and cost estimates at completion EAC for performance obligations at least quarterly and more frequently when circumstances significantly change. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company s performance obligations, the estimate of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract-by-contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, labor productivity, the nature and technical complexity of the work to be performed, availability and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and vendor performance, volume assumptions, inflationary trends, and schedule and performance delays. 
 
 When the Company s estimate of total costs to be incurred to satisfy a performance obligation exceeds the expected revenue, the Company recognizes the loss immediately. When the Company determines that a change in estimate has an impact on the associated profit of a performance obligation, the Company records the cumulative positive or negative adjustment to the statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Changes in estimates and assumptions related to the status of certain long-term contracts may have a material effect on the Company s operating results.

 Basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Net income (loss) available to common shareholders (the numerator) is calculated by deducting both dividends declared and accumulated, regardless of the form of payment, during the period from Net income (loss) attributable to Redwire Corporation as presented on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding for the periods presented using the treasury-stock method or, for participating securities, the if-converted method or two-class method, whichever is more dilutive. Common equivalent shares outstanding includes the dilutive effects from the assumed issuance, exercise or conversion of warrants, equity-based awards, and the Convertible Preferred Stock, except when antidilutive.

The Company had an ownership interest in RSS and ROS of and , respectively, while Techcom had ownership interests in RSS and ROS of and , respectively. Voting rights, board representation and distribution of residual returns are proportionate to these equity interests. 
 
 M O Services provided under the joint venture include development, operation and maintenance of satellite communication systems and ground facilities as well as in-orbit testing and educational support services on delivered infrastructure. These services are jointly performed with ROS serving as a subcontractor to RSS. Pursuant to an agreement dated April 1, 2022 (the Transfer Agreement ), all M O activities were transferred from ROS to RSS, including personnel, and the subcontractor relationship between ROS and RSS was terminated on the same date. 
 
 The joint venture automatically terminated on the earlier of: (i) the expiration of the M O Service agreement with ESA, unless other business is conducted by either company at the time of expiration, (ii) complete withdrawal of ownership interests held by Space NV or Techcom, or (iii) unanimous consent by the shareholders that both RSS and ROS are dissolved. 
 
 In May 2024, Space NV seller and Techcom purchaser entered into a share purchase agreement (the SPA Agreement ), whereby the seller sold to the purchaser all the shares owned by the seller in both ROS and RSS for total cash consideration of million million), effectuating a complete withdrawal of ownership interests held by Space NV, and terminating the joint ventures, resulting in an aggregate gain on the sale of joint ventures of million. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had no remaining ownership interest in ROS and RSS. As a result of the sale, the Company reclassified million out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the accumulated translation adjustments of ROS and RSS. The reclassified accumulated translation adjustments are included in other (income) expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 Prior to the SPA Agreement, the Company had significant influence over the joint venture operations and received a management fee in exchange for administrative services. Both RSS and ROS were accounted for under the VIE model due to insufficient equity investment at risk to finance operations without subordinated financial support. Additional information with regard to these entities is provided below. 
 
 Consolidated Variable Interest Entity 
 ROS was formed with an initial issued share capital of million representing shares of par value each. The shares were fully paid upon incorporation with Space NV and Techcom owning and , respectively. ROS s board of directors is composed of members elected for renewable terms of years. 
 
 Prior to the SPA Agreement, the Company evaluated its interests in the joint venture and determined that Space NV had a variable interest in ROS as of December 31, 2023. Due to their power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, Space NV was determined to be the primary beneficiary and, therefore, consolidated ROS as of December 31, 2023. Total assets and total liabilities for ROS were million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 As a result of the SPA Agreement, the Company evaluated its interests in the joint venture and determined that Space NV no longer had a variable interest in ROS. Therefore, the Company deconsolidated ROS as of June 30, 2024, resulting in a million gain, which is included in other (income) expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Net income from ROS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was de minimis for disclosure.

 Prior to the SPA Agreement, the Company determined that Space NV was not the primary beneficiary of RSS due to Techcom having the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance. As a result of having ownership greater than 20 but less than 50 and holding two of five board seats, Space NV had the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity. Accordingly, RSS was accounted for as an equity method investment. 
 
 Net income (loss) from RSS was de minimis for disclosure for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recognized a loss from RSS of million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income (loss) from RSS is included in other (income) expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). As a result of the SPA Agreement, the Company determined it no longer had a variable interest in RSS. Therefore, the Company derecognized the carrying value of the equity method investment as of June 30, 2024, resulting in a gain of million, which is included in other (income) expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

 Results of Operations 
 Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. As a result, revenues on contracts are recorded over time based on progress towards completion for a particular contract, including the estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in consolidated revenues should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in consolidated cost of sales because changes in revenues are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. 
 
 Net EAC Adjustments 
 We record changes in costs estimated at completion (net EAC adjustments) using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. Net EAC adjustments can have a significant effect on reported revenues and gross profit and the table below presents the aggregate amounts for the following periods: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Gross favorable 
 6,087 7,127 11,259 11,805 Gross unfavorable 
 (7,639) (4,674) (19,838) (11,036) Total net EAC adjustments 
 (1,552) 2,453 (8,579) 769 
 
 The Company evaluates the contract value and cost estimates at completion for performance obligations no less frequently than quarterly, and more frequently when circumstances significantly change. Changes in contract estimates occur for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, changes in contract scope, labor productivity, the nature and technical complexity of the work to be performed, availability and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and vendor performance, volume assumptions, inflationary trends, and schedule and performance delays. We utilize information available to us at the time when revising our estimates and apply consistent judgement across the full portfolio of programs. Refer to Note L Revenues of the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.

 Revenues 
 Revenues increased 10 to 68.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 62.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase in revenues is primarily due to increases in average contract size and increased volume of production in power generation offerings. These increases were partially offset by 1.6 million of net unfavorable EAC adjustments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.5 million net favorable EAC adjustments for the same period in 2023. Please refer to Note L Revenues of the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements

 for additional information related to the Company s net EAC adjustments. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales increased 11.1 million, or 24 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase in cost of sales was driven by increased labor, materials and subcontractor costs primarily associated with larger contracts in power generation offerings for which there were no related costs during the same period in 2023. 
 
 Gross Profit and Margin 
 Gross profit decreased 5.1 million, or 30 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin was 18 and 27 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was driven by changes in contract mix, including larger contracts with lower margins and completion of certain higher margin contracts, impacting the overall contract portfolio gross margin. The decrease is also partially due to the 1.6 million net unfavorable EAC adjustments for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Please refer to Note L Revenues of the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the Company s net EAC adjustments. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative SG A Expenses 
 SG A expenses decreased 0.8 million, or 4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same period in 2023. The year-over-year decrease in SG A expenses was primarily driven by a decrease of 1.5 million in professional fees, partially offset by an increase of 0.8 million in legal fees. This contributed to a year-over-year decrease of SG A as a percentage of revenue to 26 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 29 for the same period in 2023. This decrease reflects the Company s continued focus on cost discipline and streamlining corporate overhead costs to enhance operating leverage. 
 
 Transaction Expense 
 Transaction expenses increased 5.1 million, or 100.0 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to 1.1 million of costs incurred related to the Hera acquisition as well as pre-acquisition costs incurred consisting of due diligence and additional expenses related to prospective acquisitions. 
 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses increased 0.4 million, or 24 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to strategic decisions to invest in future developments related to avionics and sensors, radio frequency, power generation technologies and microgravity payloads. 
 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense, net increased 1.0 million, or 37 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to an increase in our cost of capital due to unfavorable changes in variable interest rates on the Company s debt obligations and increased borrowings on the revolving credit facility compared to the same period in 2023. Refer to Note G Debt of the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the Company s debt obligations. 
 
 Other (Income) Expense, net 
 Other (income) expense, net increased by 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an 8.0 million loss contingency recognized for a litigation matter, for which there was no comparable cost in the same period of 2023. The increase was partially offset by a gain of 1.9 million recognized as a result of changes in the fair value of the private warrant liability during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a loss of 0.5 million recognized during the same period of 2023. The increase was also partially offset by a more favorable impact from foreign currency transactions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Refer to Note J Commitments and Contingencies and Note D Fair Value of Financial Instruments of the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to litigation matters and private warrants, respectively.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Information 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we changed the Supplemental Non-GAAP Information to present only Adjusted EBITDA, whereas prior period disclosures also presented Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes the presentation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA no longer provides the same meaningful insights into the Company s performance as it did during the initial years of the Company s formation. Prior period disclosures were recast to conform to current presentation. There was no change in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. 
 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources which are not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP and are considered to be Non-GAAP financial performance measures. These Non-GAAP financial performance measures are used to supplement the financial information presented on a U.S. GAAP basis and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the relevant U.S. GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with information presented on a U.S. GAAP basis. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, impairment expense, acquisition deal costs, acquisition integration costs, acquisition earnout costs, purchase accounting fair value adjustment related to deferred revenue, severance costs, capital market and advisory fees, litigation-related expenses, write-off of long-lived assets, gains on sale of joint ventures, equity-based compensation, committed equity facility transaction costs, debt financing costs, and warrant liability change in fair value adjustments.

Key Performance Indicators 
 The following Key Performance Indicators KPIs are used by Management to assess the financial performance of the Company, monitor relevant trends and support financial, operational and strategic decision-making. Management frequently monitors and evaluates KPIs against internal targets, core business objectives as well as industry peers and may, on occasion, change the mix or calculation of KPIs to better align with the business, its operating environment, standard industry metrics, or other considerations. If the Company changes the method by which it calculates or presents a KPI, prior period disclosures are recast to conform to current presentation. 
 Book-to-Bill 
 Our book-to-bill ratio was as follows for the periods presented: 
 Three Months Ended Last Twelve Months (in thousands, except ratio) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Contracts awarded 
 44,503 46,523 372,249 322,837 Revenues 
 68,638 62,612 298,026 234,020 Book-to-bill ratio 
 0.65 0.74 1.25 1.38 
 Book-to-bill is the ratio of total contracts awarded to revenues recorded in the same period. The contracts awarded balance includes firm contract orders, including time-and-material T M contracts, awarded during the period and does not include unexercised contract options or potential orders under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts. Although the contracts awarded balance reflects firm contract orders, terminations, amendments, or contract cancellations may occur which could result in a reduction to the contracts awarded balance. 
 We view book-to-bill as an indicator of future revenue growth potential. To drive future revenue growth, our goal is for the level of contracts awarded in a given period to exceed the revenue recorded, thus yielding a book-to-bill ratio greater than 1.0. 
 
 Our book-to-bill ratio was 0.65 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.74 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, contracts awarded includes 21.9 million of acquired contract value from the Hera Systems acquisition. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, none of the contracts awarded balance relates to acquired contract value. 
 
 Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.25 for the LTM Last Twelve Months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.38 for the LTM ended September 30, 2023. For the LTM ended September 30, 2024, contracts awarded includes 21.9 million of acquired contract value from the Hera Systems acquisition, which was completed in the third quarter of 2024. For the LTM ended September 30, 2023, contracts awarded includes 109.8 million of acquired contract value from the Space NV acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Backlog 
 The following table presents our contracted backlog as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and related activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 (in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Organic backlog, beginning balance 372,790 313,057 Organic additions during the period 172,101 300,042 Organic revenue recognized during the period (232,697) (243,800) Foreign currency translation (2,229) 3,491 Organic backlog, ending balance 309,965 372,790 Acquisition-related contract value, beginning balance Acquisition-related contract value acquired during the period 21,940 Acquisition-related additions during the period Acquisition-related revenue recognized during the period (1,844) Acquisition-related backlog, ending balance 20,096 Contracted backlog, ending balance 330,061 372,790 
 
 We view growth in backlog as a key measure of our business growth. Contracted backlog represents the estimated dollar value of firm funded executed contracts for which work has not been performed (also known as the remaining performance obligations on a contract). Our contracted backlog includes 16.9 million and 19.3 million in remaining contract value from T M contracts as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Organic backlog change excludes backlog activity from acquisitions for the first four full quarters since the entities acquisition date. Contracted backlog activity for the first four full quarters since the entities acquisition date is included in acquisition-related contracted backlog change. After the completion of four fiscal quarters, acquired entities are treated as organic for current and comparable historical periods. 
 
 Organic contract value includes the remaining contract value as of January 1 not yet recognized as revenue and additional orders awarded during the period for those entities treated as organic. Acquisition-related contract value includes remaining contract value as of the acquisition date not yet recognized as revenue and additional orders awarded during the period for entities not treated as organic. Organic revenue includes revenue earned during the period presented for those entities treated as organic, while acquisition-related revenue includes the same for all other entities, excluding any pre-acquisition revenue earned during the period. The acquisition-related backlog activity presented in the table above is related to the Hera Systems acquisition completed during third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Although contracted backlog reflects business associated with contracts that are considered to be firm, terminations, amendments or contract cancellations may occur, which could result in a reduction in our total backlog. In addition, some of our multi-year contracts are subject to annual funding. Management expects all amounts reflected in contracted backlog to ultimately be fully funded. Contracted backlog from foreign operations in Luxembourg and Belgium was 93.2 million and 106.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These amounts are subject to foreign exchange rate translations from euros to U.S. dollars that could cause the remaining backlog balance to fluctuate with the foreign exchange rate at the time of measurement. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our operations are primarily funded with cash flows provided by operating activities and access to existing credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 27.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and 18.0 million in available borrowings from our existing credit facilities. Additionally, we had 15.3 million in restricted cash which includes 7.8 million of proceeds received from third-parties that is refundable except in certain limited circumstances. Restricted cash consists of a cash-collateralized standby letter of credit for a submitted proposal. 
 Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are for the Company s material cash requirements, including working capital needs, satisfaction of our indebtedness and contractual commitments, investment in expanding our breadth and footprint through acquisitions as well as investment in facilities, equipment, technologies, and research and development for our growth initiatives and general corporate needs. 
 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 Our ability to fund our cash needs is dependent upon the successful execution of our business strategy and future operating results. Our future operating results are subject to, among others, general economic conditions, including as a result of heightened inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain pressures, competitive dynamics in our target markets as well as legislative and regulatory factors that may be outside of our control. As part of our business and debt management strategy, we continuously evaluate opportunities to further strengthen our financial and liquidity position, including issuing additional equity or debt securities, refinancing or otherwise restructuring our existing credit facilities, or entering into new financing arrangements. There can be no assurance that any of these actions will be sufficient to allow us to adequately service our debt obligations, meet our debt covenants, or that such actions will not result in an adverse impact on our business. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
 
 We believe our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and comply with our debt covenants for at least the next twelve months from the date on which our condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. 
 
 Indebtedness 
 Please refer to Note G Debt of the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the Company s debt obligations. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the Company s contractual obligations as presented in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 20, 2024, that were outside the ordinary course of our business, except for certain significant future lease obligations as described in Note H Leases. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 From time to time, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, such as standby letter of credits. Liabilities related to these arrangements are generally not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. We do not expect any material impact on our cashflows, results of operations or financial condition to result from these off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 15.3 million of standby letters of credit outstanding for a submitted proposal, which were secured by our restricted cash. Refer to Note B of the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the Company s restricted cash. 

Cash Flows 
 The table below summarizes certain information from the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the following periods: 
 Nine Months Ended (in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of year

Table of Contents 

 Operating activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 10.0 million as compared the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to an increase of 28.1 million in cash used related to the Company s net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the same period in 2023, partially offset by a decrease in cash used by working capital of 11.6 million and increase of 6.6 million in the effects of non-cash adjustments. The decrease in cash used by working capital is primarily related to an increase in other liabilities of 10.6 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of 14.5 million partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 5.0 million and deferred revenue of 7.4 million and an increase in contract assets of 8.8 million. The changes in contract assets, accounts receivable and deferred revenue were primarily driven by the timing of billable milestones during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses is primarily a result of timing of payments and invoice receipt and the increase in other liabilities is primarily related to the loss contingency recognized related to a litigation matter. Please refer to Note J Commitments and Contingencies of the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to litigation matters. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to net proceeds of 4.6 million received from the sale of the Company s joint ventures, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures related to licensed software for internal-use and property, plant and equipment and cash used, net of cash acquired related to the Hera Systems acquisition. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased by 38.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds received from debt of 34.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.8 million in the same period in 2023, advances from third-parties of 7.8 million and proceeds of 0.5 million received from issuance of common stock for the exercise of vested stock options and shares purchased through the ESPP, compared to 0.1 million in the same period in 2023. The increase in proceeds received from debt was driven primarily by increased draws from the Adams Street Revolving Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exposures 
 Our operations in Belgium and Luxembourg conduct transactions that are primarily denominated in euros, which limits our foreign currency exposure. However, changes in exchange rates will affect the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as expressed in U.S. dollars. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our audited financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 20, 2024. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company is a smaller reporting company and is not required to provide the information required under this Item 3. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to management (including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 In connection with the Company s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, the following material weaknesses have been identified: 
 We have not consistently established appropriate authorities and responsibilities in pursuit of financial reporting objectives, as demonstrated by, among other things, insufficient segregation of duties in our finance and accounting functions. 
 We did not design and maintain formal accounting policies, procedures and controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including controls over the preparation and review of business performance reviews, account reconciliations, journal entries and contract estimates used in determining the recognition of revenue. 
 These material weaknesses could result in misstatements of substantially all accounts and disclosures that could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 
 In addition, we did not design and maintain effective information technology IT general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: 
 program change management controls to ensure that information technology program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately; 
 user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and that adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs, and data to appropriate Company personnel; 
 computer operations controls to ensure that critical batch jobs are monitored and data backups are authorized and monitored; and 
 testing and approval controls for program development to ensure that new software development is aligned with business and IT requirements. 
 The IT deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact maintaining effective segregation of duties, as well as the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement of one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected. 
 
 The material weaknesses above did not result in a material misstatement to the condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, nor in any restatements of financial statements previously reported by us. 
 
 Remediation Plans 
 We are in the process of implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses, including training, designing and implementing new control activities, and enhancing existing control activities. 
 We engaged a third-party global consulting firm to accelerate the design of new controls or enhance existing controls to ensure timely and accurate financial reporting. 
 We will continue to conduct training and document our processes and procedures, including accounting policies, and implement a comprehensive financial closing process checklist with additional layers of reviews. We are also in the process of standardizing controls, processes and policies across the Company to ensure consistent application including controls over the preparation and review of business performance reviews, account reconciliations, journal entries and contract estimates used in determining the recognition of revenue. 
 We are in the process of performing an assessment of all IT systems that provide data for financial reporting purposes and consolidating systems where appropriate. As part of this assessment, we will be designing, implementing and documenting IT general controls. 
 We are working to remediate the material weaknesses as efficiently and effectively as possible and expect full remediation will likely go beyond December 31, 2024. At this time, we cannot provide an estimate of costs expected to be incurred in connection with implementing this remediation plan; however, these remediation measures will be time consuming, will result in the Company incurring additional costs, and will place ad ditional demands on our financial and operational resources. 
 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 If we are unable to successfully remediate existing or any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and/or we could become subject to litigation or investigations by the New York Stock Exchange NYSE ), the SEC or other regulatory authorities. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are subject to litigation, claims, investigations and audits arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Although legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to any matters currently pending against Redwire and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. Excluding pending matters referenced below, the outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 For additional information on pending matters, please refer to Note J Commitments and Contingencies of the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. For additional information on the risks associated with the existing and future investigations, lawsuits, arbitration, claims, enforcement actions and other legal proceedings, please refer to Item 1A.
