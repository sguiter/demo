EXPLANATORY NOTE 

The restated condensed consolidated financial
statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (the Restated Financial Statements ), including the notes thereto,
update and revise certain items in the Original Form 10-Q, including: (i) reclassification of mining rights as tangible assets
rather than intangible assets, (ii) correction of errors in the treatment of certain right of use lease assets, (iii) correction of
errors relating to the timing of recording executive bonuses, (iv) reclassification of a tax refinancing liability, (v) correction
of errors in the recording of Deferred other income, (vi) derecognition of certain erroneous currency translation adjustments, (vii)
re-assessing our interest in the net assets of certain of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries, and (viii) correcting
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and the corresponding net loss per share attributable
to Atlas Lithium Corporation common stockholders. 

This Amendment also changes the Original Form 10-Q to (i) update the address of our principal executive
offices; and (ii) amend Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, to reflect the restated numbers derived from the Restated Financial Statements
and corresponding descriptions of our accounting policies. 

For
additional details of each line change, please refer to the section named Restatement of Previously Issued Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2024 and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive loss for the
three months ended March 31, 2024 in Note 1 Organization, Business and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies. 

We have concluded that in light of the errors described above, a material weakness exists in our
internal control over financial reporting and that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March
31, 2024. For a discussion of our consideration of our disclosure controls and procedures, see Part I, Item 4, Controls and
Procedures of this Amendment. 

Except
as described above, no other portion of the Original Form 10-Q is being amended and this Amendment does not reflect any events occurring
after the filing of the Form 10-Q.

CAUTIONARY
 NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions
for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements
of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements regarding
current expectations, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, our future results of operations and financial position, our ability to
effectively process our minerals and achieve commercial grade at scale; risks and hazards inherent in the mining business (including
risks inherent in exploring, developing, constructing and operating mining projects, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, weather
or geologically related conditions); uncertainty about our ability to obtain required capital to execute our business plan; our ability
to hire and retain required personnel; changes in the market prices of lithium and lithium products and demand for such products; the
uncertainties inherent in exploratory, developmental and production activities, including risks relating to permitting, zoning and regulatory
delays related to our projects; uncertainties inherent in the estimation of lithium resources. These statements involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from
any future results, performance or achievement expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 

In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, should, 
 expect, plan, anticipate, could, intend, target, 
 project, contemplate, believe, estimate, predict, potential ,
or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions Factors that could cause future results to materially
differ from the recent results or those projected in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: unprofitable efforts
resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits, but also from finding mineral deposits that, though present, are insufficient
in quantity and quality to return a profit from production; market fluctuations; government regulations, including regulations relating
to royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of minerals, and environmental protection; competition; the loss of services
of key personnel; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, sabotage, government or other interference in the maintenance or provision
of infrastructure as well as general economic conditions. 

The forward-looking
statements in this Quarterly Report are based largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial
trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the factors described under the sections in this
Quarterly Report titled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations and other of our filings made with the SEC. 

You
should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report completely and with the understanding
that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these
cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements
contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.

Leases 

For
the reporting period ended March 31, 2024, no financial leases meeting the criteria outlined in ASC 842 have been identified. 

Operating
Leases 

Right
of use ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the
future lease payments over the lease term. When the rate implicit to the lease cannot be readily determined, we utilize our incremental
borrowing rate in determining the present value of the future lease payments. The ROU asset includes any lease payments made and lease
incentives received prior to the commencement date. Operating lease ROU assets also include any cumulative prepaid or accrued rent when
the lease payments are uneven throughout the lease term. The ROU assets and lease liabilities may include options to extend or terminate
the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. The ROU and lease liabilities are primarily related to commercial
offices with third parties. 

The
lease agreements have terms between to years and the liability was measured at the present value of the lease payments discounted
using interest rates with a weighted average rate of which was determined to be the Company s incremental borrowing rate.
The continuity of the lease liabilities is presented in the table below:

Atlas
Lithium Corporation Atlas Lithium , the Company , we , us , or our 
refer to Atlas Lithium Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries) is a mineral exploration and development company with lithium projects
and multiple lithium exploration properties. In addition, we own exploration properties in other battery minerals, including nickel,
copper, rare earths, graphite, and titanium. Our current focus is the development from exploration to active mining of our hard-rock
lithium project located in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil at a well-known pegmatitic district in Brazil, which has been denominated
by the government of Minas Gerais as Lithium Valley. We intend to mine and then process our lithium-containing ore to produce
lithium concentrate (also known as spodumene concentrate), a key ingredient for the battery supply chain. 

We
are building a modular plant targeted at producing 150,000 tons of lithium concentrate per annum tpa in what we describe
as Phase I. We plan on adding additional modules to the plant with the intent of doubling its production capacity to 300,000 tpa in Phase
II. However, there can be no assurance that we will have the necessary capital resources to develop such facility or, if developed, that
we will reach the production capacity necessary to commercialize our products and with the quality needed to meet market demand.

 hectares (10 km 2 for gold mineral rights, all in exploration stage. 

In
addition, we also have a few additional mineral rights in the process of being acquired and not yet titled in our name. We believe that
we hold the largest portfolio of exploration properties for lithium and other battery minerals in Brazil.

 Table of Contents 

We
are primarily focused on advancing and developing our hard-rock lithium project located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Our Minas
Gerais Lithium Project MGLP is our largest project and consists of 85 mineral rights spread over approximately 468 km 2
 and predominantly located within the Brazilian Eastern Pegmatitic Province which has been surveyed by the Brazilian Geological
Survey and is known for the presence of hard rock formations known as pegmatites which contain lithium-bearing minerals such as spodumene
and petalite. 

We
believe that we can increase our value by continuing of our exploratory work and quantification of our lithium mineralization as well
as by expanding our exploration campaign to new, high-potential areas within our portfolio of mineral rights. Our initial commercial
goal is to be able to enter production of lithium concentrate, a product which is highly sought after in the battery supply chain
for electric vehicles. 

We
also have 100 -ownership of early-stage projects and properties in other minerals that are needed in the battery supply chain and high
technology applications such as nickel, copper, rare earths, graphite, and titanium. We believe that the shift from fossil fuels to battery
power may yield long-term opportunities for us not only in lithium but also in such other minerals. 

In
addition to these projects, we own 58.71 of the shares of common stock of Apollo Resources, a private company primarily focused on the
development of its initial iron mine. 

We
also own approximately 27.42 of the shares of common stock of Jupiter Gold, a company focused on the exploration of two gold projects
and a quartzite mine, the common stock of which is quoted on the OTCQB marketplace under the symbol JUPGF. The quartzite
mine started preliminary operations in June 2023. 

The
results of operations from both Apollo Resources and Jupiter Gold are consolidated in our financial statements under U.S. GAAP. 

Operational
Update 

Lithium
Exploration Campaign 

Our
ongoing drilling campaign is delineating the lithium resources of our 100 -owned Neves Project, a cluster of four lithium mineral rights
within MGLP. Our current geological team is comprised of 15 geologists, all of whom are full-time employees. To support the work of our
geologists we have 13 full-time field and support technicians and machinery operators, as well as 3 trainee technicians and over 19 field
assistants. Our geological team and our exploration campaign is supervised by James Abson, a Qualified Person for lithium as such term
is defined in Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC Regulation S-K 1300 ). Mr. Abson was appointed as our
Chief Geology Officer in October 2023 and has over 29 years of diverse experience in mining and mineral exploration. 

Under
Mr. Abson s leadership, our technical team adopted a systematic approach to exploration of additional potential target areas within
the Neves Project. These efforts involve geological mapping, sampling of historical artisanal mining sites and exposed pegmatites to
analyze potassium-rubidium ratios, as well as soil sampling using both XRF and ICP testing for both LCT pathfinders and Li. Geophysical
surveys, including magnetics, are used when warranted to pinpoint additional pegmatite deposits and related structures. Deep trenching
of anomalous areas is used to identify and confirm lithium-cesium-tantalum (LCT) pegmatites and estimate width, strike, dip and mineralization
prior to drilling. Finally, scout drilling is aimed at testing the highest priority pegmatite targets that appear widest and most mineralized.
Within Neves Project area, four confirmed pegmatite bodies with spodumene mineralization were identified (designated as Anitta 1 through
4).

 Table of Contents 

Expanding
beyond the Neves Project area, our regional exploration is now centered on the other mineral rights for lithium within the broader Minas
Gerais Lithium Project MGLP ), a large footprint of 468 km 2 of lithium mineral claims, many of which are located
in Brazil s Lithium Valley, a well-known hard-rock lithium district. A specialized exploration geology team has been assembled
to initiate reconnaissance work across this wider land package. Initial efforts involve LiDAR and geological mapping with a specific
focus on historical artisanal mining sites, sampling of known and previously identified pegmatites, as well as first-pass soil sampling
lines and geophysics to identify anomalies. This phased approach has systematically advanced regional prospecting across our mineral
rights in MGLP with a number of targets generated for further exploration by our exploration team. 

We
have engaged SGS Canada Inc. SGS ), and, in particular, their geologist Marc-Antoine Laporte, a Qualified Person for lithium
under Regulation S-K 1300, to produce a mineral resource estimate report (the Maiden Resource Report for our Neves Project
in accordance with Regulation S-K 1300. Mr. Laporte is the author of mineral resource reports for two other companies which have hard-rock
lithium projects in Lithium Valley, the general area where our Neves Project is located, and has worked on lithium properties in Lithium
Valley since 2017. Mr. Laporte visited our Neves Project between May 4 and May 6, 2023. 

On
March 19, 2024, our Board appointed Brian Talbot to serve as director on the Board, effective as of April 1, 2024. In addition to joining
the Board, Mr. Talbot was also appointed by the Board as our Chief Operating Officer COO ), effective as of April 1, 2024.
In his capacity as COO, Mr. Talbot will be responsible for both the Company s development of its lithium mine and processing plant
as well as all of its lithium exploration geology program. Mr. Talbot is a qualified person for lithium as such a term is defined in
Item 1300 of Regulation S-K. 

Mr.
Talbot has an extensive track record as a technical and operational leader throughout his career with over 30 years of experience in
mining operations. In particular, he has extensive experience in DMS (dense media separation) plant development and operation. Most recently,
Mr. Talbot was employed by RTEK International DMCC RTEK ), a consulting firm that advises lithium developers and producers.
From July 2022 to September 2023, Mr. Talbot was the Chief Operating Officer at Sigma Lithium Corporation Sigma Lithium ),
a Canadian lithium producer with operations in Brazil. At Sigma Lithium, he oversaw the development of that company s flagship
Grota do Cirilo project from construction through commissioning and operations. From 2017 to 2022, Mr. Talbot held positions as General
Manager and Head of Australian Operations at Galaxy Resources, now part of Arcadium Lithium PLC, one of the world s largest fully
integrated lithium companies. While at Galaxy Resources, Mr. Talbot was instrumental in increasing the production at Mt. Cattlin (a hard-rock
lithium mine in Ravensthorpe, Western Australia) which resulted in record production. From 2015 to 2017, Mr. Talbot was at Bikita Minerals
in Zimbabwe, which owns and operates the longest running hard-rock lithium mine in the world. Mr. Talbot holds a bachelor s degree
in chemical engineering with Honors from the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa. Please refer to Part III, Item 10, for further
information on Mr. Talbot. 

Neves
Project 

The
Company s geological team continues to explore the Neves Project area to expand its already known mineralized pegmatite
tonnage. Previously discovered mineralized pegmatites in the Neves Project were initially located with the help of historic
artisanal mines, outcroppings of pegmatite, or shallow sub-crop unearthed by trenching Li in soil anomalies. To date, Atlas has mapped and sampled over 84 pegmatite outcrops within the Neves permit, and ranked them based on
their K/Rb ratios. The more evolved pegmatites have a higher possibility of hosting lithium minerals. In an effort to
expedite the exploration of the substantial surface area of the Neves project, in late 2023, Atlas Lithium embarked on a systematic
exploration campaign designed by James Abson, the Company s Chief Geology Officer.

 Table of Contents 

The
Project Area has now been covered by: 

Detailed
 hyperspectral satellite and drone LiDAR mapping to aid in faster pegmatite discovery; 
 
 Geological
 mapping and rock sampling, including K/Rb ratio analysis, to improve target prioritization;
 
 Closely
 spaced soil sampling 
 
 grids,
 with 4,599 samples taken to date, to highlight Li (>100ppm threshold) and LCT pegmatite
 pathfinder anomalies for drill testing; 

High-resolution
 drone geophysics surveys, including magnetics and radiometrics, to assist with mapping and drill targeting. 

The comprehensive data sets
have generated several highly promising coincident and parallel targets (Figure 1). One notable example is a linear lithium anomaly with
a strike length of 1.2km, which coincides with the Anitta 2 mineralized pegmatite. While some of these targets may represent extensions
of the known mineralized Anitta trends, others could potentially indicate entirely new, untested pegmatite discoveries, particularly in
the southern region of Neves. 

The practical application
of this new lithium soil anomaly information is exemplified at Anitta 1. Previously, an unexplained anomaly existed to the east of the
drilled orebody. Guided by this anomaly, additional drilling has now uncovered the up-dip extension of Anitta 1 and a parallel orebody
immediately to the east. These discoveries are expected to contribute significantly to the project s mineralized pegmatite tonnage, demonstrating
the effectiveness of the exploration approach in identifying and delineating high-quality lithium mineralization.

geophysics data.

 Table of Contents 

Drilled lithium-mineralized sections of pegmatites can extend up to 150m along strike beyond the termination
of the surface lithium anomaly, as observed in the case of Anitta 2. In certain areas, it is probable that these pegmatites continue
undetected from the surface along the same strike direction, particularly beneath higher hills where the cover and weathering profiles
may be thicker. The Company s exploration team is currently evaluating the potential use of other less mobile LCT pathfinders,
such as Cs, Sn, and Ta, to identify new anomalous trends or extensions that warrant further investigation. 

Furthermore,
the majority of the Anitta pegmatites exhibit a close association with magnetic lows and NNE-SSW structural lineaments. This valuable
information will enable the Atlas team to refine its approach to future exploration targeting activities. These activities will include
more detailed follow-up work, such as infill soil grids, trenching, and drilling, to better delineate and characterize the identified
targets. 

Early-Revenue
Strategy 

On
December 4, 2023, we announced implementing an early-revenue strategy. With the well-delineated initial Anitta pegmatites, positive metallurgical
test work and well-advanced mining and environmental permits Atlas Lithium s technical team opted to expedite the production timeline
for its 100 -owned Neves Project. This early-revenue strategy targets initial Phase I production of spodumene concentrate
by the fourth quarter of 2024, ramping up to Phase II production in mid-2025. The early-revenue Phase I plant is expected
to have a maximum capacity of 150,000 tons per annum of spodumene concentrate. 

We
intend to deploy compacted modular dense media separation (DMS) technology together with contracting the crushing and mining operations.
The total capital expenditures, including the initial production and ramp-up is estimated at 49.5 million, which includes the modular
DMS plants, tailings management module for dry stacked tailings; engineering, procurement, construction management costs; earthworks
and civils; site access upgrade, mining preparation and pre-strip, commissioning and ramp-up. The fabrication of the DMS modules, tailing
management module, and associated materials handling equipment is nearing completion and trial assembly is currently underway at the South African manufacturing facility as a quality
assurance measure prior to shipment to Brazil. 

On
February 26, 2024, we announced that the fabrication of the DMS modules, tailing management module, and associated materials handling
equipment is progressing on schedule, and first commissioning and initial production anticipated for the fourth quarter of 2024. The manufacturing orders
were placed by us in December 2023. By condensing components into modules with significantly reduced footprint and weight versus recent
DMS plants, Atlas Lithium plans to streamline installation and commissioning. For example, whereas fully assembled traditional DMS facilities
commonly weigh 250-300 tons, the Company s modular plant is predicted to weigh only approximately 41 tonnes. Modular DMS trial
assembly on the primary 100 tons per hour (tph) module and the secondary 50 tph module. We engaged CDM Group as engineering contractor
and construction coordinator and ADP Marine Modular for plant manufacturing, with both of these firms located in South Africa.
The manufacturing facility located in South Africa has recently been visited by our technical team and photographs of parts completed
and in progress of our modular DMS lithium processing plant under construction can be seen in Figures 2-4 below. Figures 5-7 depict
3-D model views of our planned modular DMS lithium processing plant.

Business
Development Update 

Mitsui
 Co., Ltd. 

On January 18, 2023, we announced that we had signed a non-binding, non-exclusive Memorandum of Understanding MOU with
Mitsui Co., Ltd. Mitsui with respect to Mitsui s potential interest in acquiring the right to purchase our
future lithium concentrate production. In November 2023, we ceased discussions with Mitsui regarding a potential offtake arrangement as
contemplated by the MOU, but continued discussions with Mitsui regarding other possible strategic opportunities. On March 28, 2024, the
Company and Mitsui entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to Mitsui 1,871,250 shares of our common stock
for a purchase price of 30,000,000, representing a 10 premium to the 5-day VWAP . The closing of the sale of the shares occurred on
April 4, 2024. In connection with the sale of the shares, on April 4, 2024, parties entered into an Offtake and Sales Agreement (the Offtake for the future purchase of 15,000 tons of lithium concentrate from Phase 1 and 60,000 tons per year for five years from Phase 2 of Atlas
Lithium s soon to be producing Neves Project in Brazil s Lithium Valley. The investment provided Atlas Lithium with funds
to continue its development towards revenue generation 

Results
of Operations 

The
Three Months Ended March 31, 2024, Compared to the Three Months ended March 31, 2023 

Net
loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024, totaled 13,184,196, compared to net loss of 4,465,353 during the three months
ended March 31, 2023. The increase is mainly due to: 

Higher
 general and administrative expenses of approximately 0.9 million in the period primarily due to increased costs of consultants related to technical services, increased legal fees relating to transactions consummated during the quarter and other third-party costs; 

An
 increase of approximately 5 million in stock-based compensation expense compared to the prior period, reflecting new members of the
 management team eligible for the stock-based compensation program; and 

Higher
 exploration expenses of approximately 2 million for the period due the execution of the drilling program on our 100 owned Minas
 Gerais Lithium Project. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 17,529,465 and working capital of 11,044,828. 

Net
cash used by operating activities totaled 6,103,264 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to net cash used of 3,663,428
during the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease in cash available of 2,439,836 or 67 . The increase in net
cash used by operating activities was mainly due to: 

Increase
 in expenses related to the third companies as consultants and others; 

Increase
 in exploration expenses due to the increase of drilling program and exploration teams.

 Table of Contents 

Net
cash used in investing activities totaled 6,055,535 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to net cash used of
 1,275,972 during the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase in cash used of 4,779,563 or 375 . The increase
reflects the payments made in connection with the construction of our Lithium processing plant. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities totaled 0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 9,564,335 during the three months
ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease in cash provided of 9,564,335 or 100 . The decrease is mainly due to the following financing activities that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2023: 

Our
 underwritten public offering which closed on January 12, 2023, with aggregate gross proceeds of 4,657,500. 

Securities
 Purchase Agreement with two investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to the Investors in a Regulation S private placement
 an aggregate of 640,000 restricted shares of our common stock, at a purchase price of
 6.25 per share, for total gross proceeds of 4,000,000. 

The sale of an aggregate of 91,500 shares of our common stock to Triton Funds, L.P for total
 gross proceeds of 831,834 pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement. 

For
further information on three transactions mentioned above, please refer to note 4 stockholders equity. 

We
have historically incurred net operating losses and have not yet generated material revenues from the sale of products or services. As
a result, our primary sources of liquidity have been derived through proceeds from the (i) sales of our equity and the equity of one
of our subsidiaries, and (ii) issuance of convertible debt. As of March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 17,529,465 and
working capital of 11,044,828, compared to cash and cash equivalents 29,549,927 and a working capital of 23,809,637 as of
December 31, 2023. We believe our cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for
a period of at least twelve months. However, our future short- and long-term capital requirements will depend on several
factors, including but not limited to, the rate of our growth, our ability to identify areas for mineral exploration and the economic
potential of such areas, the exploration and other drilling campaigns needed to verify and expand our mineral resources, the types of
processing facilities we would need to install to obtain commercial-ready products, and the ability to attract talent to manage our different
areas of endeavor. To the extent that our current resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may need to seek additional
equity or debt financing. If the needed financing is not available, or if the terms of financing are less desirable than we expect, we
may be forced to scale back our existing operations and growth plans, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial
prospects and could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Currency
Risk 

We
operate primarily in Brazil, which exposes us to currency risks. Our business activities may generate intercompany receivables or payables
that are in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. Changes in exchange rates from the time the activity occurs
to the time payments are made may result in it receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent at
the time of the original activity. 

Our
consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign
currency and the U.S. dollar affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes
of reporting in the consolidated financial statements. Our foreign subsidiaries translate their financial results from the local currency
into U.S. dollars in the following manner: (a) income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period; (b)
balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates; and (c) equity accounts are translated at
historical exchange rates. Translation in this manner affects the shareholders equity account referred to as the foreign currency
translation adjustment account. This account exists only in the foreign subsidiaries U.S. dollar balance sheets and is necessary
to keep the foreign subsidiaries balance sheets in agreement.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of American U.S. GAAP ).
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe
that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements
is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the design, operation,
and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of March 31, 2024. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
 that the information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure . In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits
of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. On the basis of that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and
Principal Financial Officer concluded that as a result of the material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting, described
in our Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, filed on Form 10-K/A with the SEC
on November 8, 2024 (the Form 10-K/A ), our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024. 

Changes in
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that materially affected,
or would be reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
of the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the information
required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must
reflect the fact that there are resource constrains and that management is required to apply judgement in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 

The following risk factor
disclosures should be read in conjunction with the risk factors described in our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent periodic filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC or the Commission ). We are supplementing the risk factors previously
disclosed in such filings to include the following updated risk factors: 

Investing in our common
stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this
Quarterly Report, including our financial statements and the related notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as any additional risk factors that may be described in our other filings
with the SEC from time to time, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, before deciding whether
to invest in our securities. The occurrence of any of the risks, the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial
condition, operating results, and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may
lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial
also may impair our business operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties summarized and set forth in detail
below and elsewhere in this Annual Report before you decide to invest in our common stock. 

You are unlikely to be able to exercise effective
remedies or collect judgments against BF Borgers relating to their work as our independent registered public accounting firm. 

 BF Borgers (as defined herein) served as our independent
registered public accounting firm from 2015 to 2024 and audited the consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. On May 3, 2024, the SEC entered an order instituting settled administrative and cease-and-desist
proceedings against BF Borgers, permanently barring BF Borgers from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant (the
 Order ). In light of the Order, the Audit Committee dismissed BF Borgers as our independent registered public accounting
firm on May 6, 2024. We have no ability to ascertain whether BF Borgers will survive or that adequate assets will be available to satisfy
any claims against it. As a result, you may not be able to exercise effective remedies or collection judgements against BF Borgers. You
may also be unable to seek remedies against BF Borgers under applicable securities laws for any untrue statement of a material
fact contained in our past financial statements audited by BF Borgers or any omission of a material fact required to be stated
in those financial statements. Also, it is unknown if any assets would be available from BF Borgers to satisfy any claims. 

 We may incur material expenses or delays in
financings or SEC filings due to the dismissal of BF Borgers and our stock price and access to the capital markets may be affected. 

 As a public company, we are
required to file with the SEC financial statements that are audited or reviewed, as applicable, by an independent registered public accountant.
Our access to the capital markets and our ability to make timely filings with the SEC will depend on having financial statements audited
or reviewed again by a new independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, because the SEC found that BF Borgers deliberately
failed to conduct audits and quarterly reviews in accordance with applicable PCAOB standards and fraudulently issued audit reports, we
will not be able to rely on BF Borgers to provide other information or documents that would customarily be received by us or underwriters
in connection with financings or other transactions, including consents and comfort letters. As a result, we may encounter
delays, additional expense and other difficulties in future financings. Any resulting delay in accessing or inability to access the public
capital markets could be disruptive to our operations and could affect the price and liquidity of our securities. Any negative news about
the proceedings against BF Borgers may also adversely affect investor confidence in companies that were previous clients of BF Borgers.
All of these factors could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital
markets.
