ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

PRELIMINARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Statements that
are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
include statements preceded by, followed by, or that include the words may , could , would , should ,
 believe , expect , anticipate , plan , estimate , target ,
 project , intend , foresee and similar expressions. These statements include, among others, statements
regarding our expected business outlook, anticipated financial and operating results, our business strategy and means to implement the
strategy, our objectives, the amount and timing of capital expenditures, the likelihood of our success in expanding our business, financing
plans, budgets, working capital needs, and sources of liquidity. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. 

Forward-looking
statements are only predictions and are not guarantees of performance. These statements are based on our management s beliefs and
assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements
include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the expansion of product offerings geographically or through new
marketing applications, the timing and cost of planned capital expenditures, competitive conditions, and general economic conditions.
These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Forward-looking statements also involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. In addition, even if our actual results
are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, those results may not be indicative
of results or developments in subsequent periods. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Such factors include,
but are not limited to, the following: 

Our
 ability to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms and conditions; 

Our
 ability to manage credit and debt structures from vendors, debt holders, and secured lenders. 

Our
 ability to manage the growth of our business through internal growth and acquisitions; 

Competitive
 pressures; 

Our
 ability to attract and retain management, and to integrate and maintain technical information and management information systems. 

Compliance
 with laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, corporate governance matters and tax matters, as well
 as any future changes to such laws and regulations; and 

For
a more detailed discussion of some of the foregoing risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023
Form 10-K and Item 1A Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September
30, 2024, as well as other reports and registration statements filed by us with the SEC. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive
and should be read with other cautionary statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other public filings. For more information

Cybersecurity 

Risk
Management and Strategy 

We
recognize the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information
systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. 

Managing
Material Risks Integrated Overall Risk Management 

We
have strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework to promote a company-wide culture
of cybersecurity risk management. This integration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making
processes at every level. Our management team continuously evaluates and addresses cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business
objectives and operational needs. 

Oversee
Third-party Risk 

Because
we are aware of the risks associated with third-party service providers, we have implemented stringent processes to oversee and manage
these risks. We conduct thorough security assessments of all third-party providers before engagement and maintain ongoing monitoring
to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards. The monitoring includes annual assessments of the SOC reports of our providers
and implementing complementary controls. This approach is designed to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents
originating from third-parties. 

Risks
from Cybersecurity Threats 

We
have not encountered cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing.

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure and Control Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures , as such terms are defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Principal Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures. The Company acknowledges that any controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving
the desired control objectives. 

We
have carried out an evaluation as required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer concluded
that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Although we have determined
that the existing controls and procedures are not effective, the deficiencies identified have not been deemed material to our reporting
disclosures. 

(b)
Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such
term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed
by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, and affected by our Board, management
and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Internal
control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving their objectives. Internal control over financial reporting
is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgement and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
Due to their inherent limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by
internal control over financial reporting. It is possible to design safeguards to reduce, but not eliminate, this risk. Management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. 

Management
has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), known as COSO, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Based on such an evaluation, our CEO concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal controls over
financial reporting were not effective. 

As
a result of our evaluation, we identified a material weakness in our controls related to segregation of duties and other immaterial weaknesses
in several areas of data management and documentation. 

Our
management is composed of a small number of professionals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist.
Accordingly, and as a result of the material weakness identified above, we have concluded that the control deficiencies result in a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented on a timely basis by the
Company s internal controls. We continue to employ and refine a structure in which critical accounting policies, issues and estimates
are identified, and together with other complex areas, are subject to multiple reviews by executives. In addition, we evaluate and assess
our internal controls and procedures regarding our financial reporting, utilizing standards incorporating applicable portions of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board s 2009 Guidance for Smaller Public Companies in Auditing Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting as necessary on an on-going basis. 

While
the material weakness set forth above was the result of the scale of the Company s operations and is intrinsic to its small size,
the Company believes the risk of material misstatements relative to financial reporting are minimal. 

This
quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by its registered public accounting firm pursuant to the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which permits the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

(c)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act,
during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
