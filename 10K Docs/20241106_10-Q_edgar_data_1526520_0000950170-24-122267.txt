Assuming the conversion of all of LTRIP s shares of Class B common stock into common stock, LTRIP would beneficially own approximately of the outstanding common stock. Because each share of Class B common stock is entitled to votes per share and each share of common stock is entitled to vote per share , LTRIP may be deemed to beneficially own equity securities representing approximately of our voting power.

As of January 1, 2023, we had million recorded as deferred revenue on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, of which million and million was recognized as revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , refunds due to cancellations by travelers were not material, while refunds due to cancellations by travelers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million. The difference between the opening and closing balances of our deferred revenue primarily results from the timing differences between when we receive customer payments and the time in which we satisfy our performance obligations.

billion of cash and cash equivalents, which consisted of available on demand bank deposits and money market funds, with maturities of major global financial institutions. We had outstanding investments classified as either short-term or long-term marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, and there were no purchases or sales of any marketable securities during and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Level 1: 

Money market funds 

Total 

(1) 

We generally classify cash equivalents and marketable securities, if any, within Level 1 and Level 2 as we value these financial instruments using quoted market prices (Level 1) or alternative pricing sources (Level 2). The valuation technique we use to measure the fair value of money market funds is derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values for Level 2 investments are considered Level 2 valuations because they are obtained from independent pricing sources for identical or comparable instruments, rather than direct observations of quoted prices in active markets. Our procedures include controls to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded, including comparing the fair values obtained from our independent pricing services against fair values obtained from another independent source. Derivative Financial Instruments . Our outstanding or unsettled forward contracts are carried at fair value on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. We measure the fair value of outstanding or unsettled derivatives using Level 2 fair value inputs, as we use a pricing model that takes into account the contract terms as well as current foreign currency exchange rates in active markets. We recognize any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value of foreign currency forward contracts in other income (expense), net on our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations . We recorded a net loss of million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a net gain of million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Counterparties to our outstanding forward contracts consist of major global financial institutions. We monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy limits, the amount of credit exposure to any one party. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We did not enter into any cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Other Financial Assets and Liabilities As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis including accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and deferred merchant payables, were carried at cost on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these items. Accounts receivable, including contract assets as described below, as well as certain other financial assets, are measured at amortized cost and are carried at cost less an allowance for expected credit losses on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet to present the net amount expected to be collected. Accounts Receivable, net 

Contract assets 

Total 

Accounts receivable are recognized when the right to consideration becomes unconditional, and are recorded net of an allowance for expected credit losses. We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount. Our customer invoices are generally due from customers 30 days from the time of invoicing. Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time, such as commission payments that are contingent upon the completion of the service by the principal in the transaction. The difference between the opening and closing balances of our contract assets primarily results from the timing difference between when we satisfy our performance obligations and the time when the principal completes the service in the transaction. During the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no significant changes in contract assets related to business combinations, impairments, cumulative catch-ups or other material adjustments.

The Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 unobservable inputs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Risks and Concentrations Our business is subject to certain financial risks and concentrations, including concentration related to dependence on our relationships with our customers. For the year ended December 31, 2023 , our two most significant travel partners, Expedia Group, Inc. (and its subsidiaries) and Booking Holdings, Inc. (and its subsidiaries), each accounted for or more of our consolidated revenue and together accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue, with nearly all of this revenue concentrated in our Brand Tripadvisor segment. Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk, generally consist, at any point in time, of cash and cash equivalents, corporate debt securities, forward contracts, capped calls, and accounts receivable. We maintain cash balances with financial institutions that are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits in the U.S. and similar government programs outside the U.S. Our cash and cash equivalents are generally composed of available on demand bank deposits or term deposits with several major global financial institutions, as well as money market funds, primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and to a lesser extent Euros, British pounds, and Australian dollars. We may invest in highly-rated corporate debt securities, and our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer, industry group and currency. Our credit risk related to corporate debt securities is also mitigated by the relatively short maturity period required by our investment policy. Forward contracts and capped calls are transacted with major international financial institutions with high credit standings. Forward contracts, which, to date, have typically had maturities of less than days, also mitigate risk. Our overall credit risk related to accounts receivable is mitigated by the relatively short collection period. Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-Marketable Investments Equity Securities Accounted for under the Equity Method The Company owns a equity investment in Chelsea Investment Holding Company PTE Ltd., which is majority owned by Ctrip Investment Holding Ltd, a majority-owned subsidiary of Trip.com Group Limited. The Company accounts for this minority investment under the equity method, given it has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. The carrying value of this minority investment was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and is included in non-marketable investments on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. During both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized million, representing our share of the investee s net loss in other income (expenses), net within the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations, while this amount was t material during both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company evaluates this investment for impairment when factors indicate that a decline in the value of its investment has occurred and the carrying amount of its investment may not be recoverable. An impairment loss, based on the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the investment based on Level 3 inputs, is recognized in earnings when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we did t record any impairment loss on this equity investment.

million. The Company has classified the Notes Receivable as held-to-maturity, as the Company has concluded it has the positive intent and ability to hold the Notes Receivable until maturity, with due June 2028 and the remaining due June 2030, or the date on which there is a change in control, whichever is earlier. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Notes Receivable was million, net of accumulated allowance for credit losses, and is classified in other long-term assets, net on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at amortized cost. On a quarterly basis, we perform a qualitative assessment considering impairment indicators to evaluate whether the Notes Receivable are impaired and monitor for changes to our allowance for credit losses.

Credit Agreement We are party to a credit agreement with a group of lenders initially entered into in June 2015 and, amended and restated in June 2023 (the Credit Agreement ), which, among other things, provides for a million secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility has a maturity date of (unless, on any date that is days prior to the final scheduled maturity date in respect of any indebtedness outstanding under certain specified debt, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such specified debt is million or more, then the maturity date will be such business day).

In connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, we incurred lender fees and other debt financing costs of million under the Credit Facility.

These debt issuance costs will be amortized over the remaining term of the Term Loan B Facility, using the effective interest rate method, and recorded to interest expense on our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. As of September 30, 2024, unpaid interest on the Term Loan B Facility was not material and million was recorded as interest expense on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 2025 Senior Notes On , as noted above, the Company redeemed all million aggregate principal amount of the Company s outstanding 2025 Senior Notes, in addition to the settlement of accrued and unpaid interest . As a result, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of million, which primarily consisted of a non-cash write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, and is included in Other income (expense), net on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, unpaid interest of million related to the 2025 Senior Notes, was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.

million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and our income tax provision was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The change in our income tax provision during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily the result of an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") audit settlement for the 2014 through 2016 tax years, and an adjustment to our existing transfer pricing income tax reserves for subsequent tax years recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as discussed below. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of , primarily due to unfavorable stock-based compensation tax effects. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of , primarily due to the result of an IRS audit settlement as noted above.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes 

Our accounting policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits and income tax liabilities as part of our income tax expense. As of September 30, 2024 , we had an accrued interest liability of million, which was 

 18 

penalties were accrued. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2014 through 2016 and 2018 tax years and have various ongoing audits for foreign and state income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding or review of the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. These examinations may lead to proposed or ordinary course adjustments to our taxes. As of September 30, 2024, no material assessments have resulted, except as noted below regarding our 2014 through 2016 standalone IRS audit, and our 2012 through 2016 HM Revenue Customs HMRC audit. As disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustments ("NOPA") from the IRS for the 2014 through 2016 tax years relating to certain transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries. In response, we requested competent authority assistance under the Mutual Agreement Procedure MAP for the 2014 through 2016 tax years. In January 2024, we received notification of a MAP resolution agreement for the 2014 through 2016 tax years, which we accepted in February 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of million and an income tax expense of million, respectively, as discrete items, inclusive of interest, related to this settlement on our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. Separately, we reviewed the impact of the acceptance of this settlement position against our existing transfer pricing income tax reserves for the subsequent open tax years during the first quarter of 2024, which resulted in an income tax benefit, inclusive of estimated interest, of million. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we made a payment to the IRS of million, inclusive of estimated interest, and during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made various state tax payments of million, inclusive of estimated interest, related to this audit settlement. We anticipate a competent authority refund from a foreign jurisdiction and certain federal tax benefits, net of state tax payments due, associated with this IRS audit settlement which will be substantially settled in the next twelve months, resulting in an estimated net cash inflow of million to million, inclusive of related interest. The anticipated competent authority refund is reflected in the current income taxes receivable balance of million, as well as a lesser amount consisting of anticipated federal tax benefits, partially offset by anticipated state tax payments on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we had recorded million of unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest, classified as other long-term liabilities on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. As a result of our acceptance of MAP with the IRS for the 2014 through 2016 tax years, and its impact on other ongoing IRS audits, as described above, we reduced this unrecognized tax benefits liability by million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 by reclassifying this balance to current income taxes payable on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, representing a short-term payment obligation to the IRS, which was subsequently paid during the three months ended June 30, 2024, as noted above. In addition, as disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report, we received a NOPA from the IRS for the 2009 through 2011 tax years relating to certain transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries. In response, we also requested competent authority assistance under MAP for the 2009 through 2011 tax years. In January 2023, we received a final notice from the IRS regarding a MAP resolution agreement for the 2009 through 2011 tax years, which the Company accepted in February 2023. In the first quarter of 2023, we recorded additional income tax expense as a discrete item, inclusive of interest, of million specifically related to this settlement on our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. During the first quarter of 2023, we reviewed the impact of the acceptance of this settlement position against our existing transfer pricing income tax reserves for the subsequent tax years, which resulted in incremental income tax expense, inclusive of estimated interest, of million. The total impact of these adjustments resulted in an incremental income tax expense on our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations of million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we made a U.S. federal tax payment of million, inclusive of interest, to Expedia related to this IRS audit settlement, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Expedia. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we received a competent authority refund of million, inclusive of interest income, related to this IRS audit settlement. In January 2021, we received from HMRC an issue closure notice relating to adjustments for the 2012 through 2016 tax years. These proposed adjustments are related to certain transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries and would result in an increase to our worldwide income tax expense in an estimated range of million to million, exclusive of interest expense, at the close of the audit if HMRC prevails. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and we intend to defend our position through applicable administrative and, if necessary, judicial remedies. Our policy is to review and update tax reserves as facts and circumstances change.

For over two decades, we believe we have built difficult to replicate assets such as a trusted brand, authentic content, a large community of contributors, and one of the largest global travel audiences available. Our long-term strategy for the Brand Tripadvisor segment builds on our heritage and the reasons hundreds of millions of travelers come to Tripadvisor each year. Fundamental to this strategy will be: (1) innovating and enhancing world-class travel guidance and planning products to help travelers make confident decisions in a world where it is hard to find advice you can trust; (2) prioritizing deeper engagement with travelers, increasing members, and repeat customers by leveraging our rich data and technology assets to provide more relevant, curated, and contextual content throughout the traveler journey; and (3) driving a step change in the value we can deliver to our partners by accelerating and diversifying the monetization of our valuable audience across key categories, including hotel meta, media advertising, experiences, and restaurants. As we continue to focus on offering a more compelling product that better meets travelers needs across their end-to-end travel journey, we believe we are better able to drive deeper engagement which drives more direct channel growth, including via our mobile app. As this direct engagement with users improves and scales, we are able to collect valuable data and create more relevant opportunities to monetize, which we believe will result in a meaningfully higher average revenue per user over time. 
 In our Viator and TheFork segments, we provide two-sided marketplaces that connect travelers and diners to operators of bookable experiences and restaurants, respectively. Within our Viator and TheFork segments, we are investing in growth, future scale, 
 27 

and market share gains to accelerate our market leadership position, while working to improve unit economics on both sides of the marketplace with the goal of sustainable future profitability. This means driving awareness and higher quality audience engagement, which we believe will drive greater repeat bookings, more direct traffic, and translate into improved unit economics over time. Our investments on both sides of our marketplace, as well as in our primary offerings, are intended to deliver a differentiated value proposition that we believe will drive sustainable market leadership as our partners, operators, and travelers find themselves in an increasingly competitive marketplace environment. We are focused on continuing to grow both our supplier base and our user base by offering innovative tools and features on our branded platforms, and through continued awareness of our brand through marketing efforts. 
 We are focused on executing initiatives across the Tripadvisor Group through organic investment in data, products, marketing and technology to further enhance the value we deliver to travelers and partners across our brands, platforms, and segments. In addition, we may accelerate growth inorganically by opportunistically pursuing strategic acquisitions. 
 Trends 
 The online travel industry in which we operate is large, highly dynamic and competitive. We describe below current trends affecting our overall business and segments, including uncertainties that may impact our ability to execute on our objectives and strategies. Public health-related events, such as a pandemic, political instability, geopolitical conflicts, including the evolving events in the Middle East, acts of terrorism, fluctuations in currency values, and changes in global economic conditions, are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry and, as a result, our financial results in the future. 
 Prior to Google introducing changes to its search engine results page SERP ), we generated a significant amount of direct traffic from search engines, including Google, through strong search engine optimization SEO performance across all segments. We believe our SEO traffic acquisition performance has been negatively impacted in the past, and may be impacted in the future, by metasearch and search engines (primarily Google) changing their search result placement and underlying algorithms, including to increase the prominence of their own products in search results across our business, most notably within our hotel meta offering within our Brand Tripadvisor segment. 
 In response to the large underpenetrated market for experiences, Viator continues to invest in marketing to drive awareness and grow market share. Over the long-term, we are focused on driving a greater percentage of our bookings from direct channels. We are doing this by continuing to focus on increasing our brand recognition and improving the user experience across products on our website and mobile app, providing high-quality customer service, and offering leading customer choice for online bookable experiences supply. 
 The global experiences market is large, growing, and highly fragmented, with the vast majority of bookings still occurring through traditional offline sources. We are observing a secular shift, however, as this market continues to grow and accelerate the pace of online adoption. Likewise, the global restaurants category is also benefiting from increased online adoption by both consumers and restaurant partners, particularly in Europe. Given the competitive positioning of our businesses relative to the attractive growth prospects in the experiences and restaurant categories, we expect to continue to invest in these categories across Tripadvisor Group and, in particular, within the Viator and TheFork segments, to continue accelerating revenue growth, operating scale, and market share gains for the long-term. 
 Recent Developments 
 As disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report, in August 2023, we received a NOPA from the IRS for the 2014 through 2016 tax years relating to certain transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries. In response, we requested competent authority assistance under the MAP for the 2014 through 2016 tax years. In January 2024, we received notification of a MAP resolution agreement for the 2014 through 2016 tax years, which we accepted in February 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of 4 million and an income tax expense of 41 million, respectively, as discrete items, inclusive of interest, related to this settlement on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we made a payment to the IRS of 141 million, inclusive of estimated interest, and during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made various state tax payments of 18 million, inclusive of estimated interest, related to this settlement. We anticipate a competent authority refund from a foreign jurisdiction and certain federal tax benefits, net of state tax payments due, associated with this IRS audit settlement which will be substantially settled in the next twelve months, resulting in an estimated net cash inflow of 50 million to 60 million, inclusive of related interest. Refer to Note 8: Income Taxes in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for further information regarding potential material contingencies related to ongoing audits regarding income taxes. 
 28 

On July 8, 2024, under the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company issued a 500 million Term Loan B Facility maturing July 8, 2031, with an interest rate based on secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR") plus 2.75 . On July 15, 2024, the Company used these borrowed funds to fully redeem its outstanding 500 million, 2025 Senior Notes. The Term Loan B Facility was offered at 99.75 of par and is required to be paid down at 1.00 of the aggregate principal amount per year, repayable in quarterly installments on the last day of each calendar quarter, commencing December 31, 2024, equal to 0.25 of the original principal amount with the balance due on the maturity date. Refer to Note 6: Debt in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report for further information. 
 Employees 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 2,890 employees. Approximately 60 , 35 , and 5 of the Company s current employees are based in Europe, the U.S., and the rest of world ROW ), respectively. Additionally, we use independent contractors to supplement our workforce. We believe we have good relationships with our employees and contractors, including relationships with employees represented by international works councils or other similar organizations. 
 Seasonality 
 Consumer travel expenditures have historically followed a seasonal pattern. Correspondingly, travel partner advertising investments, and therefore our revenue and operating profits, have also historically followed a seasonal pattern. Our financial performance tends to be seasonally highest in the second and third quarters of a given year, which includes the seasonal peak in consumer demand, including traveler accommodation stays, and travel experiences taken, compared to the first and fourth quarters, which represent seasonal low points. In addition, during the first half of the year, experience bookings typically exceed the amount of completed experiences, resulting in higher cash flow related to working capital; while during the second half of the year, particularly in the third quarter, this pattern reverses and cash flows from these transactions are typically negative . Other factors may also impact typical seasonal fluctuations, such as significant shifts in our business mix, adverse economic conditions, public health-related events, as well as other factors . 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that management use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, when applicable and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 There are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 
 it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and/or 

changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements 
 There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies or new accounting pronouncements that we have been required to adopt that may have an impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements since December 31, 2023, as compared to those described under Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our 2023 Annual Report.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA Margin by Segment is defined as Adjusted EBITDA by segment divided by revenue by segment. 

Brand Tripadvisor Segment 
 Brand Tripadvisor segment revenue decreased by 35 million and 68 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in our hotel meta revenue and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in hotel B2B revenue. 
 Adjusted EBITDA in our Brand Tripadvisor segment decreased by 24 million and 31 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, while Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 4 percentage points and 1 percentage point during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to a decrease in revenue, as noted above, and to a lesser extent a decrease in the segment's operating expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, of 11 million and 37 million, respectively, primarily related to a decrease in direct selling and marketing expenses, primarily paid online traffic acquisition costs, and to a lesser extent a decrease in overall personnel and overhead costs. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA margin during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, was largely due to an increase in technology and content personnel and overhead costs, and to a lesser extent, an increase in direct costs within cost of revenue, as a percent of revenue.

Refer to Note 13: Segment Information in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of intersegment revenue for all periods presented. 

Tripadvisor-branded Hotels Revenue 
 Tripadvisor-branded hotels revenue decreased by 30 million and 64 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in our hotel meta revenue and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in hotel B2B revenue, as the Company transitions from a sales-led model to a self-service model. The decrease in our hotel meta revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily driven by continued headwinds impacting free channels, including SEO traffic, contributing to a decrease in click volumes, and to a lesser extent, a deceleration in cost-per-click CPC rates, particularly in the U.S. The decrease in our hotel meta revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was driven by declines in our U.S. hotel meta revenue and, to a lesser extent, our European hotel meta revenue, primarily due to weaker demand related to increased competition in paid online marketing channels and continued headwinds impacting free channels, including SEO traffic, during the second and third quarters of 2024, contributing to a decrease in click volumes. 
 Media and Advertising Revenue 
 Media and advertising revenue consists of revenue from display-based advertising (or media advertising across our Tripadvisor Group platform. Media and advertising revenue increased 2 million and 4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to an increase in overall advertising campaigns and pricing. 
 Tripadvisor Experiences and Dining Revenue 
 Tripadvisor experiences and dining revenue, which includes intercompany (intersegment) revenue consisting of affiliate marketing commissions earned primarily from experience bookings and, to a lesser extent, restaurant reservation bookings on Tripadvisor-branded websites and mobile apps, fulfilled by Viator and TheFork, respectively, are eliminated on a consolidated basis, in addition to revenue earned from Tripadvisor's restaurants service offerings. Tripadvisor experiences and dining revenue decreased 4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decline in dining revenue as we move from a sales-led model to a self-service model, and to a lesser extent some deceleration in experiences growth during the third quarter of 2024, as our near-term segment marketing strategy emphasizes profitability. Tripadvisor experiences and dining revenue decreased 3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decline in dining revenue as we move from a sales-led model to a self-service model, as noted above, partially offset by an increase in experiences revenue, despite some deceleration in experiences revenue growth, as noted above, during the second and third quarters of 2024. 
 Other Revenue 
 Other revenue includes alternative accommodation rentals revenue, in addition to click-based advertising and display-based advertising revenue from our cruise, flights, and rental cars offerings on Tripadvisor websites and mobile apps. Other revenue decreased 3 million and 5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to a decline in alternative accommodation rentals revenue as we continue to strategically de-emphasize this offering. 
 Viator Segment 
 Viator segment revenue increased by 25 million and 79 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by consumer demand for experiences across all geographies, driving growth in bookings, partially offset by some deceleration in revenue growth in the Brand Tripadvisor point-of-sale during the second and third quarters of 2024, as noted above. We continue to believe that Viator is benefiting from a larger macro trend, as the large global market in which it operates continues to grow and migrate online from traditional offline sources. 
 Adjusted EBITDA in our Viator segment improved by 13 million and 28 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, and Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 4 percentage points and 5 percentage points during three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. These improvements in Adjusted EBITDA were primarily due to increased leverage as we scale the business and drive a greater number of bookings from more profitable repeat customers. These improvements were partially offset by our continued investment in marketing, primarily paid online traffic acquisition costs, in response to consumer demand for 
 32 

experiences and increased investment focusing on growing market share, acquiring new customers, and driving brand awareness. In addition, increased personnel and overhead costs to support business growth and invest in our product experience and, to a lesser extent, increased licensing costs, and an increase in revenue generation costs resulting from credit card payments in direct correlation with the increase in revenue, all negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA. The improvements in Adjusted EBITDA margin were primarily due to a decrease in selling and marketing costs, largely brand marketing, as a percent of revenue. 
 TheFork Segment 
 TheFork segment revenue increased by 7 million and 18 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. These improvements were driven by increased consumer demand for dining in Europe, including increased bookings and pricing, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023. In addition, we estimate this segment's revenue growth rate was positively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 2 during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA in TheFork segment improved by 6 million and 19 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, while Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 12 percentage points and 16 percentage points during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in revenue as noted above, and lower personnel and overhead costs. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to lower personnel and overhead costs as a percent of revenue. 
 Consolidated Expenses 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue consists of expenses that are directly related or closely correlated to revenue generation, including direct costs, such as credit card and other booking transaction payment fees, data center costs, including cloud-based solutions, media production costs, ad serving fees, and other revenue generating costs. In addition, cost of revenue includes personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and bonuses for certain customer support personnel who are directly involved in revenue generation.

Cost of revenue increased 4 million and 15 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to increased direct costs from credit card payment processing fees and other revenue-related transaction costs in our Viator segment in direct correlation with the increase in revenue, as Viator serves as the merchant of record for the significant majority of its experience booking transactions. The increase in cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to increased direct costs from credit card payment processing fees and other revenue-related transaction costs in our Viator segment, as noted above, as well as, increased direct revenue generation costs related to data center costs and media production costs in our Brand Tripadvisor segment. 
 Selling and Marketing 
 
 Selling and marketing expenses consist of direct costs, including traffic generation costs from paid online traffic acquisition costs (including SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs), syndication costs and affiliate marketing commissions, social media costs, brand advertising (including television and other offline advertising), promotions and public relations. In addition, our selling 
 33 

and marketing expenses consist of indirect costs such as personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, stock-based compensation, bonuses for sales, sales support, customer support and marketing employees.

Direct selling and marketing costs as a percentage of consolidated revenue was 41 during both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Direct selling and marketing costs decreased by 2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in overall marketing costs in Brand Tripadvisor of 8 million, partially offset by an increase in overall marketing costs in our Viator segment of 4 million, in order to capture consumer demand, including increased investment within our Viator segment focused on growing market share, acquiring new customers, and driving brand awareness. 
 Direct selling and marketing costs as a percentage of consolidated revenue was 42 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 43 in the same period in 2023. Direct selling and marketing costs decreased by 3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in overall marketing costs in Brand Tripadvisor of 28 million, partially offset by an increase in overall marketing costs in our Viator segment of 21 million, in order to capture consumer demand, including increased investment within our Viator segment focused on growing market share, acquiring new customers, and driving brand awareness. 
 Personnel and overhead costs decreased 3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by a reduction in headcount related to our cost-reduction measures taken during 2023 in Brand Tripadvisor and TheFork, partially by offset by an increase in personnel and overhead costs to support business growth in Viator, as well as, an increase in stock-based compensation. 
 Technology and Content 
 
 Technology and content expenses consist primarily of personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and bonuses for salaried employees and contractors engaged in the design, development, testing, content support, and maintenance of our platform. Other costs include licensing, maintenance, computer supplies, telecom, content translation and localization, and consulting costs.

Technology and content costs increased 7 million and 19 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher personnel and overhead costs, including stock-based compensation costs, in our Brand Tripadvisor and Viator segments, in support of product development, and in addition, increased licensing costs. 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs, including personnel engaged in leadership, finance, legal, and human resources, as well as stock-based compensation expense for those same personnel. General and 
 34 

administrative costs also include professional service fees and other fees including audit, legal, tax and accounting, and other operating costs including bad debt expense, non-income taxes, such as sales, use, digital services, and other non-income related taxes.

Personnel and overhead costs increased by 2 million and did not materially change during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by an increase in stock-based compensation, largely offset by a reduction in headcount related to cost reduction measures taken during 2023 in our Brand Tripadvisor segment. 
 Professional service fees and other costs increased by 17 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an estimated accrual for the potential settlement of a regulatory related matter of 10 million during the first quarter of 2024, and to a lesser extent, incremental digital service tax costs of 5 million, primarily resulting from enacted tax legislation in Canada during June 2024. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation expense consists of depreciation on computer equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture, office equipment and other assets, and amortization of capitalized website development costs and right-of-use ROU assets related to our finance lease. Amortization consists of the amortization of definite-lived intangibles purchased in business acquisitions.

Interest expense increased 2 million during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the issuance of our Term Loan B Facility in July 2024, which has currently increased our cost of capital. The majority of interest expense reported during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to the Term Loan B Facility, while during the three ended September 30, 2023 and both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense incurred was primarily related to the 2025 Senior Notes which were redeemed in July 2024. Refer to Note 6: Debt in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report for further information on material capital structure changes and cost of capital during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income primarily consists of interest earned from available on demand bank deposits, term deposits, money market funds, and marketable securities, including amortization of discounts and premiums on our marketable securities.

Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 , primarily due to unfavorable stock-based compensation tax effects. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 , primarily as a result of a discrete item recorded during the first quarter of 2024, as described below. 
 36 

We recorded an income tax provision of 27 million and 84 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The change in our income tax provision and our effective tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily the result of an IRS audit settlement, which we recorded an income tax expense of 41 million, as a discrete item, inclusive of interest, primarily during the first quarter of 2024, related to this settlement on our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. In addition, we reviewed the impact of the acceptance of this settlement position against our existing transfer pricing income tax reserves for the subsequent open tax years during the first quarter of 2024, which resulted in an income tax benefit, inclusive of estimated interest, of 4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, specifically in the first quarter of 2023, we recorded a net income tax expense of 55 million related to an IRS audit settlement and related adjustment to existing transfer pricing income tax reserves for subsequent tax years.

Net income increased 12 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Improvements in net income were largely driven by restructuring costs incurred of 18 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, which did not reoccur during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in income tax expense of 10 million, as well as a decrease in direct selling and marketing costs primarily in our Brand Tripadvisor segment. These improvements were largely offset by increased direct revenue generation costs related to data center costs and media production costs in our Brand Tripadvisor segment, an increase in direct selling and marketing costs in our Viator segment, as well as, increased direct costs from credit card payment and other revenue-related transaction costs in direct correlation with the increase in experiences revenue. All drivers discussed above are described in more detail above under Consolidated Expenses. 
 Net loss improved by 26 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The improvement in net loss was largely driven by increased revenue, as described in more detail above under Revenue and Segment Information , a decrease in income tax expense of 31 million, as described in more detail above under (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes , restructuring costs incurred of 18 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which did not reoccur during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, a decrease in direct selling and marketing costs in our Brand Tripadvisor segment, as well as a decrease in personnel and overhead costs primarily in our Brand Tripadvisor segment, also contributed to the net loss improvement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These improvements were largely offset by increased direct selling and marketing costs in our Viator segment, increased direct revenue generation costs related to data center costs and media production costs in our Brand Tripadvisor segment, as well as, increased direct costs from credit card payment and other revenue-related transaction costs in direct correlation with the increase in experiences revenue, and increased personnel and overhead costs to support growth in our Viator segment, and an estimated accrual for the potential settlement of a regulatory related matter of 10 million during the first quarter of 2024. All drivers discussed above are described in more detail above under Consolidated Expenses. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure refers to a numerical measure of a company s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in such company s financial statements. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is also our segment profit measure and a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate the financial performance of our business and on which internal budgets and forecasts are based and approved. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons and better enables management and investors to compare financial results between periods as these costs may vary independent of ongoing core business performance. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus: (1) provision (benefit) for income taxes; (2) other expense (income), net; (3) depreciation and amortization; (4) stock-based compensation and other stock-settled obligations; (5) goodwill, long-lived asset, and intangible assets impairments; (6) legal reserves and settlements, including indirect tax reserves related to audit 
 37 

settlements and the impact of one-time changes resulting from enacted tax legislation; (7) restructuring and other related reorganization costs (benefit); and (8) non-recurring expenses (income). 
 Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income (loss) and our other GAAP results. 
 Some of these limitations are: 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation or other stock-settled obligations; 

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain income and expenses not directly tied to the ongoing core operations of our business, such as legal reserves and settlements , as well as restructuring and other related reorganization costs (benefit) ; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; 

Adjusted EBITDA is unaudited and does not conform to SEC Regulation S-X, and as a result such information may be presented differently in our future filings with the SEC; and 

other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented:

(1) The Company expensed certain transaction costs of 1 million and 4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, to general and administrative expenses on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company expensed 3 million of previously capitalized transaction costs during the first quarter of 2023 to general and administrative expenses on our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. The Company considers such costs to be non-recurring in nature. 

(2) Includes a one-time charge of 4 million during the second quarter of 2024, resulting from enacted tax legislation in Canada during June 2024 related to digital services taxes, which requires retrospective application back to January 1, 2022. This amount represents the one-time retrospective liability for the periods prior to April 1, 2024, while all prospective periods are included within Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, this amount includes an estimated accrual for the potential settlement of a regulatory related matter of 10 million, expensed during the first quarter of 2024. These costs are reflected in general and administrative expenses on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Related Party Transactions 
 For information on our relationship with LTRIP, which may be deemed to beneficially own equity securities representing approximately 57 of our voting power as of September 30, 2024, refer to Note 1: Basis of Presentation in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report. We had no related party transactions with LTRIP during both of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 Refer to Note 10: Stock Based Awards and Other Equity Instruments in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report for further information on current year equity award activity, including the issuance of approximately 5.7 million service-based RSUs with a weighted average grant-date fair value of 25.80 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our principal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents balance. Our liquidity needs can also be met through drawdowns under the Credit Facility. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had approximately 1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and 497 million of available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, 216 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our international subsidiaries outside of the U.S., of which approximately 36 was held in the U.K. As of September 30, 2024, the significant majority of our cash was denominated in U.S. dollars. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 556 million of cumulative undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries that are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested. As of September 30, 2024, we maintained a deferred income tax liability on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, which was not material, for the U.S. federal and state income tax and foreign withholding tax liabilities on the cumulative undistributed foreign earnings that we no longer consider indefinitely reinvested. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we are party to a credit agreement Amended Credit Agreement ), which, among other things, provides for a 500 million revolving credit facility Credit Facility with a maturity date of June 29, 2028 (unless, on any date that is 91 days prior to the final scheduled maturity date in respect of any indebtedness outstanding under certain specified debt, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such specified debt is 200 million or more, then the maturity date will be such business day). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. We are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee, at an applicable rate ranging from 0.25 to 0.40 , on the daily unused portion of the Credit Facility for each fiscal quarter and in connection with the issuance of letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, our unused revolver capacity was subject to a commitment fee of 0.25 , given the Company s total net leverage ratio. The Credit Facility, among other things, requires us to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio and contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including for a change of control. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with our covenant requirements in effect under the Credit Facility. While there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the total net leverage ratio covenant in the future, based on our current projections, we do not believe there is a material risk that we will not remain in compliance throughout the next twelve months. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an aggregate outstanding principal amount of 5 million and 832 million in short-term and long-term debt, respectively, pertaining to the 2026 Senior Notes and Term Loan B Facility, both of which are discussed below. 
 In March 2021, the Company completed the sale of 345 million of the 2026 Senior Notes. The 2026 Senior Notes provide, among other things, that interest, at an interest rate of 0.25 per annum, is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, until their maturity on April 1, 2026. The 2026 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, although unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis, by certain of the Company s domestic subsidiaries. 
 On July 8, 2024, under the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company issued a 500 million Term Loan B Facility maturing July 8, 2031, with an interest rate based on secured overnight financing rate SOFR plus 2.75 , payable monthly. On July 15, 2024, the Company used these funds to fully redeem its outstanding 500 million, 2025 Senior Notes. The Term Loan B Facility was offered at 99.75 of par and is required to be paid down at 1.00 of the aggregate principal amount per year, repayable in quarterly installments on the last day of each calendar quarter, commencing December 31, 2024, equal to 0.25 of the original principal amount with the balance due on the maturity date. 
 39 

The 2026 Senior Notes and Term Loan B Facility are not registered securities and there are currently no plans to register these notes as securities in the future. We may from time to time repurchase the 2026 Senior Notes and Term Loan B Facility through tender offers, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. For further information on the Amended Credit Agreement, the Credit Facility, the Term Loan B Facility, 2025 Senior Notes and 2026 Senior Notes, refer to Note 6: Debt in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report. 
 On September 7, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 250 million in shares of our common stock under a share repurchase program. This share repurchase program, which has a term of two years, does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular number of shares and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of outstanding common stock under this share repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 1,366,385 shares of its common stock at an average price of 18.28 per share, exclusive of fees and commissions, or 25 million in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2024, there was 200 million remaining available to repurchase shares of its common stock under this share repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 4,724,729 shares of its common stock at an average price of 15.85 per share, exclusive of fees and commissions, or 75 million in the aggregate, which completed a previous share repurchase program. 
 Our business typically experiences seasonal fluctuations that affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the year related to working capital. As a result of our experience bookings, we generally receive cash from travelers at the time of booking or prior to the occurrence of an experience, and we record these amounts, net of commissions, on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred merchant payables. We pay the experience operator, or the supplier, after the travelers use. Therefore, we generally receive cash from the traveler prior to paying the experience operator and this operating cycle represents a source or use of cash to us. During the first half of the year, experiences bookings typically exceed completed experiences, resulting in higher cash flow related to working capital, while during the second half of the year, particularly in the third quarter, this pattern reverses and cash flows from these transactions are typically negative. Other factors may also impact typical seasonal fluctuations, such as significant shifts in our business mix, adverse economic conditions, public health-related events, as well as other factors that could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends. In addition, new or different payment options offered to our customers could impact the timing of cash flows, such as our Reserve Now, Pay Later payment option, which allows travelers the option to reserve certain experiences and defer payment until a date no later than two days before the experience date. Usage of this payment option may continue to increase, though it is still not used in a majority of bookings to date, and affect the timing of our future cash flows and working capital. 
 As discussed in Note 8: Income Taxes in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report, we received a final notice regarding a MAP resolution agreement for the 2014 through 2016 tax years in January 2024, which we subsequently accepted in February 2024. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we made a payment to the IRS of 141 million, inclusive of estimated interest, and during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made various state tax payments totaling 18 million, inclusive of estimated interest, related to this audit settlement. We anticipate a competent authority refund from a foreign jurisdiction and certain federal tax benefits, net of certain state tax payments due, associated with this IRS audit settlement which will be substantially settled in the next twelve months, resulting in an estimated net cash inflow of 50 million to 60 million, inclusive of related interest. 
 Additionally, as discussed in Note 8: Income Taxes in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report, we received a final notice regarding a MAP settlement for the 2009 through 2011 tax years in January 2023, which the Company subsequently accepted in February 2023. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we made a U.S. federal tax payment of 113 million, inclusive of interest, to Expedia related to this IRS audit settlement, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Expedia. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we received a competent authority refund of 49 million, inclusive of interest income, related to this IRS audit settlement. 
 In addition, in January 2021, we received an issue closure notice from HMRC in the U.K. relating to adjustments for the 2012 through 2016 tax years. These proposed adjustments are related to certain transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries and would result in an increase to income tax expense in an estimated range of 25 million to 35 million, exclusive of interest expense, at the close of the audit if HMRC prevails. Although the ultimate timing for resolution of this matter is uncertain, any future payments required would negatively impact our operating cash flows. 
 We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our foreseeable working capital requirements, capital expenditures, existing business growth initiatives, debt and interest obligations, lease commitments, and other financial commitments through at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements may also include capital needs for acquisitions and/or other expenditures in support of our business strategy, which may potentially reduce our cash balance and/or require us to borrow under the Credit Facility or to seek other financing alternatives.

Our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our primary source of cash was from operations, while our primary use of cash was from financing activities (including repurchases of our outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of 25 million under our existing share repurchase program, payment of withholding taxes on net share settlements of our equity awards of 17 million, and financing costs related to the issuance of our Term Loan B Facility of 7 million) and investing activities (including capital expenditures of 51 million incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024). This use of cash was funded with cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flows during the period. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our primary source of cash was from operations, while our primary use of cash was from financing activities (including repurchases of our outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of 75 million under a previous share repurchase program and payment of withholding taxes on net share settlements of our equity awards of 14 million) and investing activities (including capital expenditures of 47 million incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023).

 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 107 million when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in working capital of 144 million, partially offset by an improvement in net income (loss) of 26 million and an increase in non-cash items of 11 million, primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense. The decrease in working capital was driven primarily by a net increase in U.S. federal and various state tax payments of 80 million, combined with a decrease of 13 million in our income tax provision, both related to the IRS audit settlements, discussed above, when compared to the same period in 2023. Also contributing to the decrease in working capital was a decrease in deferred merchant payables, reflecting the timing of when cash is received from travelers and then remitted to experiences operators. In addition, changes in working capital related to accounts receivable and accounts payable were due to the timing of customer payments and vendor payments, respectively, and contributed to the fluctuation in working capital. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 4 million when compared to the same period in 2023, due to an increase in capital expenditures across the business. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 42 million when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in net cash used to purchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs of 50 million, partially offset by financing costs related to the issuance of our Term Loan B Facility of 7 million in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 There have been no material changes outside the normal course of business to our contractual obligations and commercial commitments since December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, other than our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Annual Report for a discussion of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments. 
 Contingencies 	 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are party to legal, regulatory and administrative matters, including threats thereof, arising out of or in connection with our operations. These matters may involve claims involving patent and other intellectual property rights (including privacy, alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights), tax matters (including value-added, excise, transient occupancy and accommodation taxes), regulatory compliance (including competition, consumer matters and data privacy), contractual disputes (including breach of a covenant or disagreements as to interpretation), defamation and reputational claims. Periodically, we review the status of all significant outstanding matters to assess any potential financial exposure. When (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred; and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
 41 

and is material, we record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of operations. We provide disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both of these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the consolidated financial statements. We base accruals on the best information available at the time which can be highly subjective. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, we do not believe that the final disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, except for certain known income tax matters discussed below. However, the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from our estimates. Finally, there may be claims or actions pending or threatened against us of which we are currently not aware and the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and non-income tax matters. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period for which that determination is made. 
 Refer to Note 8: Income Taxes and Note 9: Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report for further information on other potential contingencies, including ongoing audits by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities, and other tax and legal matters. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD has been developing its two pillar project to address certain perceived tax challenges arising from digitalization of the economy. Many countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will result in significant changes to the international taxation system under which our current income tax obligations are determined. Pillar Two of this project calls for a minimum income tax rate on corporations of 15 and has begun to be implemented by an increasing number of countries. The OECD and implementing countries are expected to continue to offer further guidance on the impact of Pillar Two on their respective local corporate income tax rules, however, such impact for the Company is not expected to be material at this time. The Company will continue to monitor developments to determine any potential impact of Pillar Two in the countries in which we operate. 
 Pillar One, which would reallocate profits from the largest and most profitable businesses to countries where the customers of those businesses are located, remains under discussion at the OECD, and its implementation remains uncertain. If implemented, Pillar One would potentially result in the removal of unilateral digital services tax initiatives, such as those enacted in France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. In July 2023, more than 138 countries and jurisdictions agreed to refrain from imposing newly enacted digital service tax initiatives or similar measures before December 31, 2024, provided the Pillar One negotiations have made sufficient progress by the end of 2023. In December 2023, the OECD Inclusive Framework reaffirmed their commitment to achieve a consensus-based solution and to complete the multilateral agreement by June 2024, thereby extending the standstill on new digital service tax initiatives. The June 2024 extended deadline has since expired, thereby enabling countries to introduce new unilateral digital service taxes. For example, in June 2024, Canada enacted tax legislation related to digital services taxes, which requires retrospective application back to January 1, 2022, resulting in a one-time charge of 4 million during the second quarter of 2024, reflected in general and administrative expenses on our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. We will continue to monitor these developments to determine the financial impact to the Company. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 7 million and 18 million, respectively, of digital service tax, while during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 6 million and 13 million, respectively, of digital service tax to general and administrative expense on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Due to the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits in 2017, as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, the majority of previously unremitted earnings have been subjected to U.S. federal income tax. To the extent future distributions from these subsidiaries will be taxable, a deferred income tax liability has been accrued on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, which was not material as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 556 million of our cumulative undistributed foreign earnings were no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested . 
 I tem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There has been no material change in our market risk profile during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 since December 31, 2023. For additional information about our market risk profile, refer to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Item 7A. in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in stock prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are exposed to market risks primarily due to our international operations, our ongoing investment and financial activities, as 
 42 

well as changes in economic conditions in all significant markets in which we operate. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in our future earnings, cash flows, fair values of our assets, and financial condition. Our exposure to market risk, at any point in time, may include risks related to any borrowings under the Credit Facility, outstanding debt related to the 2026 Senior Notes and Term Loan B Facility, derivative instruments, capped calls, cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, if any, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables/payables, accounts payable, deferred merchant payables and other balances and transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage and attempt to mitigate our exposure to such risks. 
 We expect that we will continue to increase our operations internationally. Our exposure to potentially volatile movements in foreign currency exchange rates will increase as we increase our operations in international markets. The economic impact of foreign currency exchange rate movement is linked to variability in the macroeconomic environment such as inflation and interest rates, governmental actions, and geopolitical events such as regional conflicts. We regularly monitor the macroeconomic environment, which has seen some volatility as a result of geopolitical tensions resulting from Russia s invasion of Ukraine, the escalating conflict in the Middle East, as well as increased cyberattacks, military conflicts and sanctions. Developments in the macroeconomic environment could cause us to adjust our foreign currency risk strategies. Continued uncertainty regarding our international operations and U.K. and E.U. relations may result in future currency exchange rate volatility which may impact our business and results of operations. 
 I tem 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s, or the SEC s, rules and forms, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 I tem 1. Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are party to legal, regulatory and administrative matters, including threats thereof, arising out of, or in connection with our operations. These matters may involve claims involving, but not limited to, intellectual property rights (including privacy rights and alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights), tax matters (including value-added, excise, transient occupancy and accommodation taxes), regulatory compliance (including competition, consumer protection matters and data privacy or cybersecurity matters), contractual claims (including related to our material agreements or other contracts), defamation and reputational claims, personal injury claims, labor and employment matters and commercial disputes. Periodically, we review the status of all significant outstanding matters to assess any potential financial exposure. We record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of operations when (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred; and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated and is material. We provide disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both of these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the consolidated financial statements. We base accruals on the best information available at the time, which can be highly subjective. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, we do not believe that the final disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, except for certain known income tax matters as discussed in Note 8: Income Taxes in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report. However, the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from our estimates. Finally, there may be claims or actions pending or threatened against us of which we are currently not aware and the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 43 

I tem 1A. Risk Factors 
 While we attempt to identify, manage and mitigate risks and uncertainties associated with our business to the extent practical under the circumstances, some level of risk and uncertainty will always be present. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent reports with the SEC for a description of the risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business, results of operations or financial condition. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A., Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 I tem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

 Share Repurchases 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its outstanding common stock.
