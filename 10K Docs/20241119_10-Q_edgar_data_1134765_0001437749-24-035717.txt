Substantial Doubt to Continue as a Going Concern Regarding the Legal and Regulatory Environment, Liquidity and Management s Plan of Operation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company operates in a rapidly changing legal and regulatory environment; new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations could significantly limit the Company s ability to sell its products, and/or result in additional costs. Additionally, the Company was required to obtain approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA to continue selling and marketing certain of products used for the vaporization of nicotine in the United States. Currently, a substantial portion of the Company s sales are derived from products that are subject to approval by the FDA. There was a significant cost associated with the application process and there can be no assurance the FDA will approve previous and/or future applications. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s revenue declined, the Company generated a loss from operations of approximately , and a consolidated net loss of approximately . Cash used in operations was approximately . The Company had a stockholders deficit of at September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s working capital position decreased to a deficit of from as of December 31, 2023. Considering these facts, the issuance of one or several Marketing Denial Orders "MDOs from the FDA would increase the potential for inventory obsolescence and uncollectable accounts receivables and potentially require us to remove products from circulation. These regulatory risks, as well as other industry-specific challenges, our low working capital and cash position remain factors that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our plans and growth depend on our ability to increase revenues, procure cost-effective financing, and continue our business development efforts, including the expenditure of approximately million as of September 30, 2024, to support our premarket tobacco product application PMTA process for the Company s submissions to the FDA. The Company has undergone cost-cutting measures including salary reductions of up to 25 for officers and certain managers and a reduction in headcount for certain departments. The Company may require additional financing in the future to support the development of new product categories as well as subsequent PMTA filings, and/or in the event the FDA requests additional testing for one, or several, of the Company s prior PMTA submissions. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and there can be no assurance that any such arrangement, if required or otherwise sought, would be available on terms deemed to be commercially acceptable and, in the Company s best interests. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amount and classification of recorded assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue operations. If we do not have sufficient funds to continue operations, we could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or other alternatives that would likely result in our stockholders losing some or all their investment in us. 

Risks and Uncertainties 

The Company operates in an environment that is subject to rapid changes and developments in laws and regulations that could have a significant impact on the Company s ability to sell its products. Beginning in September 2019, certain states temporarily banned the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, and several states and municipalities are considering implementing similar restrictions. Federal, state, and local governmental bodies across the United States have indicated that flavored e-cigarette liquid, vaporization products and certain other consumption accessories may become subject to new laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels. In addition, in June 2022, the FDA announced a plan to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes to minimally or non-addictive levels. The application of any new laws or regulations that may be adopted in the future, at a federal, state, or local level, directly or indirectly implicating nicotine, flavored e-cigarette liquid and other electronic nicotine delivery system ENDS products, could significantly limit the Company s ability to sell such products, result in additional compliance expenses, and/or require the Company to change its labeling and/or methods of distribution. Any ban of the sale of flavored e-cigarettes directly limits the markets in which the Company may sell its products. In the event the prevalence of such bans and/or changes in laws and regulations increase across the United States, or internationally, the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, the Company is presently seeking to obtain marketing authorization for certain of its tobacco-derived nicotine e-liquid products. The Company s applications were submitted in September 2020 on a timely basis, which if approved, will allow the Company to continue to sell its approved products in the United States. Beginning in August 2021, the FDA began issuing Marketing Denial Orders MDO for ENDS products that lack evidence to demonstrate that permitting the marketing of such products would be appropriate for the protection of the public health. The Company has not received an MDO for any of its 2020 PMTA submissions; however, there is no assurance that regulatory approval to sell our products will be granted or that Charlie s would be able to raise additional financing if required, which could have a significant impact on our sales. On March 15, 2022, a new rider to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was passed granting the FDA authority over synthetic nicotine. These regulations make the Company s synthetic nicotine products subject to the same FDA rules as tobacco-derived nicotine products. As such, the Company was required to file a PMTA for its existing synthetic nicotine products marketed under the Pacha brands by May 14, 2022 or be subject to FDA enforcement. The Company filed new PMTAs, for its synthetic Pacha products on May 13, 2022, prior to the May 14, 2022 deadline. On November 3, 2022, FDA accepted for scientific review certain of our PMTAs for synthetic nicotine products and, on November 4, 2022, FDA refused to accept certain other PMTAs for these products, rendering the latter products subject to FDA enforcement. The Company pursued an administrative appeal with FDA regarding its refusal to accept certain of the PMTAs. The administrative appeal was granted on October 30, 2023 and the products were accepted to move forward in the PMTA review process. The Company continues to sell the affected products while the PMTA review process continues. The FDA may bring an enforcement action against our synthetic nicotine products for lack of premarket authorization and/or issue an MDO to our pending applications at any time. More generally, FDA s regulatory initiatives and enforcement priorities regarding ENDS products are unpredictable and continue to evolve, and the Company cannot predict whether FDA s priorities and review of our premarket submissions will impact our products to a greater degree than our competitors in the industry. 

During the fourth quarter of 2023 the Company launched new alternative alkaloid disposable vape products, under the SPREE BAR brand. The Company and its attorneys believe Metatine -based alternative alkaloid products are not subject to FDA review. Based on the information provided by the Company s contracted chemical suppliers and its consultants, the proprietary Metatine (patented in the United States and in China by the Company s chemical supplier) in the Company s alternative alkaloid products does not meet the definition of nicotine set forth in 21 U.S.C. 387(12) and therefore its products containing Metatine, as their active ingredient, are not subject to regulation as tobacco products under 21 U.S.C. 321(rr). Further, according to information provided by the Company s chemists, the other ingredients in the Company s alternative alkaloid vape liquid are not made or derived from tobacco, nor do they contain nicotine from any source. The documentary support for these facts, including a Certificate of Analysis COA for the Metatine used in the Company s alternative alkaloid products, corroborates these conclusions. However, should any of these understandings be incorrect, the Company s position on Metatine not meeting the definition of a tobacco product would need to be revisited. Further, should Congress bestow regulatory control over Metatine to the FDA, or should the FDA deem Metatine disposable vape devices tobacco products despite the facts that Metatine is not a salt or complex of nicotine, and is not itself derived from nicotine or tobacco, alternative alkaloid products might then be subject to the FDA tobacco requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement that all newly deemed tobacco products obtain premarket authorization before entering the U.S. market. If this were to happen, the FDA could bring an enforcement action against our Metatine products for lack of premarket authorization. More generally, FDA s regulatory initiatives and enforcement authority regarding our products are unpredictable and continue to evolve and we cannot predict whether FDA s priorities and/or potential jurisdiction over our products will require us to remove our products from the market and to cease selling them.

Immediately prior to, and in connection with, the Share Exchange, Charlie s consummated a private offering of membership interests that resulted in net proceeds to Charlie s of approximately million (the Charlie s Financing ). In conjunction with the Share Exchange, the Company issued to holders of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value per share Series A Preferred ), warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of Common Stock (the Investor Warrants and to its placement agent, Katalyst Securities LLC, warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of Common Stock (the Placement Agent Warrants ). Both the Investor Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants have a five-year term and a strike price of per share. Due to the exercise features of these warrants, they are not considered to be indexed to the Company s own stock and are therefore not afforded equity treatment in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). In accordance with ASC 815, the Company has recorded the Investor Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants as derivative instruments on its consolidated balance sheet. ASC 815 requires derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability and to be measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are reflected in the Company s earnings for each reporting period. 

On April 26, 2024, the Investor Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants expired without being exercised.

Legal Proceedings 

As of the date hereof, the Company is not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, executive officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. From time to time, the Company may be involved in various claims and counterclaims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of the outcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management s time and attention. 

New Executive Employment Agreement 

On June 15, 2023, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Ryan Stump (the New Agreement ). Pursuant to the New Agreement, Mr. Stump will earn a base salary of per year and serve as Chief Operating Officer for a term of two years, renewable on an annual basis unless earlier terminated by the Company or Mr. Stump. In the event that Mr. Stump is terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined therein) or for Good Reason (as defined therein), he will be entitled to receive his base salary and benefits for a period of one year. In the event of a change in control, all unvested equity awards will immediately vest. Notwithstanding his contracted annual salary, to cut costs during a time when the Company is striving to launch the Metatine-based alternative alkaloid product lines, Mr. Stump has elected to reduce his current compensation to the rate of annually. As a point of reference, all the Company s other executives have also elected to reduce their current compensation. It is anticipated that, when financial circumstances permit, executive base salaries will revert to their previous levels. 

if not utilized before 2043. Our ability to utilize these NOLs and tax credit carryforwards may be limited by any ownership changes as described above that have occurred in prior years or that may occur in the future. If we undergo future ownership changes, many of which may be outside of our control, our ability to utilize our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards could be further limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise become unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Additionally, our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards could be limited under state law. For these reasons, even if we attain profitability, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's estimate for income taxes was not determined to be significant, and therefore, is not reflected in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of Charlie s Holdings, Inc. should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report and without audited financial statements and other information presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report . Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Report, and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), including particularly matters set forth under Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of the 2023 Annual Report. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. 

As used in this Report, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, references to the Company , we , us , our , or similar references mean Charlie s Holdings, Inc., its subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entity on a consolidated basis. 

Overview 

The Company s objective is to become a leader in two broad product categories: (i) non-combustible nicotine-related products, and (ii) alternative alkaloid vapor products. Through our Charlie s subsidiary, we formulate, market, and distribute premium, nicotine-based and alternative alkaloid vapor products. Charlie s products are produced through contract manufacturers for sale through select distributors, specialty retailers, and third-party online resellers throughout the United States and in select international markets. 

Operational Plan 

Considering industry-specific hurdles, as well as the potential for future regulatory changes, management has targeted opportunities for growth and has adopted the following operational plan. 

Priority 1: Over the last two years, we initiated a plan and began to invest substantial time and resources to develop various proprietary products and new technologies in order to achieve competitive advantages in the vapor and alternative products marketplace. In conjunction with internal and external research and development resources, we endeavored to identify a nicotine substitute Metatine to be used in lieu of tobacco-based and synthetically derived nicotine. We believe adult consumers will enjoy Metatine alternative alkaloid vapor products in much the same way that they enjoy traditional vapor products. However, because Metatine is not made or derived from tobacco, and because Metatine does not consist of or contain nicotine from any source, the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products does not have jurisdiction to regulate Metatine. Accordingly, if the Company is successful utilizing Metatine in a viable commercial product, such a product would allow us additional flexibility in offering both flavored and non-flavored vapor products to adult consumers looking to transition away from traditional combustible and smokeless tobacco products. 

With the advent of our nicotine substitute Metatine, we plan to continue developing product formats that offer adult consumers a satisfying alternative to traditional nicotine products. The SPREE BAR line of vapor products launched in late 2023; the second-generation Metatine line, SBX Disposables, are launching in Q4 2024. Further, we have recently begun test-marketing Metatine-based e-liquids under the PACHAMAMA PLUS+ trademark. In response to the rapidly emerging new pouch products category in the nicotine products industry, we are also developing a Metatine-based pouch line that could be ready for market as soon as Q1 2025. We recognize the challenges in marketing non-nicotine-based alternative alkaloid products in a market saturated with traditional nicotine products; accordingly, we are committed to continuous improvement of our Metatine-based products in order to satisfy ever-evolving adult consumers demands. 

Priority 2: Since our founding in 2014, Charlie s has created literally hundreds of products that provide adult smokers with a viable means of abandoning cigarettes. Not coincidentally, over the last 10-15 years e-cigarette usage in the United States has grown significantly, and cigarette smoking rates have dropped. Accordingly, tobacco and synthetically derived nicotine vapor products continue to provide significant growth opportunities for Charlie s. In 2021, we launched our synthetic nicotine (not derived from tobacco) Pacha (formerly Pachamama Disposable) product line, which provides access to additional sales channels and broadens our customer base. These innovative product formats continue to represent an extremely important product category for Charlie s and we intend develop new distribution partnerships in order to grow our nicotine disposable business in 2025. 

To date, Charlie s has invested more than 6.5 million on the submission of Premarket Tobacco Applications PMTAs and subsequent amendments to these applications to the FDA. We engaged a team of more than 200 professionals, including doctors, scientists, biostatisticians, data analysts, and numerous contract research organizations to create Charlie s comprehensive PMTA submissions. Notwithstanding Charlie s meaningful and costly regulatory initiatives and despite the fact that hundreds of other companies across the United States invested hundreds of millions of dollars to submit more than 26 million PMTAs to date, the FDA has only authorized 34 tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products and devices. Accordingly, even though former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb described e-cigarettes as far lower on the continuum of risk than combustible cigarettes, fewer than 1 of the PMTA s for e-cigarette products and devices have survived FDA s regulatory gauntlet. 

Nonetheless, we are continuing to seek FDA marketing authorization for certain of both our nicotine vapor products and our synthetic nicotine vapor products. Obtaining one or more marketing orders from the FDA could, we believe, could help to remediate perceived health issues related to vaping, and further position the Company as a trusted, industry leader. 

Priority 3: The Company has begun to develop intellectual property around technologies designed to prevent youth access to nicotine vapor products. Edward Carmines, Ph.D., a member of Charlie s Board of Directors and an accomplished scientist and regulatory affairs expert, is spearheading Charlie's development of patented "age-gating technology" for both Charlie's and potential licensees of the Company. Currently, there is a need for age-gated product technologies that can satisfy or accommodate concerns the FDA has related to under-age youth access in the ENDS market. If our age-gated e-cigarettes-in-development are recognized as "products of merit" by the FDA, Charlie's e-cigarettes could emerge among the select minority of flavored nicotine disposables able to be sold legally in the 8 billion U.S. vapor products market. 

17

Underlining the importance of Charlie s work with age-gating technology are initiatives taken by JUUL Labs, Altria, and R.J. Reynolds, three of the largest competitors in our industry. In July 2023 JUUL announced that it had submitted a PMTA with the FDA for a new e-cigarette device that also included information on novel, data-driven technologies to restrict underage access. JUUL s chief product officer explained, With our next-generation platform, we have designed a technological solution for two public-health problems: improving adult-smoker switching from combustible cigarettes and restricting underage access to vapor products... In the second quarter of 2024, Altria and R.J. Reynolds announced news of their own PMTA submissions to the FDA for mobile applications that verify consumers ages through third-party age verification providers. Similar to the age-gating technology under development at Charlie s, the Big Tobacco company devices include mobile and web-based apps that enable age-verification technology, including device-locking, and real-time product information and usage insights for age-verified consumers with industry-leading data-privacy protections. 

Priority 4 : In order to mitigate FDA regulatory risk in the domestic market and to capture what management continues to believe is a significant commercial opportunity, we have dedicated additional resources to efforts focused on growing our market share internationally. Presently, approximately 16 of our vapor product sales come from the international market and we are well positioned to increase sales in countries where we already have presence and, in additional overseas markets, as we have already built an international distribution platform. 

Risks and Uncertainties and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The Company operates in an environment that is subject to rapid changes and developments in laws and regulations that could have a significant impact on the Company s ability to sell its products. Beginning in September 2019, certain states temporarily banned the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, and several states and municipalities are considering implementing similar restrictions. Federal, state, and local governmental bodies across the United States have indicated that flavored e-cigarette liquid, vaporization products and certain other consumption accessories may become subject to new laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels. In addition, in June 2022, the FDA announced a plan to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes to minimally or non-addictive levels. The application of any new laws or regulations that may be adopted in the future, at a federal, state, or local level, directly or indirectly implicating nicotine, flavored e-cigarette liquid, and other electronic nicotine delivery system ENDS products, could significantly limit the Company s ability to sell such products, result in additional compliance expenses, and/or require the Company to change its labeling and/or methods of distribution. Any ban of the sale of flavored e-cigarettes directly limits the markets in which the Company may sell its products. In the event the prevalence of such bans and/or changes in laws and regulations increase across the United States, or internationally, the Company s business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, the Company is presently seeking to obtain marketing authorization for certain of its tobacco-derived nicotine e-liquid products. The Company s applications were submitted in September 2020 on a timely basis, which if approved, will allow the Company to continue to sell its approved products in the United States. Beginning in August 2021, the FDA began issuing Marketing Denial Orders MDO for ENDS products that lack evidence to demonstrate that permitting the marketing of such products would be appropriate for the protection of the public health. The Company has not received an MDO for any of its 2020 PMTA submissions; however, there is no assurance that regulatory approval to sell our products will be granted or that we would be able to raise additional financing if required, which could have a significant impact on our sales. On March 15, 2022, a new rider to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was passed granting the FDA authority over synthetic nicotine. These regulations make the Company s synthetic nicotine products subject to the same FDA rules as tobacco-derived nicotine products. As such, the Company was required to file a PMTA for its existing synthetic nicotine products marketed under the Pacha brands by May 14, 2022 or be subject to FDA enforcement. The Company filed new PMTAs, for its synthetic Pacha products on May 13, 2022, prior to the May 14, 2022 deadline. On November 3, 2022, FDA accepted for scientific review certain of our PMTAs for synthetic nicotine products and, on November 4, 2022, FDA refused to accept certain other PMTAs for these products, rendering the latter products subject to FDA enforcement. The Company submitted an administrative appeal with FDA regarding its refusal to accept certain of the PMTAs. The administrative appeal was granted on October 30, 2023 and the products were accepted to move forward in the PMTA review process. The Company continues to sell the affected synthetic nicotine products while the PMTA review process continues. The FDA may bring an enforcement action against our synthetic nicotine products for lack of premarket authorization and/or issue an MDO to our pending applications at any time. More generally, FDA s regulatory initiatives and enforcement priorities regarding ENDS products are unpredictable and continue to evolve, and we cannot predict whether FDA s priorities and review of our premarket submissions will impact our products to a greater degree than our competitors in the industry. In the event the FDA denies our PMTAs, we would be required to remove products and cease selling them. 

The Company recently launched new alternative alkaloid Metatine-based disposable vape products, initially under the SPREE BAR brand, that the Company expects will (i) replace most of its legacy products and (ii) become the single largest, most important commercial opportunity in Charlie s history. The Company and its attorneys believe Metatine-based products are not subject to FDA review. Based on the information provided by the Company s contracted chemical suppliers and its consultants, the proprietary Metatine (patented in the United States and in China by the Company s chemical supplier) in the Company s alternative alkaloid products does not meet the definition of nicotine set forth in 21 U.S.C. 387(12) and therefore its products containing Metatine, as their active ingredient, are not subject to regulation as tobacco products under 21 U.S.C. 321(rr). Further, according to information provided by the Company s chemists, the other ingredients in the Company s alternative alkaloids vape liquid are not made or derived from tobacco, nor do they contain nicotine from any source. The documentary support for these facts, including a Certificate of Analysis (COA) for the Metatine used in the Company s alternative alkaloid products, corroborates these conclusions. However, should any of these understandings be incorrect, the Company s position on Metatine not qualifying as a tobacco product would need to be revisited. Further, should Congress bestow regulatory control over Metatine to the FDA, or should the FDA deem Metatine disposable vape devices tobacco products despite the facts that Metatine is not a salt or complex of nicotine, and is not itself derived from nicotine or tobacco, Metatine-based products might then be subject to the FDA tobacco requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement that all newly deemed tobacco products obtain premarket authorization before entering the U.S. market. If this were to happen, the FDA could bring an enforcement action against our Metatine products for lack of premarket authorization. More generally, FDA s regulatory initiatives and enforcement authority regarding our products are unpredictable and continue to evolve and we cannot predict whether FDA s priorities and/or potential jurisdiction over our products will require us to remove our products from the market and to cease selling them.

As discussed below, our financial statements and working capital raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information.

Revenue 

Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by approximately 1,082,000 or 40.0 , to approximately 1,624,000, as compared to approximately 2,706,000 for same period in 2023 due to a 824,000 decrease in sales of our nicotine-based vapor products, and a 258,000 decrease in sales of our hemp-derived products. The decrease in our nicotine-based vapor product sales was primarily driven by decreased sales of our Pacha Disposable line as well as periodic stockouts of our e-liquid products. The launch of the Company s Metatine-based line of nicotine substitute vapor products required enhanced focus and resource allocation in order to support sales and marketing efforts, which ultimately affected the sales performance of other product categories. Metatine-based product sales have been inconsistent since being launched in late 2023 which has caused a gap in overall sales production. In addition, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 the Company began allocating resources to its new SBX product series which is an enhanced version of the SPREE Bar line of alternative alkaloid vapor products. 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue, which consists of direct costs of materials, direct labor, third party subcontractor services, and other overhead costs decreased by approximately 615,000 or 38.2 , to approximately 994,000, or 61.2 of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 1,609,000, or 59.5 of revenue, for the same period in 2023. This cost, as a percent of revenue, increased compared to last year due to a high sales mix of Metatine-based products which contain a higher per unit cost relative to sales. Lower overhead cost absorption also contributed to a higher cost of revenue as a percent of sales. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 177,000 to 1,420,000 as compared to approximately 1,597,000 for the same period in 2023. This change was primarily due to decreases of approximately 190,000 in non-commission payroll and benefits costs, 36,000 in information systems costs and 32,000 of other general and administrative costs, but was offset by an increase of 81,000 in certain professional fees. The decrease in payroll and benefits costs was primarily driven by elective salary reductions for executives and a reduced bonus accrual. Reduced information systems costs were the result of a company-wide cost-cutting effort. The decrease in other general and administrative costs was primarily due to lower insurance costs and merchant processing fees. Increased professional fees resulted from increased legal and stock-based compensation during the period. 

Sales and Marketing Expense 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total sales and marketing expense decreased by approximately 32,000 to approximately 169,000 as compared to approximately 201,000 for the same period in 2023, which was primarily due to reduced marketing and commission costs during the period. 

Research and Development Expense 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had income from research and development of approximately 83,000 as compared to an expense of 41,000 for the same period in 2023. The decrease of approximately 124,000 was primarily due to a vendor refund of approximately 109,000. 

Loss from Operations 

We incurred a loss from operations of approximately 876,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to loss of approximately 742,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to lower sales and gross profit. We also incurred certain non-cash, general and administrative expenses during the period including a 57,000 expense related to stock-based compensation. Net loss is determined by adjusting loss from operations by the following items: 

Interest Expense. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we recorded approximately 81,000 and 102,000 of related party interest expense. For the same periods, we recorded total interest expense related to notes payable of 146,000 and 121,000, respectively. The increase was primarily due to 1,028,000 of notes payable that were entered in September 2024.

Net Loss 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 1,022,000 as compared to net loss of 708,000 for the same period in 2023. 

Results of Operations for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine months ended September 30, 2023 

Regarding results from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenue of approximately 6,718,000, as compared to revenue of 10,706,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This 3,988,000 decrease in revenue was due primarily to a 2,758,000 decrease in sales of our nicotine-based vapor products, as well as a 1,230,000 decrease in sales of our hemp-derived products. 

We generated a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of approximately 3,034,000 as compared to a net loss of 2,066,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes a non-cash gain in fair value of derivative liabilities of 79,000 compared to a non-cash gain in fair value of derivative liabilities of 563,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Revenue 

Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by approximately 3,988,000 or 37.3 , to approximately 6,718,000, as compared to approximately 10,706,000 for same period in 2023 due to a 2,758,000 decrease in sales of our nicotine-based vapor products, and a 1,230,000 decrease in sales of our hemp-derived products. The decrease in our nicotine-based vapor product sales was primarily driven by decreased sales of our Pacha Disposable line as well as reduced demand for our e-liquid products. The launch of the Company s Metatine-based lines of nicotine substitute vapor products required enhanced focus and resource allocation in order to support sales and marketing efforts, which ultimately affected the sales performance of other product categories. 

The decrease in sales for our hemp-derived business during the period was directly related to the diversion of working capital and other resources towards the ramp up of our Metatine-based lines of nicotine substitute vapor products. 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue, which consists of direct costs of materials, direct labor, third party subcontractor services, and other overhead costs decreased by approximately 2,261,000 or 34.1 , to approximately 4,366,000, or 65.0 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 6,627,000, or 61.9 of revenue, for the same period in 2023. This cost, as a percent of revenue, increased compared to last year due to a high sales mix of SPREE BAR products which contain a higher per unit cost relative to sales. Lower overhead cost absorption also contributed to a higher cost of revenue as a percent of sales. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 972,000 to 4,388,000 as compared to approximately 5,360,000 for the same period in 2023. This change was primarily due to decreases of approximately 600,000 in non-commission payroll and benefits costs, 117,000 in information systems costs, 77,000 in merchant processing fees and approximately 178,000 in other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in payroll and benefits costs was primarily driven by elective salary reductions for executives and reduced headcount. Decreased information systems costs were the result of a company-wide cost-cutting effort during the period. The decrease in merchant processing fees was directly the result of reduced sales activity during the period. The reduction in other general and administrative expenses largely consisted of decreases in bad debt, insurance costs and professional fees. 

Sales and Marketing Expense 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total sales and marketing expense decreased by approximately 268,000 to approximately 620,000 as compared to approximately 888,000 for the same period in 2023, which was primarily due to reduced marketing efforts and commission costs during the period. 

Research and Development Expense 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had income from research and development of approximately 103,000 as compared to an expense of 132,000 for the same period in 2023. The decrease of approximately 235,000 was primarily due to reduced costs associated with the development of new technologies and product formats as well as a vendor refund of approximately 136,000 

Loss from Operations 

We incurred a loss from operations of approximately 2,553,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to loss of approximately 2,301,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to lower sales and gross profit. We also incurred certain non-cash, general and administrative expenses during the period including a 173,000 expense related to stock-based compensation. Net loss is determined by adjusting loss from operations by the following items: 

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the gain in fair value of derivative liabilities was 79,000, compared to a gain in fair value of derivative liabilities of 563,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The derivative liability is associated with the Investor Warrants and the Placement Agent Warrants (as defined in Note 3 of this Report) in connection with the Share Exchange. The gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the expiration of the warrants in April 2024 which resulted in the warrant liability being written off. 

Interest Expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we recorded approximately 273,000 and 166,000 of related party interest expense. For the same periods, we recorded total interest expense related to notes payable of 485,000 and 363,000, respectively. The increase was primarily due to 1,028,000 of notes payable that were entered in September 2024. 

Debt Extinguishment (Loss) Gain. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded approximately 75,000 of loss from debt extinguishment, which was related to our May 2024 Capital Raise (see Note 10). The gain in 2023 resulted from a modification to the promissory note issued to Michael King, a significant shareholder and member of the Company s Board of Directors, which extended the maturity date to March 2025. 

22

Net Loss 

For nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 3,034,000 as compared to a net loss of 2,066,000 for the same period in 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital deficit of approximately 1,392,000, which consisted of current assets of approximately 3,936,000 and current liabilities of approximately 5,328,000, as compared to working capital of approximately 332,000 at December 31, 2023. The current liabilities include approximately 2,686,000 of accounts payable and accrued expenses, notes payable of 901,000, notes payable from related parties of 1,518,000, approximately 108,000 of deferred revenue associated with product shipped but not yet received by customers, and approximately 115,000 of current lease liabilities. 

Our cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30, 2024 was approximately 601,000. As of September 30, 2024, we have the following notes outstanding: 

July 2023 Note Financing . Between July 17, 2023 and August 1, 2023, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes (the Notes to several of its executives and employees, Ryan Stump, Henry Sicignano III, Keith Stump, and Jessica Greenwald, and to three of its largest stockholders, Brandon Stump, Red Beard Holdings LLC, and Michael King (the Lenders" ), in the cumulative principal amount of 1,400,000. Notes bear interest at twenty-one percent (21 per annum and have maturity dates ranging from November 17, 2023 to December 10, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, 400,000, plus accrued interest, remained outstanding and the maturity dates of the outstanding notes have been extended to December 31, 2024. 

April 2022 Note Financing . On April 6, 2022, the Company issued a secured promissory note (the Note to one of its individual stockholders, and a member of the Company s Board of Directors since June 13, 2023, Michael King (the Lender" ), in the principal amount of 1,000,000, which Note is secured by accounts receivable of the Company pursuant to the terms of a Security Agreement entered into by and between the Company and the Lender (the "Note Financing" ). The Note initially required the payment of principal in full and guaranteed interest in an amount the greater of 18 per annum, or 90,000, on or before the earlier date of (i) a Liquidity Event, as defined under the terms of the Note; or (ii) September 28, 2022. On September 28, 2022, the Company and the Lender entered into a modification to the Note to extend the maturity date to March 28, 2023 and the Company paid all accrued interest under the Note through such date. 

On March 28, 2023, the Company entered into a second modification to the Note to extend the maturity date to April 28, 2024, contingent upon the payment of all interest accrued under the Note through March 28, 2023 and certain other modifications to the Note. Principal shall be payable on the 28th day of each month in installments of 25,000, commencing April 28, 2023, continuing up to and including April 28, 2024 whereby a balloon payment for the remaining principal balance will be paid. Immediately following the second modification, the Company entered into a third modification agreement to further extend the maturity date to March 28, 2025. The third modification agreement was effective on March 28, 2023 and superseded the second modification. Interest shall accrue on the aggregate outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to 20 simple interest per annum and shall be payable on the same day as installments of principal are payable. The Company may prepay all or any portion of the principal amount, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, at any time without premium or penalty. All outstanding principal and interest are due earlier of March 28, 2025, or a liquidity event. The third modification was recognized as a debt extinguishment, resulting in a gain on debt extinguishment of approximately 35,000. The Company used the proceeds from the Note for general corporate purposes, and its working capital requirements, pending the availability of alternative debt financing. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 827,000 of principal remained outstanding. 

On May 31, 2024, as part of the May 2024 capital raise (see Note 10), the Lender converted his next four debt repayments for the period from June to September 2024 for a total amount of 100,000 in lieu of cash payment for the subscription agreement.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was approximately 736,000, resulting from a net loss of 2,066,000, offset by a change in operating assets and liabilities of 1,157,000 and net non-cash activity of 173,000. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated approximately 1,478,000 in cash from financing activities related to the issuance of common shares of 1,030,000, notes payable of 742,000, notes payable to a related party of 500,000 and the repayment of 795,000 in notes payable, including 50,000 to a related party. 

Substantial Doubt to Continue as a Going Concern Regarding the Legal and Regulatory Environment, Liquidity and Management s Plan of Operation 

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company operates in a rapidly changing legal and regulatory environment; new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations could significantly limit the Company s ability to sell its products, and/or result in additional costs. Additionally, the Company was required to apply for FDA approval to continue selling and marketing its products used for the vaporization of nicotine in the United States. Currently, a substantial portion of the Company s sales are derived from products that are subject to approval by the FDA. There was a significant cost associated with the application process and there can be no assurance the FDA will approve previous and/or future applications. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s revenue declined, the Company generated a loss from operations of approximately 2,553,000, and a consolidated net loss of approximately 3,034,000. Cash used in operations was approximately 1,244,000. The Company had a stockholders deficit of 1,262,000 at September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s working capital position decreased to a deficit of 1,392,000 from 332,000 as of December 31, 2023. Considering these facts, the issuance of one or several Marketing Denial Orders "MDOs from the FDA would increase the potential for inventory obsolescence and uncollectable accounts receivables and the removal of certain products for sale. These regulatory risks, as well as other industry-specific challenges and our low working capital and cash position, remain factors that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our plans and growth depend on our ability to increase revenues, procure cost-effective financing, and continue our business development efforts, including cumulative expenditures of approximately 6.5 million as of September 30, 2024, to support our PMTA process for the Company s submissions to the FDA. The Company has undergone cost-cutting measures including salary reductions of up to 25 for officers and certain managers and a reduction in headcount for certain departments. The Company may require additional financing in the future to support the development of new product categories as well as subsequent PMTA filings, and/or in the event the FDA requests additional testing for one, or several, of the Company s prior PMTA submissions. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and there can be no assurance that any such arrangement, if required or otherwise sought, would be available on terms deemed to be commercially acceptable and, in the Company s best interests. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amount and classification of recorded assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue operations. If we do not have sufficient funds to continue operations, we could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or other alternatives that would likely result in our stockholders losing some or all their investment in us. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease commitments. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expense in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. The critical accounting estimates that affect the consolidated financial statements and the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with those described under Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on the 2023 Annual Report.

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Report. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based on our evaluation, our President, the principal executive officer, and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

As of the date hereof, we are not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, executive officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. From time to time, the Company may be involved in various claims and counterclaims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of the outcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management s time and attention. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Our results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties described in the 2023 Annual Report. In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part 1, Item 1A, of the 2023 Annual Report and subsequent reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act which could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and our ability to conduct business as expected. The risks described in our 2023 Annual Report and in our subsequent reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management, or that management presently believes not to be material, may also result in material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
