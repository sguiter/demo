In the opinion of management, these condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal, recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for a full year. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated for purposes of preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, certain reclassifications of prior period balances have been made to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported net loss.

 Balance at September 30, 2024 

We currently do not have any contract assets or non-current contract liabilities. Our contract liability as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is included in other current liabilities on the applicable condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our performance obligations for our product and services revenues are typically satisfied before the customer s payment; however, prepayments may occasionally be required. revenue was recognized from the contract liability balance for the three months ended September 2024 and million of revenue was recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . There was less than million in revenue recognized from the contract liability balance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Practical Expedient 
 
 We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations when the related contract has a duration of one year or less. We recognize revenue equal to what we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date.

Employee receivables primarily consist of amounts paid by us for foreign withholding tax paid on behalf of employees working on international assignments, which is expected to be reimbursed to us by the employees when refunded as foreign tax credits on their home-country tax returns. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , a component of the other receivables balance is million related to a company-owned life insurance policy associated with a non-qualified deferred compensation plan which was terminated in late 2023. We expect to utilize the proceeds from the liquidation of the insurance policy to fund the disbursements to settle liabilities under the terminated plan during the fourth quarter of 2024. The associated liabilities of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are included in other current liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the other receivables balance at September 30, 2024 includes million associated with a technical services and assistance agreement with our partner in Oman, and a corresponding balance at December 31, 2023 of million, net of withholding tax, which was collected in the second quarter of 2024.

We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. We determined there were no triggering events that indicated potential impairment of our property and equipment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , and accordingly impairment loss has been recorded. 

Accumulated impairment 
 Net 

We perform an annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of December 31, or whenever there is a triggering event that indicates an impairment loss may have been incurred. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we did not identify any triggering events for Repeat Precision, our only reportable unit with goodwill, that would indicate potential impairment. Therefore, goodwill impairment has been recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 .

Total amortization expense, which is associated with selling, general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations, was million for e ach of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 
 
 Identifiable intangibles are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we evaluated potential triggering events and determined that there were no triggering events which indicated potential impairment of our intangibles, which are substantially related to our Repeat Precision asset group. Therefore, we did not record any impairment charges related to our identifiable intangibles for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 

Property and franchise taxes accrual 
 Severance and other termination benefits 
 Accrued other miscellaneous liabilities 
 Total accrued expenses 

As previously disclosed in our Annual Report, we implemented certain restructuring efforts during 2023 to streamline our tracer diagnostics operations in the United States, consolidate Repeat Precision facilities in Mexico, and eliminate redundancies in the structure of certain U.S. and international operations management and support functions. In addition, in July 2023, an executive officer and NCS agreed that he would leave his position. In connection with these restructuring efforts, we incurred severance and other charges of million in 2023, a portion of which was associated with the acceleration of non-cash share-based compensation. Of this amount, we paid million in 2023 and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , with no remaining severance and other termination benefits accrual associated with these restructuring efforts. 
 
 In June 2024, we entered into a sublease agreement as the lessor for a portion of the space vacated when a U.S. facility was closed through our 2023 restructuring efforts. The sublease covers the remaining 28 months of the lease term. We will apply the sublease rental income to offset the operating lease expense associated with this facility.

The estimated fair value of total debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. The fair value of the finance leases was estimated using Level 2 inputs by calculating the sum of the discounted future interest and principal payments at our incremental borrowing rate through the date of maturity. 

Below is a description of our financing arrangements. 
 
 ABL Facility 
 
 On May 3, 2022, we entered into a secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Facility ), where credit availability is subject to a borrowing base calculation. The ABL Facility is governed by the Credit Agreement dated as of May 3, 2022, by and between NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. NCSH ), Pioneer Investment, Inc. Pioneer ), NCS Multistage, LLC, NCS Multistage Inc. NCS Canada ), the other loan parties thereto, the lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and as a lender under the facility provided therein (the Credit Agreement ). Concurrent with the entry into our Credit Agreement on May 3, 2022, our prior ABL facility was terminated. On April 16, 2024, we amended the Credit Agreement to modify the benchmark that may be used for loans in Canadian dollars in connection with the cessation of the CDOR Rate and transition to the CORRA Rate. 
 
 The ABL Facility is a revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of million, of which up to million can be made in Canadian dollars and million can be available for letters of credit. Total borrowings available to the borrowers under the ABL Facility may be limited subject to a borrowing base calculated on the sum of cash in a specified pledged account, eligible accounts receivables and eligible inventory, provided it does not include the assets of Repeat Precision. Our available borrowing base under the ABL Facility as of September 30, 2024 was million. The ABL Facility will mature on May 3, 2027. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had outstanding indebtedness under the ABL Facility. 
 
 Borrowings under the ABL Facility may be made in U.S. dollars with interest calculated using either the ABR , the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR or the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate , and in Canadian dollars with interest calculated using the Canadian Prime Rate or the Adjusted Term CORRA Rate (each as defined in the amended and restated Credit Agreement). Borrowings bear interest plus a margin that varies depending on our leverage ratio as follows: (i) for ABR based loans, between and , and (ii) for Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR, Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, Canadian Prime Rate, and Adjusted Term CORRA Rate, between and . We must also pay a commitment fee calculated at to per annum, based on unused commitments. The applicable interest rate at September 30, 2024 was . We incurred interest expense related to the ABL Facility, including commitment fees, of less than million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , and million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 The obligations of the borrowers under the ABL Facility are guaranteed by NCSH and each of our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries (other than Repeat Precision), as well as each of our future direct and indirect subsidiaries organized under the laws of the United States or Canada (subject to certain exceptions), and are secured by substantially all of the assets of NCSH and its subsidiaries, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. 
 
 The Credit Agreement requires, as a condition to borrowing, that available cash on hand after borrowings does not exceed million. The Credit Agreement also requires us to (i) maintain, for quarters during which liquidity is less than of the aggregate revolving commitments, a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to 1.0 and (ii) to prepay advances to the extent that the outstanding loans and letter of credit amounts exceed the most recently calculated borrowing base. As of September 30, 2024 , we were in compliance with these financial covenants. The Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, dividends and other restricted payments, dispositions and transactions with affiliates. 
 
 The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default for facilities of this type (with customary materiality thresholds and grace periods, as applicable). If an event of default occurs, the lenders party to the Credit Agreement may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings under such facility, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders party to the Credit Agreement also have the right upon an event of default thereunder to terminate any commitments to provide further borrowings, or to provide additional financing in excess of the borrowing base limit, or to proceed against the collateral securing the ABL Facility. 
 
 We capitalized direct costs of million in connection with the Credit Agreement, and less than million associated with the April 2024 amendment, each of which is being amortized over the remaining term of the ABL Facility using the straight-line method. Amortization of the deferred financing charges of million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , and million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , was included in interest expense, net. 
 
 Repeat Precision Promissory Note 
 
 On February 16, 2018, Repeat Precision entered into a promissory note with Security State Bank Trust, Fredericksburg (the Repeat Precision Promissory Note ). The Repeat Precision Promissory Note had been renewed several times. In May 2024, the Repeat Precision Promissory Note was again renewed with a reduced aggregate borrowing capacity of million. The Repeat Precision Promissory Note is scheduled to mature on May 10, 2025 and bears interest at a variable interest rate based on prime plus . The applicable interest rate at September 30, 2024 was . The Repeat Precision Promissory Note is collateralized by certain equipment, inventory and receivables of Repeat Precision. Total borrowings may be limited subject to a borrowing base calculation, which includes a portion of Repeat Precision s eligible receivables, inventory and equipment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was outstanding indebtedness under the promissory note. Repeat Precision s indebtedness is guaranteed by Repeat Precision and is not guaranteed by any other NCS entity. 
 
 Finance Leases 
 
 We lease assets under finance lease arrangements, including an office and laboratory in Tulsa, Oklahoma, facilities in Odessa, Texas, and certain operating equipment and software. We also maintain a vehicle leasing arrangement with a fleet management company where we lease light vehicles and trucks that meet the finance lease criteria. 

million. During 2023, we accrued million which included this judgment amount and estimated court costs, less million previously paid to the plaintiff by our insurance carrier. During the fourth quarter of 2023, in connection with entering into a settlement agreement, we reversed the accrual for this legal contingency of million. As of December 31, 2023, because we had entered into a settlement agreement where the insurance carrier agreed to pay all amounts due to the plaintiff in early 2024, we recorded an insurance receivable for expected but unpaid insurance recoveries and a remaining provision for legal contingencies of million. The settlement was fully paid by the insurance carrier in January 2024. 
 
 Wyoming Matter 
 
 NCS was a defendant in a lawsuit in a state district court in Wyoming, which settled in August 2023 the Wyoming Matter ). The claim related to an alleged service issue by our personnel during completions operations. The parties agreed to a settlement that included a payment to the plaintiff of million, which was paid on NCS s behalf under a policy of insurance and NCS received million as reimbursement of unpaid invoices from the plaintiff. During the second quarter of 2023, we accrued a provision for the Wyoming Matter of million which represented our best estimate of loss at the time, within the range of possible outcomes. In the third quarter of 2023, we reversed this provision for the Wyoming Matter as it was settled and paid by our insurance company.

 On July 24, 2018, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit seeking unspecified damages against Kobold Corporation, Kobold Completions Inc. and 2039974 Alberta Ltd. Kobold in the Federal Court of Canada Canada Court ), alleging that Kobold s fracturing tools and methods infringe on several of our Canadian patents. On July 12, 2019, Kobold filed a counterclaim seeking unspecified damages alleging that our fracturing tools and methods infringe on their patent. The patent infringement litigation against Kobold and their counterclaim was heard in early 2022. 
 
 On October 10, 2023, the judge rendered a decision against us holding that our asserted patents are invalid and that we are infringing the Kobold asserted patent. The Canada Court ordered us to pay Kobold approximately million million in Canadian dollars) in costs and disbursements, including taxes payable thereon, and granted an injunction prohibiting us from any further infringement of the specified patent. We paid this amount to Kobold in November 2023. 
 
 We believe that applicable law supports strong grounds to appeal the decision by the Canada Court as well as to reduce the costs award significantly. We have appealed the judgment and believe we have strong arguments that may lead to a reversal of substantial portions of the decision, although a loss may be reasonably possible. We expect the appeal to be heard by early 2025, and a decision granted by late 2025. If we do not prevail in the appeal phase, the damages portion would then be decided by the Canada Court and we do not know what damages, if any, will be awarded to Kobold. We would expect any damages awarded to be more modest because of the relative ease and minimal cost in implementing changes to our product to comply with the injunction, with such changes resulting in no significant commercial impact to date. In July 2024, Kobold filed a motion with the Canada Court regarding the scope of the injunction. If the Canada Court agrees with Kobold, it may impose a fine or other remedy against the Company. 
 
 On April 6, 2020, Kobold filed a separate patent infringement lawsuit seeking unspecified damages against us in the Canada Court, alleging that our fracturing tools infringe on their Canadian patents. We believe we have strong arguments of invalidity and non-infringement in this matter. This patent infringement litigation has not yet been assigned a trial date. 

Other Patent Matters 

In connection with our patent infringement jury verdict against Nine Energy Services, Inc. Nine ), in January 2022 in the Western District of Texas, Waco Division Waco District Court the jury awarded NCS approximately million in damages for Nine s infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,465,445 the 445 Patent ). In addition, in August 2022 in connection with the patent infringement jury verdict against TCO AS ("TCO"), the jury awarded NCS approximately million in damages for TCO s infringement of the 445 Patent. At a hearing for the Nine and TCO cases, in December 2022 and May 2024, respectively, the Waco District Court announced it would be awarding supplemental damages, interest, and costs and ordered Nine and TCO to pay an ongoing royalty for the sale of infringing casing flotation devices for the life of the 445 Patent. In total, Nine and TCO have secured over million to date for the amounts owed in connection with the judgment and have appealed their respective decisions, with a resolution expected in 2026. As the decisions are subject to appeal, we have not recorded any potential gain contingencies associated with these matters in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

In accordance with GAAP, we accrue for contingencies where the occurrence of a material loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our legal contingencies may increase or decrease, on a matter-by-matter basis, to account for future developments. Although the outcome of any legal proceeding cannot be predicted with any certainty, our assessment of the likely outcome of litigation matters is based on our judgment of a number of factors, including experience with similar matters, past history, precedents, relevant financial information and other evidence and facts specific to each matter. 
 
 Operating Leases 
 
 In October 2024, Repeat Precision entered into a new six year operating lease for an existing manufacturing plant in Ojinaga, Mexico, with a three -year renewal option. In October, we will record an operating lease right of use asset and corresponding liability of million for this lease. In addition, in October 2024, we entered into an operating lease for a sales facility in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, with a term of months, and will record a right of use asset and corresponding liability of million. 

equity-classified restricted stock units RSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value of to the nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. The RSUs granted to the members of our Board of Directors generally vest on the one -year anniversary of the grant date and either settle at vesting or, if the director has elected to defer the RSUs, within thirty days following the earlier of the termination of the director s service for any reason or a change of control. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we granted equivalent stock units, or cash-settled, liability-classified RSUs ESUs ), with a weighted average grant date fair value of . When ESUs are granted to employees, they are valued at fair value, which we measure at the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Since ESUs will be settled in cash, we record a liability, which is remeasured each reporting period at fair value based upon the closing price of our common stock until the awards are settled. The ESUs generally vest and settle over a period of three equal annual installments beginning on or around the anniversary of the date of grant. The cash settled for any ESU will not exceed the maximum payout established by our Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 
 In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we granted performance stock unit awards PSUs ), which have a performance period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026. The PSUs grant date fair value of was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation. The number of PSUs ultimately issued under the program is dependent upon our total shareholder return relative to a performance peer group relative TSR over the three year performance period. Each PSU associated with the March 2024 award will settle for between zero and shares of our common stock in the first quarter of 2027. The threshold performance level 25th percentile relative TSR) earns 50 of the target PSUs, the mid-point performance level 50th percentile relative TSR) earns 100 of the target PSUs and the maximum performance level 75th percentile relative TSR) or greater earns 125 of the target PSUs. 
 
 Total share-based compensation expense for all awards was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 

and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax (benefit) expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily relates to results generated by our United States, Canada, and certain other foreign businesses. The income tax provision for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , does not include the effects of losses within the United States, Canada, or other jurisdictions, from which we cannot currently benefit. In addition, for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the income tax provision includes effects of changes in valuation allowances established against our previously recognized deferred tax assets derived from net operating loss carryforwards, in the United States, Canada, or other jurisdictions. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , due to the impact of the valuation allowances on tax expense, significant variations exist in the customary relationship between income tax expense and pretax accounting income.

 Overview and Outlook 
 
 We are a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well construction, well completions and field development strategies. We provide our products and services primarily to exploration and production E P companies for use in onshore and offshore wells, predominantly wells that have been drilled with horizontal laterals in both unconventional and conventional oil and natural gas formations. Our products and services are utilized in oil and natural gas basins throughout North America and in selected international markets, including the North Sea, the Middle East, Argentina and China. We provide our products and services to various customers, including leading large independent oil and natural gas companies and major oil companies. 
 
 Our primary offering is our fracturing systems products and services, which enable efficient pinpoint stimulation: the process of individually stimulating each entry point into a formation targeted by an oil or natural gas well. Our fracturing systems products and services can be used in both cemented and open-hole wellbores and enable our customers to precisely place stimulation treatments in a more controlled and repeatable manner as compared with traditional completion techniques. Our fracturing systems products and services are utilized in conjunction with third-party providers of pressure pumping, coiled tubing and other services. As an extension of fracturing systems, we offer enhanced recovery systems, which enable our customers to inject water, other fluids, or gases in a controlled manner with the objective of increasing the number of hydrocarbons produced from their assets. 
 
 We own a 50 interest in Repeat Precision, LLC Repeat Precision ), which sells composite frac plugs, perforating guns and related products. We provide tracer diagnostics services for well completion and reservoir characterization that utilize downhole chemical and radioactive tracers. We sell products for well construction, including casing buoyancy systems, liner hanger systems and toe initiation sleeves. We operate in one reportable segment that has been identified based on how our chief operating decision maker manages our business. 
 
 Our products and services are primarily sold to North American E P companies and our ability to generate revenues from our products and services depends upon oil and natural gas drilling and completion activity in North America. Oil and natural gas drilling and completion activity is directly influenced by oil and natural gas prices. 
 
 Based on E P company activity to date and expected capital budgets for the remainder of 2024, as well as more recent industry reports, we believe that annual average industry drilling and completion activity in Canada will be approximately 5 higher compared to 2023. In the United States, we expect a decline in activity by 10 to 15 on average compared to 2023 due in part to reduced natural gas prices and E P consolidation. International industry activity is expected to improve slightly as compared to 2023. 
 
 Oil and natural gas prices were volatile in 2023, and this volatility continued into 2024 due to unrest from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the Israeli conflicts with Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran (the "Israeli Conflicts"). If the Israeli Conflicts further escalate in the Middle East, commodity prices could be more volatile. In addition, oil prices have been affected by a decline in global oil demand growth, particularly from China. To mitigate the impact of uncertain economic conditions on the oil market, certain countries continue to extend voluntary crude oil output cuts and maintain spare capacity, enabling the producers to adjust production levels relatively quickly. However, in December 2024, these production cuts are expected to decrease, and Saudi Arabia has indicated it will increase oil output, shifting away from its previous strategy of maintaining higher prices. See further discussion below on oil and natural gas pricing. 
 
 We continue to face intense competitive pressure across all of our product and services offerings, which has and may continue to have a negative impact on market share and operating margins for certain product lines. Furthermore, this competitive pressure constrains our ability to raise prices in an inflationary environment, which was more pronounced in early to mid-2023 but has since improved. 
 
 Over the past two years, we have experienced modest supply chain disruptions and higher prices for certain raw materials, including steel and chemicals, as well as purchased components and outsourced services. This cost inflation persisted throughout 2022, continued into 2023, then moderated somewhat in 2024. Prices for steel have declined from their highs as U.S. rig counts have decreased. While we have endeavored to increase customer prices to defray our higher raw material and component costs, these price increases have not always fully offset our higher input costs. We also experienced tight labor conditions starting in 2022, which has led to increased employee turnover, delays in filling open positions and labor cost inflation, which impacted both our cost of sales and selling, general and administrative SG A expenses and resulted in higher salaries, hourly pay rates and benefit costs. This labor cost inflation, while still elevated, began to decrease during the latter part of 2023. 
 
 To counter inflationary pressures on the economy, central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, increased reference interest rates several times between March 2022 and July 2023, actions typically expected to increase borrowing costs and restrain economic activity. In September 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve decreased the benchmark interest rate amid favorable inflation and job data, and more rate cuts are possible later in 2024 and 2025.

Market Conditions 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Drilling and Completion Activity 
 
 Oil and natural gas prices remain volatile. The average WTI crude oil price decreased slightly for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024. During the second quarter of 2024, members of OPEC and certain other countries, including Russia (informally known as OPEC+ ), agreed to extend additional crude oil production cuts of 2.2 MMBBL/D until the end of September 2024 and prolonged other production cuts until the end of 2025. In early September 2024, OPEC+ announced the delay of the October 2024 output increase for two months. Saudi Arabia has indicated that it will bring back production as planned in December 2024, regardless of market conditions or oil prices at that time, as a strategic decision to increase its market share , which could reduce oil commodity prices. Since 2022, OPEC + has implemented various production cuts to address the uncertain outlook in the global economic and oil markets. 
 
 Natural gas pricing continues to be volatile and has increased for the third quarter of 2024 to an average of 2.11 per MMBtu compared to an average of 2.07 per MMBtu for the second quarter of 2024. Realized natural gas prices for U.S. producers in West Texas and for Canadian E P customers are typically at a discount to U.S. Henry Hub pricing. The natural gas price declines in 2024 are due to a mild winter earlier in the year and the continued high surplus levels of natural gas in storage, negatively impacting drilling and completion activity in certain regions, particularly in the United States. 
 
 Sustained significant declines in commodity prices, or sustained periods when the local pricing received in regional markets is below benchmark pricing, known in the industry as high differentials, would be expected to lead North American E P companies to reduce drilling and completion activity, which could negatively impact our business.

Listed and depicted below are the average number of operating onshore rigs in the United States and in Canada per quarter since the third quarter of 2023, as provided by Baker Hughes Company. The quarterly changes, particularly for the second quarter Canadian land rig count, are partially attributable to seasonality of activity in that market:

Over the past several years, North American E P companies have been able to reduce their cost structures and have also utilized technologies, including ours, to increase efficiency and improve well performance. The average U.S. land rig count and completion activity has decreased from the highs reached during the fourth quarter of 2022. In the third quarter of 2024, the average U.S. land rig count was 566, a decline of 10 and 3 , respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024. The average land rig count in Canada for the third quarter of 2024 was higher by 11 compared to the same period in 2023. We currently expect U.S. rig counts and completion activity for the remainder of 2024 to be lower than the comparable data for 2023, but we expect the Canadian activity level for the remainder of the year to be slightly higher than the activity level for the prior year.

A substantial portion of our business is subject to seasonality, which results in quarterly variability. In Canada, we typically experience higher activity levels in the first quarter of each year, as our customers take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. In the past, our revenue in Canada has declined during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions that result in thawing, softer ground, difficulty accessing well sites and road bans that curtail drilling and completion activity. Access to well sites typically improves throughout the third and fourth quarters in Canada, leading to activity levels that are higher than in the second quarter, but usually lower than activity in the first quarter. Canadian completions activity can be impacted by wildfires that are usually experienced in the spring and summer seasons, but weather and wildfire conditions this year were favorable compared to 2023. Our business can be impacted by a reduction in customer activity during the winter holidays in late December and early January. In some years, customers in the United States and Canada may exhaust their capital budgets before year-end, resulting in lower drilling and completion activity during the fourth quarter. We expect this to be the case this year in the United States, and to a lesser extent in Canada. 
 
 How We Generate Revenues 
 
 We derive our revenues from the sale of our fracturing systems and enhanced recovery systems products and the provision of related services, casing buoyancy systems, liner hanger systems and toe initiation sleeves products and from sales of our tracer diagnostics services in addition to the sale of composite frac plugs, perforating guns and related products through Repeat Precision. 
 
 Product sales represented 72 and 71 of our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 70 and 71 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Most of our sales are on a just-in-time basis, as specified in individual purchase orders, with a fixed price for our products. We occasionally supply our customers with large orders that may be filled on negotiated terms. Services represented 28 and 29 of our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 30 and 29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Services include tool charges and associated personnel costs related to fracturing systems and tracer diagnostics services. Our services are provided at agreed-upon rates to customers for the provision of our downhole frac isolation assembly, which may include our personnel, and for the provision of tracer diagnostics services. 
 
 During periods of low drilling and well completion activity, or as may be needed to compete in certain markets, we may, in some instances, lower the prices of our products and services. Our revenues are also impacted by well complexity since wells with more stages typically result in longer jobs, which may increase revenue attributable to the use of more sliding sleeves or increase composite frac plug sales, and increase the volume of services we provide. 
 
 The percentages of our revenues derived from sales in Canada and denominated in Canadian dollars were approximately 66 and 74 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 62 and 68 for the nine months then ended. Our Canadian contracts are typically invoiced in Canadian dollars; therefore, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations impact our revenues and are regularly monitored. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency, relative to the Canadian dollar would result in lower reported revenues, partially offset by lower reported cost of sales and SG A expenses.

Table of Contents 

Although most of our sales are to North American E P companies, we also have sales to customers outside of North America, and we expect sales to international customers to increase over time. These international sales are made through local NCS entities or to our local operating partners typically on a free on board or free carrier basis with a point of sale in the United States. Some of the locations in which we have operating partners or sales representatives include the Middle East and China. Our operating partners and representatives do not have authority to contractually bind NCS but market our products in their respective territories as part of their product or services offering. 
 
 Costs of Conducting our Business 
 
 Our cost of sales is comprised of expenses relating to the manufacture of our products in addition to the costs of our support services. Manufacturing cost of sales includes payments made to our suppliers for raw materials and payments made to machine shops for the manufacture of product components and finished assemblies and costs related to our employees that perform quality control analysis, assemble and test our products. In addition, Repeat Precision operates a manufacturing facility with supporting personnel in Mexico, which has allowed us to reduce our costs for certain product categories. We review forecasted activity levels in our business and either directly procure or support our vendors in procuring the required raw materials with sufficient lead time to meet our business requirements. We obtain certain chemicals utilized in our tracer diagnostics services business from suppliers in China, which are subject to tariffs that increase our costs. While these tariffs have recently declined, there is a possibility that they could be increased substantially following the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Prices for certain raw materials, including steel and chemicals and for purchased components and outsourced services, have increased in recent years due to inflation, exacerbated by the impacts resulting from Russia s continuing invasion of Ukraine, although steel pricing has since declined from their recent highs. Cost of sales for support services includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for employees who provide direct revenue generating services to customers in addition to the costs incurred by these employees for travel and subsistence while on site. Cost of sales includes other variable manufacturing costs, such as shrinkage, obsolescence, revaluation and scrap related to our existing inventory and costs related to the chemicals used and laboratory analysis associated with our tracer diagnostics services. 
 
 Our SG A expenses are comprised of compensation expense, which includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for our employees who are not directly involved in revenue generating activities, including those involved in our research and development activities, as well as our general operating costs. These general operating costs include but are not limited to: rent and occupancy for our facilities, information technology infrastructure services, software licensing, advertising and marketing, third party research and development, risk insurance and professional service fees for audit, legal and other consulting services. Our SG A expenses also include litigation expenses, severance expenses and expected credit losses. 
 
 In an effort to streamline operations and gain efficiencies, in 2023 we implemented several cost reduction initiatives, including consolidation of our tracer diagnostics operations, consolidation of Repeat s manufacturing footprint in Mexico, restructuring of certain U.S. and international operations, and the elimination of various support positions. As a result of these efforts, we expect to realize annualized cost savings of approximately 4.0 million in 2024. See Note 8. Accrued Expenses to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
 
 The percentage of our operating costs denominated in Canadian dollars (including cost of sales and SG A expenses but excluding depreciation and amortization expense) approximated 30 and 31 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 28 and 30 for the nine months then ended.

Revenues 
 
 Revenues were 44.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 38.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Revenue growth was driven by i ncreases in international services, U.S. product sales, and Canada product sales and services. These gains were partially offset by lower U.S. services revenues and international product sales. The significant increase in international revenues was driven b y Mid dle East tracer work and North Sea frac systems , while the increase in the United States reflects higher frac plug and perforating gun sales by our joint venture, Repeat Precision. Despite the increase in U.S. revenues, customer activity continues to be negatively impacted by lower natural gas prices. The increase in our Canadian revenue was due in part to higher fracturing systems activity in 2024, as the prior year was impacted more significantly by Canadian wildfires stemming from drought conditions. Ov e rall, product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 31.7 million compared to 27.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Services revenues totaled 12.3 million compared to 11.0 million for the same periods. 
 
 Cost of sales 
 
 Cost of sales was 26.2 m illion, or 59.5 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23.1 million, or 60.4 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in the cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to an increase in higher-margin international work in both the Middle East and North Sea , an increase in frac plug and perforating gun sales in the United States, as well as the benefits realized from operational restructuring efforts enacted in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , cost of product sales was 19.9 million, or 62.8 of product sales revenue, and cost of services was 6.3 million, or 50.9 of services revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 , cost of product sales was 17.5 million, or 64.3 of product sales revenue, and cost of services was 5.6 million, or 50.9 of services revenue.

Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in expense reflects a higher annual incentive bonus accrual of 2.2 million year-over-year partially offset by the benefit of cost-saving measures implemented through our restructuring efforts during 2023. 
 
 Depreciation 
 
 Depreciation totaled 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to assets placed in service during the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024, primarily light vehicles and trucks under finance leases through our leasing program with a fleet management company. 
 
 Provision for litigation, net of recoveries 
 
 Provision for litigation totaled 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, related to the settlement of the Wyoming Matter, whereby the plaintiff received 2.0 million, which was paid on our behalf under a policy of insurance, and we received 0.6 million for unpaid invoices, recorded as other income, net in the accompanying statement of operations. We also reversed our accrual for legal contingencies for this matter which totaled 1.7 million. Offsetting this benefit, in October 2023 the Canada Court ordered us to pay 1.8 million 2.5 million in Canadian dollars) of legal fees associated with a patent infringement case, which we accrued during the three months ended September 30, 2023. These matters have been previously described in our Annual Report. See Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
 
 Other income, net 
 
 Other income, net was 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other income was primarily attributable to the recovery of unpaid invoices through settlement of the Wyoming Matter in 2023, as discussed above, as well as the reversal of a legal contingency fee, partially offset in 2024 by increases in royalty income from licensees, and an increase in the benefit provided from our technical services and assistance agreement with our local partner in Oman. 
 
 Foreign currency exchange gain (loss), net 
 
 Foreign currency exchange gain (loss), net was 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (0.2) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was due to the movement in the foreign currency exchange rates between the periods, primarily the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. 
 
 Income tax benefit 
 
 Income tax benefit was less than 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate ETR from continuing operations was (0.7 and (15.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax benefit for these periods primarily relates to results generated by our United States, Canada, and certain other foreign businesses, and the income tax provision for each three-month period excludes the effects of losses within the United States, Canada, or other jurisdictions, from which we cannot currently benefit. In addition, the income tax provision includes the effects of changes in valuation allowances established against our previously recognized deferred tax assets, some of which are derived from net operating loss carryforwards in the United States, Canada, or other jurisdictions. Therefore, significant variations exist in the customary relationship between income tax expense and pretax accounting income for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Revenues 
 
 Revenues were 117.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 107.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue growth was driven by increases in international product sales and services revenues, U.S. product sales, and Canada services revenues. The gains were partially offset by lower U.S. services revenues and Canada product sales. The significant increase in international revenues was driven by North Sea frac systems and Middle East tracer work, while the increase in the United States was driven by an increase in frac plug and perforating gun sales by our joint venture, Repeat Precision, despite a reduction in industry rig count. Our Canadian results were comparable year-over-year, with a small decline in product sales partially offset by a small increase in service sales, reflecting the timing and mix of certain planned frac systems work and E P consolidation transactions. Ove rall, product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 82.5 million compared to 76.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Services revenues totaled 35.1 million and 31.1 million for the same periods. 
 
 Cost of sales 
 
 Cost of sales was 71.4 m illion, or 60.8 of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 66.1 million, or 61.7 of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in the cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to an increase in higher-margin international work in the Middle East and the North Sea and the benefits realized from operational restructurings enacted in 2023. Fo r the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , cost of product sales was 52.7 million, or 63.9 of product sales revenue, and cost of services was 18.7 million, or 53.4 of services revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , cost of product sales was 49.1 million, or 64.5 of product sales revenue, and cost of services was 17.0 million, or 54.7 of services revenue.

Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 42.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 43.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in expense reflects the realization of cost-savings associated with restructuring efforts during 2023, as well as lower share-based compensation, insurance, and professional fees of 0.8 million, 0.5 million, and 0.4 million, respectively. The decrease in expense was partially offset by a 2.7 million increase in relative annual incentive bonus accruals year-over-year. 
 
 Depreciation 
 
 Depreciation totaled 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to assets placed in service during the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024, primarily light vehicles and trucks under finance leases through our leasing program with a fleet management company. 
 
 Provision for litigation, net of recoveries 
 
 Provision for litigation totaled 42.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to the Texas Matter for which we accrued a judgment that was later settled by all parties during the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting in no cash payments by NCS and a reversal of this accrual. The settlement was fully paid by the insurance carrier in January 2024. This balance also reflects the reversal of an accrual of 1.7 million associated with the Wyoming Matter, which was settled by insurance during the third quarter of 2023, offset by an incremental accrual associated with a Canadian patent matter, whereby, in October 2023 the Canada Court ordered us to pay 1.8 million 2.5 million in Canadian dollars) of legal fees associated with a patent infringement case. These matters have been previously described in our Annual Report. See Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
 
 Other income, net 
 
 Other income, net was 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other income was primarily attributable to royalty income from licensees and an increase in the benefit associated with our technical services and assistance agreement with our local partner in Oman. The increase in other income was partially offset by a 0.6 million benefit from the recovery of unpaid invoices associated with the Wyoming Matter in 2023, which did not recur in 2024. 
 
 Foreign currency exchange loss, net 
 
 Foreign currency exchange loss, net was 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was due to the movement in the foreign currency exchange rates between the periods, primarily the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. 
 
 Income tax expense (benefit) 
 
 Income tax expense was 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a tax benefit of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate ETR from continuing operations was 14.0 and 0.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax expense for these periods primarily relates to results generated by our United States, Canada, and certain other foreign businesses, and the income tax provision for each period excludes the effects of losses within the United States, Canada, or other jurisdictions from which we cannot currently benefit. In addition, for each of the nine-month periods, the income tax provision includes the effects of changes in valuation allowances established against our previously recognized deferred tax assets, including against net operating loss carryforwards, in the United States, Canada, or other jurisdictions. Therefore, significant variations exist in the customary relationship between income tax expense and pretax accounting income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and potential borrowings under our secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Facility and the Repeat Precision Promissory Note (as defined below). As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 15.3 million, and total outstanding indebtedness of 8.6 million related to finance lease obligations. Our ABL Facility consists of an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 35.0 million. Total borrowings are limited to a borrowing base calculated on the sum of cash in a specified pledged account, eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory, provided it does not include credit for the assets of Repeat Precision. At September 30, 2024, our available borrowing base under the ABL Facility was 21.7 million, with no outstanding borrowings. The amount available to be drawn under the ABL Facility may decline from current levels due to reductions in our borrowing base or a springing financial covenant if our business were to be adversely impacted by a decline in market conditions. We were in compliance with our debt covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 
 In addition, Repeat Precision s promissory note with Security State Bank Trust, Fredericksburg (the Repeat Precision Promissory Note has total aggregate borrowing capacity of 2.5 million, lowered from an aggregate borrowing capacity of 4.3 million upon renewal in May 2024, as discussed at "Note 9. Debt, Repeat Precision Promissory Note" in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, Repeat Precision has no outstanding indebtedness under the promissory note. 

26

Table of Contents 

We believe that our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and potential borrowings under our ABL Facility and the Repeat Precision Promissory Note will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditure and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months and after. Our principal liquidity needs have been, and are expected to continue to be, capital expenditures, working capital, debt service and potential mergers and acquisitions. 
 
 Our capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.2 million and 2.0 million, respectively. We plan to incur approximately 1.5 million to 1.7 million in capital expenditures during 2024, which includes (i) new computing equipment, (ii) upgrades to our tracer diagnostics deployment, sampling and laboratory equipment and (iii) upgrades to our manufacturing and field service equipment to support North American fracturing systems and well construction businesses. 
 
 To the extent we require additional liquidity to fund our capital requirements, including our finance lease obligations, or repay existing indebtedness, we would expect to obtain it through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the proceeds of equity issuances, or a combination thereof. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. Our liquidity and ability to meet our obligations and fund capital requirements also depend on our future financial performance including the ability to manage costs, which is subject to general economic, financial and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that funds will be available from additional indebtedness, the capital markets or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. If we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell equity to finance such acquisitions, which could result in incremental expenses or dilution.

Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 2.1 million compared to a use of (1.4) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our net income was significantly higher in 2024 compared to 2023. During the first nine months of 2023, we recorded a net loss associated with a 42.5 million provision for litigation, which subsequently settled and for which the provision was reversed during the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of this provision from the 2023 results, our year-over-year net income would have been higher in 2024 than in 2023 by 4.9 million. This improved performance reflects an increase in revenue for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in sales impacts our inventory levels, the timing of trade receivable billings and collections, and payments for materials and other components. These results for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the relative period in 2023 reflects a lower inventory build (favorable cash impact of 5.1 million), an increase in trade receivables of 10.2 million (a use of cash) due in part to a relative increase in international activity, which can take longer to collect, a decrease in payables of 1.8 million (use of cash) and an increase in accrued expenses of 4.2 million (a source of cash), partially attributable to higher incentive accruals that correspond to improved operating performance.

Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 0.7 million and 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting a lower level of investment in property and equipment and software and technology. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 2.7 million and 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our primary uses of funds for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were principal payments of 1.4 million and 1.2 million, respectively, payments of 0.2 million and 0.3 million, respectively, for treasury shares withheld to settle withholding tax requirements for equity-settled share-based compensation, and a distribution of 1.0 million to Repeat Precision's other joint venture partner for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net borrowings and repayments under the Repeat Promissory Note had no relative impact on cash flows from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 
 Except for the operating leases as discussed in "Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies" to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no significant changes in our material cash requirements from those disclosed in the Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023.
