CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of statements that include words such as could, may, might, will, expect, likely, believe, continue, anticipate, estimate, intend, plan, project and other similar words or phrases. Forward-looking statements involve estimates and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. 
 The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on assumptions that we have made considering our industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other important factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control) and assumptions. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many important factors could affect our actual operating and financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance anticipated in the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the following: changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, political uncertainty (including as a result of the upcoming 2024 elections), demand for our products, inflation, changes in consumer preferences, competition within our industry, our ability to maintain a reliable network of dealers, elevated inventories resulting in increased costs for dealers, our ability to manage our manufacturing levels and our fixed cost base, the successful introduction of our new products, including our new Balise brand, the success of our strategic divestments, geopolitical conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict in the Gaza Strip and general unrest in the Middle East, financial institution disruptions and the other important factors described under the caption Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on August 30, 2024 (our 2024 Annual Report ). Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove incorrect, our actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements. 
 Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New important factors that could cause our business not to develop as we expect may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.

In fiscal 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the Credit Agreement that provided the Company with a million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a million term loan (the Term Loan and a million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ). The Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company's assets. Following the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement Fourth Amendment ), as described below, all amounts under the Term Loan were repaid and the amended and restated Credit Agreement only provides the Company with the Revolving Credit Facility. The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company s ability to, subject to specified exceptions, incur additional debt; incur additional liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; pay dividends or make other distributions; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. The Company is also required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio. As previously disclosed, the Credit Agreement was amended in August 2022 and October 2023, in each case to, among other things, provide consents and waivers to certain restrictions in the covenants of the Credit Agreement. On September 27, 2024, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to obtain the necessary consents and waivers to the restrictions described above in the covenants of the Credit Agreement, as related to the Aviara Transaction and plans to sell certain facility assets, as discussed in Note 3. In addition, the Fourth Amendment provides a waiver to the fixed charge covenant ratio for certain periods. As a result of the fixed charge covenant ratio waiver, the applicable margin on interest and the commitment fee for any unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility for these periods is fixed at the maximum allowable rate Fourth Amendment Interest Terms ). Further, the Company may make restricted payments, including share repurchases under the Company's share repurchase program (see Note 12), in an aggregate amount not to exceed million through March 31, 2025. The Credit Agreement, as amended, bears interest, at the Company s option, at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to or at an adjusted term benchmark rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to , in each case based on the Company s net leverage ratio, subject to the Fourth Amendment Interest Terms. The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee for any unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility ranging from to based on the Company s net leverage ratio, subject to the Fourth Amendment Interest Terms. Effective prior to the Company's entry into the Fourth Amendment, during substantially all of the three months ended September 29, 2024 , the applicable margin for loans accruing at the prime rate was and the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at the benchmark rate was . As of September 29, 2024 , in compliance with the Fourth Amendment Interest Terms, the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at the prime rate was and the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at the benchmark rate was , and the Company s all-in interest rate on amounts drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility was .

million on its Revolving Credit Facility. Drawn amounts were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had remaining availability of million on the Revolving Credit Facility. 

 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 primarily relate to the inclusion of the benefit of federal and state credits and changes in uncertain tax positions, partially offset by the state tax rate in the overall effective rate. During the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the Company's effective tax rate was and , respectively. The Company s effective tax rates for the three months ended September 29, 2024 are lower compared to the effective tax rate for the same prior-year period, primarily due to changes in uncertain tax positions and an increased benefit of federal and state credits. 

Performance stock units 

Share-based compensation expense 

Restricted Stock Awards During the three months ended September 29, 2024 , the Company granted restricted stock awards RSAs to the Company s non-executive directors, officers and certain other key employees. Generally, the shares of restricted stock granted during the three months ended September 29, 2024 , vest pro-rata over two or for officers and certain other key employees and over for non-executive directors. The Company determined the fair value of the shares awarded by using the close price of our common stock as of the date of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value of RSAs granted in the three months ended September 29, 2024 , was per share.

performance period. The performance period for the awards commences on July 1 of the fiscal year in which they were granted and continue for a three-year period, ending on June 30 of the applicable year. The probability of achieving the performance criteria is assessed quarterly. Following the determination of the Company s achievement with respect to the performance criteria, the number of shares awarded is subject to further adjustment based on the application of a total shareholder return TSR modifier. The grant date fair value is determined based on both the probability assessment of the Company achieving the performance criteria and an estimate of the expected TSR modifier. The TSR modifier estimate is determined using a Monte Carlo Simulation model, which considers the likelihood of numerous possible outcomes of long-term market performance. Compensation expense related to existing nonvested PSUs is recognized ratably over the performance period. PSUs awarded in fiscal 2025 have performance criteria set annually over the three-year performance period. This performance criteria is cumulative and is based upon the respective year s performance compared to budget, which has not yet been established for future performance periods. Therefore, the compensation expense for these awards will not begin until all the key terms and conditions of these awards are known, which will be year three of the performance period. 

Forfeited 

() 

Nonvested at September 29, 2024 

As of September 29, 2024, there was no unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested PSUs. Incentive Award Plan On October 22, 2024, at the Company's annual meeting of shareholders, the Company's shareholders approved the Second Amended and Restated MasterCraft 2015 Incentive Award Plan (the Restated Incentive Plan ), as described in the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement, filed with the SEC on September 23, 2024, to replace the Amended and Restated MCBC Holdings, Inc. 2015 Incentive Award Plan effective as of the date of shareholder approval. The Restated Incentive Plan authorizes an aggregate issuance of up to shares of common stock, subject to adjustment, in the form of awards of performance awards, restricted shares, restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other share-based awards. The Company's employees, consultants, and non-employee directors, and employees, consultants, and non-employee directors of our affiliates are eligible to receive awards under the Restated Incentive Plan.

A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant s historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and statistical measures. The Company includes non-GAAP financial measures in Management s Discussion and Analysis, as the Company s management believes that these measures and the information they provide are useful to users of the financial statements, including investors, because they permit users of the financial statements to view the Company s performance using the same tools that management utilizes and to better evaluate the Company s ongoing business performance. In order to better align the Company s reported results with the internal metrics used by the Company's management to evaluate business performance as well as to provide better comparisons to prior periods and peer data, non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of purchase accounting amortization related to business acquisitions. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 The Company's results for all periods presented, as discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis, are presented on a continuing operations basis. Results related to our Aviara and NauticStar reporting units are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 3 in Notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on discontinued operations. 
 On August 8, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into the Aviara Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which it will transfer rights to the Aviara brand of luxury dayboats and certain related assets to a subsidiary of MarineMax. Subsequent to our fiscal first quarter, the transaction was completed and remains subject to customary closing conditions. As discussed in Note 1, the Company has reported the results of operations for its Aviara segment as discontinued operations in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 Additionally, on September 12, 2024, we announced that we had entered into the Aviara Facility Sale Agreement. The transaction is expected to be completed in our fiscal second quarter and remains subject to customary closing conditions. As discussed in Note 1, the related assets and liabilities are classified as held-for-sale in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Overview 
 Amid market volatility and challenging macroeconomic conditions, retail demand remained soft throughout the key selling season. In response, the Company implemented a wholesale strategy for the start of the fiscal 2025 that prioritized rebalancing of dealer inventory levels. This approach, while necessary, led to decreased net sales and reduced gross margins due to fixed cost absorption on the lower production levels.

Net sales decreased 28.9 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 when compared with the same prior-year period. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by lower unit volumes and unfavorable model mix. 
 Gross margin percentage declined 570 basis points during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 when compared with the same prior-year period. Lower margins were the result of lower cost absorption due to decreased production volume and higher dealer incentives as a percentage of net sales. Dealer incentives include measures taken by the Company to assist dealers as the retail environment remains competitive. 
 Operating expenses decreased 1.1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 when compared to the same prior-year period. The decrease in operating expenses was a result of lower share-based compensation costs and lower professional fees.

 Non-GAAP Measures 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA margin, and Adjusted EBITDA margin 
 We define EBITDA as income from continuing operations, before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations. For the periods presented herein, the adjustments are for share-based compensation, and CEO transition and organizational realignment costs. We define EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, each expressed as a percentage of Net sales. 
 20 

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share 
 We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share as income from continuing operations, adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and reflecting income tax expense on adjusted net income before income taxes at our estimated annual effective tax rate. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include other intangible asset amortization, share-based compensation, and CEO transition and organizational realignment costs. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per share, which we refer to collectively as the Non-GAAP Measures, are not measures of net income or operating income as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The Non-GAAP Measures are not measures of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income per share, or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow. We believe that the inclusion of the Non-GAAP Measures is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts and investors use the Non-GAAP Measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than does U.S. GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share assists our Board, management, investors, and other users of the financial statements in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes certain non-cash items and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and reflecting income tax expense on adjusted net income before income taxes at our estimated annual effective tax rate. The Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and the Non-GAAP measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 

The Non-GAAP measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

The Non-GAAP measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Certain Non-GAAP measures do not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes; 

Certain Non-GAAP measures do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and 

The Non-GAAP measures do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations. 

In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance working capital, fund capital expenditures, service our debt, fund potential acquisitions, and fund our share repurchase program. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash balance, held-to-maturity securities, cash generated from operating activities, our revolving credit agreement and the refinancing and/or new issuance of long-term debt. We believe our cash balance, held-to-maturity securities, cash from operations, and our ability to borrow will be sufficient to provide for our liquidity and capital resource needs. 
 Cash and cash equivalents totaled 14.2 million as of September 29, 2024, an increase of 6.8 million from 7.4 million as of June 30, 2024. Held-to-maturity securities totaled 68.6 million as of September 29, 2024, a decrease of 10.3 million from 78.9 million as of June 30, 2024. Total debt as of September 29, 2024 and June 30, 2024, was 49.5 million and 49.3 million, respectively. 
 As of September 29, 2024, we had 49.5 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving 50.5 million of available borrowing capacity. Refer to Note 9 Long Term Debt in the Notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 On July 24, 2023, the Board of the Company authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 50 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. The authorization became effective upon the completion of the Company's previously existing 50 million stock repurchase authorization. 
 During the three months ended September 29, 2024, the Company repurchased 183,629 shares of common stock for 3.5 million in cash, excluding related fees and expenses under both plans.

Three Months Ended September 29, 2024 Cash Flows from Continuing Operations 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 29, 2024 was 0.5 million, primarily due to working capital usage, partially offset by net income. Working capital is defined as accounts receivable, income tax receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other current assets net of accounts payable, income tax payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities as presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Working capital usage primarily consisted of a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and an increase in accounts receivable. Partially offsetting the working capital usage was an increase in accounts payables and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities decreased due to payment of dealer incentives and variable compensation. Accounts receivable increased due to timing of sales and collections at the end of the period compared to the end of the prior-year period. Accounts payables increased due to increased production compared to the prior-year period. Prepaid and other current assets decreased due to amortization of insurance premiums. 
 23 

Net cash provided by investing activities was 8.4 million, which included 10.6 million of proceeds in held-to-maturity securities, partially offset by 2.2 million in capital expenditures. Our capital spending was primarily focused on information technology, machinery and equipment, and tooling. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 4.0 million, which included share repurchases totaling 3.5 million and 49.5 million used to repay outstanding borrowings of the Term Loan which was offset by 49.5 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Three Months Ended October 1, 2023 Cash Flows from Continuing Operations 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended October 1, 2023 was 4.8 million, primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital, partially offset by net income. Working capital usage primarily consisted of decreases in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, income tax payable, and accounts payable, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Partially offsetting the working capital usage was a decrease in inventories. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities decreased due to payment of dealer incentives and variable compensation. Income tax payable decreased due to tax payments within the quarter. Accounts payable decreased due to lower production at the end of the period compared to the end of the prior year period. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased due to an increase in prepaid expenses, partially offset by amortization of insurance premiums. Inventories decreased as we adjust inventory levels to align with lower production levels. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 22.5 million, due to net changes in held-to-maturity securities of 25.6 million, partially offset by 3.1 million of capital expenditures. Our capital spending was mainly focused on tooling, facility enhancements, and information technology. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 8.4 million, which included net payments of 1.1 million on long-term debt and 5.8 million of stock repurchases.
