 Contract Assets Liabilities 
 
 Contract assets are established when revenues are recognized prior to a contractual payment due from the customer. When a payment becomes due based on the contract terms, the Company will reduce the contract asset and record a receivable. Contract liabilities are deferred revenues that are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance obligations. Our payment terms vary by the type and location of the products offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant.

 and for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21 due to foreign income taxed at different tax rates and changes in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21 due to foreign income taxed at different tax rates and changes in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes imposed by the U.S., various states, and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Each jurisdiction establishes rules that set forth the years which are subject to examination by its tax authorities. While the Company believes the tax positions taken on its tax returns for each jurisdiction are supportable, they may still be challenged by the jurisdiction's tax authorities. In anticipation of such challenges, the Company has established reserves for tax-related uncertainties. These liabilities are based on the Company s best estimate of the potential tax exposures in each respective jurisdiction. It may take a number of years for a final tax liability in a jurisdiction to be determined, particularly in the event of an audit. If an uncertain matter is determined favorably, there could be a reduction in the Company s tax expense. An unfavorable determination could increase tax expense and could require a cash payment, including interest and penalties.

million, with a sublimit of million which can be used for letters of credit for the account of the Company or its subsidiaries that are parties to the Credit Agreement. The proceeds of the 2020 Revolving Facility may be used on an ongoing basis for working capital and general corporate purposes. The aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Revolving Facility may be increased by a maximum of 
 million upon the request of the Company, subject to the terms of the 2020 Credit Agreement. The 2020 Credit Agreement terminates on March 20, 2025. Because the Credit Agreement expires less than one year from the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2024, the outstanding balance of long-term debt has been reclassified as a current liability. 
 On May 5, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement Amendment amending the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated March 20, 2020. The primary purpose of the changes made in the Credit Agreement Amendment was to update the interest rate provisions to replace LIBOR with SOFR for U.S. dollar denominated loans as well as update the other applicable reference borrowing rates for foreign currency loans which took effect on June 15, 2023. Interest payable on amounts borrowed under the 2020 Revolving Facility, taking into account the effect of the Credit Agreement Amendment, is based upon the following: (a) for revolving credit loans denominated in US Dollars, the SOFR rate plus applicable credit spread; and (b) for revolving credit loans denominated in foreign currencies, at other applicable local reference rates plus an interest margin. Depending upon the Company s leverage ratio, an interest rate margin ranging from to per annum is added to the applicable SOFR rate to determine the interest payable on the SOFR loans. The Company is required to pay a quarterly fee of per annum to per annum on the unused portion of the 2020 Revolving Facility, which is determined based on the Company s leverage ratio each quarter. Additional customary fees apply with respect to letters of credit. 
 On August 15, 2024, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2024 Credit Agreement among the Company, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and HSBC as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunner, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, as agent for such lenders, pursuant to which the 2020 Credit Agreement, was amended and restated to, among other things, extend the maturity date from March 20, 2025 to August 15, 2029 and adjust the interest rate and commitment fee. The 2024 Credit Agreement provides for a multi-currency, secured credit facility (the 2024 Revolving Facility in an aggregate principal amount of million, with a sublimit of million which can be used for letters of credit for the account of the Company or its subsidiaries that are parties to the 2024 Credit Agreement, the proceeds of which may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, and a portion of which were used to refinance the 2020 Revolving Facility. The Company may elect to make loans under the 2024 Revolving Facility in US Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Sterling, Japanese Yen or such other freely convertible foreign currency. 
 
 Amounts borrowed under the 2024 Revolving Facility accrue interest in an amount equal to a floating rate plus a specified margin. Such floating rates are (i) for loans denominated in US Dollars, at the Company s option, either (a) the greatest of: the Agent s prime rate, the Federal Funds rate, or a floor (the US Base Rate ), or (b) the SOFR, (ii) for loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, at the Company s option, either (x) the greatest of: the PRIMCAN Index rate, the average day rate for loans accruing interest based on the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average CORRA (the Canadian Base Rate ), or (y) CORRA, (iii) for loans denominated in Pounds Sterling, the Sterling Overnight Index Average SONIA ), (iv) for loans denominated in Euros, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR"), and (v) for loans denominated in Japanese Yen, the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate TIBOR ). The specified interest margin for US Base Rate Loans and Canadian Base Rate Loans is . Depending upon the Company s leverage ratio, the interest rate margin for loans based on SOFR, CORRA, SONIA, EURIBOR and TIBOR ranges from to per annum. The Company is required to pay a quarterly fee of per annum to per annum on the unused portion of the 2024 Revolving Facility, which is also determined based on the Company s leverage ratio. Additional customary fees apply with respect to letters of credit.

 shares of common stock. At September 28, 2024, the Company had reserved shares of common stock for future grants of equity awards (restricted stock, unrestricted stock, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), or stock options) pursuant to the 2022 plan. If any outstanding awards are forfeited by the holder or canceled by the Company, the underlying shares would be available for re-grant to others. If shares are withheld for payment of taxes, those shares do not become available for grant under the 2022 plan. 
 On March 7, 2024 and in accordance with their respective employment agreements, VPG s executive officers were granted annual equity awards in the form of RSUs, of which are performance-based. The awards have an aggregate target grant-date fair value of million and were comprised of RSUs. percent of these awards will vest on January 1, 2027, subject to the executives continued employment. The performance-based portion of the RSUs will also vest on January 1, 2027, subject to the executives' continued employment and the satisfaction of certain performance objectives relating to cumulative adjusted free cash flow and "net earnings goals", each weighted equally. 
 On March 7, 2024, certain non-executive VPG employees were granted annual equity awards in the form of RSUs. Certain employees received awards, of which are performance-based and certain employees received awards of which are performance-based. The awards have an aggregate grant-date fair value of million and were comprised of RSUs. The non-performance portion of these awards percent for certain employees and percent for certain employees) will vest on January 1, 2027, subject to the employees' continued employment. The performance-based portion of the RSUs will also vest on January 1, 2027, subject to the employees' continued employment and the satisfaction of certain performance objectives relating to cumulative earnings and cash flow goals, each weighted equally. 
 On May 22, 2024, and in accordance with the Company's 2024 Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of an aggregate of RSUs to the independent board members of the Board of Directors. The awards have an aggregate grant-date fair value of million and will vest on or before the 2025 Annual Stockholders Meeting in May 2025, subject to each applicable director's continued service on the Board of Directors. Vesting of equity awards is subject to acceleration under certain circumstances.

Note 9 - Share-Based Compensation (continued) 

 RSUs to an independent board member of the Board of Directors in connection with his appointment to the Board of Directors. The award had an aggregate grant-date fair value of million and will vest on or before the 2025 Annual Stockholders Meeting in May 2025, subject to such independent director's continued service on the Board of Directors. Vesting of such equity awards is subject to acceleration under certain circumstances. 
 The amount of compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued. VPG determines compensation cost for RSUs based on the grant-date fair value of the underlying common stock. The Company recognizes compensation cost for RSUs that are expected to vest and for which performance criteria are expected to be met. 
 
 million decreasing share-based compensation expense was recorded based on the evaluation of performance objectives associated with awards granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024. It was determined that certain objectives were not likely to be fully met, necessitating a reversal of certain compensation expenses associated with those awards.

 reporting segments: Sensors, Weighing Solutions, and Measurement Systems. The Sensors segment is comprised of the foil resistor and strain gage operating segments. The Weighing Solutions segment is comprised of specialized modules and systems used to precisely measure weight, force torque, and pressure. The Measurement Systems segment is comprised of highly specialized systems for steel production, materials development, and safety testing. 
 The chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is our chief executive officer. The CODM evaluates each operating segment's performance. The evaluation of the segment's performance is based on multiple performance measures including gross profits, revenues, and operating income, exclusive of certain items. Management believes that evaluating segment performance, excluding items such as restructuring and severance costs, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, acquisition costs, and other items is meaningful because they relate to occurrences or events that are outside of our core operations, and management believes that the use of these measures provides a consistent basis to evaluate our operating profitability and performance trends across comparable periods.

Note 13 Fair Value Measurements (continued) 

 December 31, 2023 Assets Assets held in rabbi trusts 
 The Company maintains non-qualified trusts, referred to as rabbi trusts, to fund payments under deferred compensation and non-qualified pension plans. Rabbi trust assets consist primarily of marketable securities, classified as available-for-sale money market funds at September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and company-owned life insurance assets. The marketable securities held in the rabbi trusts are valued using quoted market prices on the last business day of the period. The company-owned life insurance assets are valued in consultation with the Company s insurance brokers using the value of underlying assets of the insurance contracts. The fair value measurement of the cash equivalents held in the rabbi trust are considered a Level 1 measurement and the measurement of the company-owned life insurance assets is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. 
 The fair value of the long-term debt, excluding capitalized deferred financing costs, at September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximates its carrying value as the revolving debt is reset on a monthly basis based on current market rates, plus a base rate as specified in the debt agreement. The fair value of long-term debt is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Overview 
 VPG is a global leader in precision measurement and sensing technologies that help power the future by bridging the physical world with the digital one. Many of our specialized sensors, weighing solutions, and measurement systems are designed-in by our customers, and address growing applications across a diverse array of industries and markets. Our products are marketed under brand names that we believe are characterized as having a very high level of precision and quality, and we employ an operationally diversified structure to manage our businesses. 
 Driven by the continued proliferation of data generated by the expanding use of sensors across a widening array of industrial and non-industrial applications, precision measurement and sensing technologies help ensure and deliver required levels of quality of mission-critical or high-value data. VPG s products are often at the first stage of a data value chain (i.e., the process of converting the physical world into a digital format that can be used for a specific purpose) and as such impact the effectiveness of vast number of critical, high-value downstream processes. Over the past few years, we have seen a broadening of precision sensing applications in both our traditional industrial markets and new markets, due to the development of higher functionality in our customers' end products. Our precision measurement solutions are used across a wide variety of end markets upon which we focus, including industrial, test and measurement, transportation, steel, medical, agriculture, avionics, military and space, and consumer product applications. The Company has a long heritage of innovation in sensor technologies that provide accuracy, reliability and repeatability that make our customers' products safer, smarter, and more productive. As the functionality of customers' products continues to increase, and they integrate more precision measurement sensors and related systems into their solutions, we believe this will offer substantial growth opportunities for our products and expertise. 
 The impact of the continuing Israel-Hamas war and Israel-Hezbollah and Israel-Iran conflicts 
 In response to Hamas s terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against Hamas and, later, Hezbollah commenced in parallel to both terrorist organizations continued rocket and terror attacks. In addition, Israel has come under attack by Iran and has responded to such attacks militarily. 
 
 Such geopolitical and military instabilities, impact of sanctions and trade restrictions imposed as a result thereof, operational disruptions at facilities located in Israel as a result of military call-ups of the Company s employees in Israel, closure of the offices there, potential impact of litigation and risks related to supply chain disruptions, might affect the Company's business and results from operations. 
 
 As of November 5, 2024 (date of filing), our facilities in Israel remain open and operate at normal level. The extent and duration of the current war and other conflicts, the possibility of further spread of the conflict to other countries in the region as well as involving other political and military entities in the Middle East, poses risks to our operations and may lead to disruptions which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 While sales to customers in Israel is relatively a small portion of our revenues, our operations in Israel include offices, that are the workplace for key executives including our chief executive officer, as well as two manufacturing facilities located in the central part of Israel which source approximately 25 percent of our total worldwide revenues. We have implemented a contingency plan that we believe will secure supply of materials and logistics, build safety stock of finished goods and transfer these goods to our distribution centers outside of Israel. 
 
 We continue to take measures with regards to the safety of our employees. We may, however, determine at some point in the future to temporarily discontinue production in Israel for the safety of our employees. We could also face future production slowdowns or interruptions at either manufacturing location in Israel due to personnel absences or resource constraints such as the inability to source materials for production.

Overview of Financial Results 
 VPG reports in three product segments: Sensors, Weighing Solutions, and Measurement Systems. The Sensors segment is comprised of the foil resistor and strain gage operating segments. The Weighing Solutions segment is comprised of specialized modules and systems used to precisely measure weight, force torque, and pressure. The Measurement Systems segment is comprised of highly specialized systems for steel production, materials development, and safety testing. 
 Net revenues for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024 were 75.7 million versus 85.9 million for the comparable prior year period. Net loss attributable to VPG stockholders for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024 were (1.4) million, or (0.10) per diluted share, versus 6.3 million, or 0.46 per diluted share, for the comparable prior year period. 
 Net revenues for the nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024 were 233.9 million versus 265.5 million for the comparable prior year period. Net earnings attributable to VPG stockholders for the nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024 were 9.1 million, or 0.68 per diluted share, versus 21.5 million, or 1.57 per diluted share, for the comparable prior year period. 
 The results of operations for the fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 include items affecting comparability as listed in the reconciliations below. The reconciliations below include certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), including adjusted gross profits, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per diluted share, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted gross profits, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per diluted share, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA do not have uniform definitions. These measures, as calculated by VPG, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because each presents what management views as our core operating results for the relevant period. The adjustments to the applicable GAAP measures relate to occurrences or events that are outside of our core operations, and management believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures provides a consistent basis to evaluate our operating profitability and performance trends across comparable periods. In addition, the Company has historically provided these or similar non-GAAP measures and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company s performance and in comparing the Company s financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors. Management believes that the Company s non-GAAP measures are regarded as supplemental to its GAAP financial results.

 Financial Metrics 
 We utilize several financial measures and metrics to evaluate performance and assess the future direction of our business. These key financial measures and metrics include net revenues, gross profit margin, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, and inventory turnover. 
 Gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of net revenues. Gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold, but could also include certain other period costs. Gross profit margin is a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost-cutting programs and our ability to contain fixed costs. 
 End-of-period backlog is one indicator of potential future sales. We include in our backlog only open orders that have been released by the customer for shipment in the next twelve months. If demand falls below customers forecasts, or if customers do 
 -27- 

not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty. Therefore, backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results expected for future periods. 
 Another important indicator of demand in our industry is the book-to-bill ratio, which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period compared with the amount of product shipped during that period. A book-to-bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that revenues may increase in future periods. Conversely, a book-to-bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of lower demand and may foretell declining sales. The book-to-bill ratio is also impacted by the timing of orders, particularly from our project-based product lines. 
 We focus on inventory turnover as a measure of how well we manage our inventory. We define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory (computed using each quarter-end balance) for this same period. A higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital. 
 The quarter-to-quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business. The following tables show net revenues, gross profit margin, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, and inventory turnover for our business as a whole and by segment during the five quarters beginning with the third quarter of 2023 through the third quarter of 2024.

 Net revenues for the third fiscal quarter of 2024 decreased 2.1 from the second fiscal quarter of 2024 and decreased 11.8 from the third fiscal quarter of 2023 across all three reporting segments. 
 Net revenues in the Sensors reporting segment decreased 2.3 compared to the second fiscal quarter of 2024 and decreased 13.3 from the third fiscal quarter of 2023. The year-over-year decrease in Sensors reporting segment revenues was primarily attributable to lower sales of precision resistors in the Test and Measurement and AMS markets. Sequentially, the decrease primarily reflected lower sales of advanced sensors in the Other markets, mainly for consumer applications, which was partially offset by higher sales of precision resistors in the AMS and Test and Measurement end markets. 
 
 Net revenues in the Weighing Solutions reporting segment decreased 8.3 from the second fiscal quarter of 2024 and decreased 13.1 from the third fiscal quarter of 2023. Sequentially, the decreases in revenues were primarily attributable to lower sales in the Industrial Weighing, Transportation, and Other markets. The year-over-year decrease in revenues was mainly attributable to lower sales in our Transportation and Industrial Weighing markets, as well as in our Other markets primarily for precision agriculture and medical applications. 
 Net revenues in the Measurement Systems reporting segment increased 6.2 from the second fiscal quarter of 2024 and decreased 8.2 from the third fiscal quarter of 2023. Sequentially, the increase in revenue was primarily due to higher sales of Diversified Technical Systems Inc. ("DTS") products in the AMS and Transportation markets. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to decreased revenue in the Steel, Transportation, and in our Other markets. 
 Overall gross profit margin in the third fiscal quarter of 2024 decreased 1.9 as compared to the second fiscal quarter of 2024 and decreased 1.9 from the third fiscal quarter of 2023. 
 Sequentially, the decrease in the gross profit margins in the Sensors and Weighing Solutions reporting segments was partially offset by an increase in the gross profit margin in the Measurement Systems reporting segment. 
 In the Sensors reporting segment, sequentially, the lower gross profit margin was primarily due to lower volume and temporary operational and labor inefficiencies. 
 In the Weighing Solutions reporting segment, the sequential decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower volum and unfavorable product mix. The sequential increase in the gross profit margins in the Measurement Systems reporting segment was a result of higher volume and favorable product mix. 
 -29- 

Compared to the third fiscal quarter of 2023, the Measurement Systems reporting segment had a higher gross profit margins, while the Sensors and Weighing Solutions reporting segments had lower gross profit margins. 
 The Sensors reporting segment had a lower gross profit margin the third fiscal quarter of 2024 as compared to the third fiscal quarter of 2023 mainly due to lower volume. 
 
 The Weighing Solutions reporting segment had a lower gross profit margin as compared to the third fiscal quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable product mix. In the Measurement Systems reporting segment, the gross profit margin was slightly higher as compared to the third fiscal quarter of 2023 primarily due to favorable product mix, partially offset by lower volume. 
 Optimize Core Competence 
 The Company s core competencies include our innovative deep technical and applications-specific expertise to add value to our customers' products, our strong brands and customer relationships, our focus on operational excellence, our ability to select and develop our management teams, and our proven M A strategy. We continue to optimize all aspects of our development, manufacturing and sales processes, including by increasing our technical sales efforts; continuing to innovate in product performance and design; and refining our manufacturing processes. 
 Our Sensors segment research group developed innovations that enhance the capability and performance of our strain gages, while simultaneously reducing their size and power consumption as part of our advanced sensors product line. We believe this unique foil technology will create new markets as customers design in these next generation products in existing and new applications. Our development engineering team is also responsible for creating new processes to further automate manufacturing and improve productivity and quality. Our advanced sensors manufacturing technology also offers us the capability to produce high-quality foil strain gages in a highly automated environment, which we believe results in reduced manufacturing and lead times, improved quality and increased margins. As a sign of our commitment to these businesses, we signed a long-term lease for a state-of-the-art facility that has been constructed in Israel. 
 Our design, research, and product development teams, in partnership with our marketing teams, drive our efforts to bring innovations to market. We intend to leverage our insights into customer demand to continually develop and roll out new, innovative products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing, addressing changing customer needs and industry trends in terms of form, fit, and function. 
 We also seek to achieve significant production cost savings through the transfer, expansion, and construction of manufacturing operations in countries such as India, Japan, and Israel, where we can benefit from improved efficiencies or available tax and other government-sponsored incentives. In the past several years, we incurred restructuring expense related to closing and downsizing of facilities as part of the manufacturing transitions of our load cell products to facilities in India and China, which marked key milestones in our ongoing strategic initiatives to align and consolidate our manufacturing footprint. 
 Acquisition Strategy 
 We expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions where opportunities present themselves to grow and expand our segments. Historically, our growth and acquisition strategy had been largely focused on vertical product integration, using our foil strain gages in our load cell products, and incorporating those products into our weighing solutions. In recent years, we widened our acquisition strategy to include a broader set of precision measurement systems and product companies. 
 We expect to expand our expertise, and our acquisition focus, outside our traditional vertical approach to other precision measurement solutions, including in the fields of measurement of force, weight, pressure, torque, tilt, motion, and acceleration. We believe acquired businesses will benefit from improvements we implement to reduce redundant functions and from our current global manufacturing and distribution footprint. On September 30, 2024, the Company acquired Nokra Optische Prueftechnik und Automation GmbH, a Germany-based, privately held maker of precision measuring and testing equipment for manufacturing. Please see our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 30, 2024, for more information. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development R D will continue to play a key role in our efforts to introduce innovative products to generate new sales and to improve profitability. We expect to continue to expand our position as a leading supplier of precision foil technology products. We believe our R D efforts should provide us with a variety of opportunities to leverage technology, products, and our manufacturing base in order to ultimately improve our financial performance. 
 -30- 

Cost Management 
 To be successful, we believe we must seek new strategies for controlling operating costs. Through automation in our plants, we believe we can optimize our capital and labor resources in production, inventory management, quality control, and warehousing. We are in the process of moving some manufacturing to more cost effective locations. This may enable us to become more efficient and cost competitive, and also maintain tighter controls of the operation. 
 Production transfers, facility consolidations, and other long-term cost-cutting measures require us to initially incur significant severance and other exit costs. We are realizing the benefits of our restructuring through lower labor costs and other operating expenses and expect to continue reaping these benefits in future periods. However, these programs to improve our profitability also involve certain risks which could materially impact our future operating results, as further detailed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2024. 
 We are evaluating plans to further reduce our costs by consolidating additional manufacturing operations. These plans may require us to incur restructuring and severance costs in future periods. While streamlining and reducing fixed overhead, we are exercising caution so that we will not negatively impact our customer service or our ability to further develop products and processes. 
 Goodwill 
 We test the goodwill in each of our reporting units for impairment at least annually, as of the first day of our fourth quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that a possible impairment may have been incurred. Determining whether to test goodwill for impairment, and the application of goodwill impairment tests, require significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Changes in these estimates could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit. A slowdown or deferral of orders for a business, with which we have goodwill associated, could impact our valuation of that goodwill. 
 Foreign Currency 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries. U.S. GAAP requires that entities identify the functional currency of each of their subsidiaries and measure all elements of the financial statements in that functional currency. A subsidiary s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. In cases where a subsidiary is relatively self-contained within a particular country, the local currency is generally deemed to be the functional currency. However, a foreign subsidiary that is a direct and integral component or extension of the parent company s operations generally would have the parent company s currency as its functional currency. We have subsidiaries that fall into each of these categories. 
 Foreign Subsidiaries which use the Local Currency as the Functional Currency 
 Our operations in Europe, Canada, and certain locations in Asia primarily generate and expend cash using local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency. For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated condensed balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments do not impact the results of operations and are reported as a separate component of equity. 
 For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the consolidated condensed statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies. 
 Foreign Subsidiaries which use the U.S. Dollar as the Functional Currency 
 Our operations in Israel and certain locations in Asia primarily generate cash in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars. Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the results of operations. While these subsidiaries transact most business in U.S. dollars, they may have significant costs, particularly related to payroll, which are incurred in the local currency and significant lease assets and liabilities.

The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to decreased revenue in the Steel, Transportation, and in our Other markets. Sequentially, the increase in revenue was primarily due to higher sales of Diversified Technical Systems Inc. ("DTS") products in the AMS and Transportation markets. 
 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Measurement Systems segment were as follows:

The year-over-year adjusted gross profit margin was higher due to product mix. The sequentially higher adjusted gross profit margin reflected lower volume and favorable product mix. 
 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general, and administrative SG A expenses are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands) : 
 Fiscal quarter ended Nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Total SG A expenses 26,337 26,558 80,232 80,472 As a percentage of net revenues 34.8 30.9 34.3 30.3

 Restructuring Costs 
 Restructuring costs reflect the cost reduction programs implemented by the Company. Restructuring costs are expensed during the period in which the Company determines it will incur those costs and all requirements for accrual are met. Because these costs are recorded based upon estimates, actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs. If the initial estimates are too low or too high, the Company could be required either to record additional expense in future periods or to reverse part of the previously recorded charges. 
 The Company recorded 0.1 million and 1.2 million of restructuring costs during the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and 0.9 million and 1.4 million of restructuring costs during the nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Restructuring costs were comprised primarily of employee termination costs, including severance and statutory retirement allowances, in connection with various cost reduction programs. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Foreign currency exchange loss for the fiscal quarter and nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024 was higher compared to the comparable prior year periods mainly due to volatility in the global currency markets and the strengthening of the U.S dollar against the Japanese yen which increased the value of yen-based liabilities relative to the dollar..

The following table analyzes the components of the line Other on the consolidated condensed statements of operations (in thousands) : 
 Fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Foreign currency exchange gain (loss) (2,912) 1,283 (4,195) Interest income 370 543 (173) Pension expense (8) (72) 64 Other (96) (83) (13) (2,646) 1,671 (4,317) 
 Nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Foreign currency exchange gain (loss) (36) 2,138 (2,174) Interest income 1,192 1,265 (73) Pension expense (28) (217) 189 Other (213) (221) 8 915 2,965 (2,050) 
 Foreign currency exchange gains and losses represent the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the fiscal quarter and nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024, the change in foreign currency exchange gains and losses during the periods, as compared to the prior year periods, is largely due to exposure to currency fluctuations with the Israeli shekel, the Japanese Yen, the Canadian dollar and the British pound. 
 Income Taxes 
 VPG calculates the tax provision for interim periods using an estimated annual effective tax rate methodology based on projected full-year pre-tax earnings among the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate with adjustments for discrete items. The effective tax rate for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024 was 343.2 compared to 27.6 for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024 was higher than the prior year period primarily due to changes in the mix of worldwide income and an increase in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for the nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024 was 41.6 compared to 27.0 for the nine fiscal months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024 was higher than the prior year period primarily due to changes in the mix of worldwide income and an increase in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes imposed by the U.S., various states, and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Each jurisdiction establishes rules that set forth the years which are subject to examination by its tax authorities. While the Company believes the tax positions taken on its tax returns for each jurisdiction are supportable, they may still be challenged by the jurisdiction's tax authorities. In anticipation of such challenges, the Company has established reserves for tax-related uncertainties. These liabilities are based on the Company s best estimate of the potential tax exposures in each respective jurisdiction. It may take a number of years for a final tax liability in a jurisdiction to be determined, particularly in the event of an audit. If an uncertain matter is determined favorably, there could be a reduction in the Company s tax expense. An unfavorable determination could increase tax expense and could require a cash payment, including interest and penalties.

Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 
 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and projected cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 On March 20, 2020, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2020 Credit Agreement among the Company, the lenders named therein, Citizens Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as joint lead arrangers and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association as agent for such lenders (the Agent ), pursuant to which the terms of the Company s multi-currency, secured credit facility were revised to provide a secured revolving facility (the 2020 Revolving Facility in an aggregate principal amount of 75.0 million, with a sublimit of 10.0 million which can be used for letters of credit for the account of the Company or its subsidiaries that are parties to the Credit Agreement. The proceeds of the 2020 Revolving Facility may be used on an ongoing basis for working capital and general corporate purposes. The aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Revolving Facility may be increased by a maximum of 25.0 million upon the request of the Company, subject to the terms of the 2020 Credit Agreement. The 2020 Credit Agreement terminates on March 20, 2025. 
 On May 5, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement Amendment ), by and among the Company, the lenders named therein, Citizens Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as joint lead arrangers and the Agent, as agent for such lenders. The Credit Agreement Amendment amended the 2020 Credit Agreement. The primary purpose of the changes made in the Credit Agreement Amendment were to update the interest rate provisions to replace LIBOR with SOFR for U.S. dollar denominated loans as well as update the other applicable reference borrowing rates for foreign currency loans which took effect on June 15, 2023. Interest payable on amounts borrowed under the 2020 Revolving Facility is based upon the following: (a) for revolving credit loans denominated in US Dollars, the SOFR rate plus applicable credit spread; and (b) for revolving credit loans denominated in foreign currencies, at other applicable local reference rates plus an interest margin. Depending upon the Company s leverage ratio, an interest rate margin ranging from 1.50 to 2.75 per annum is added to the applicable SOFR rate to determine the interest payable on the SOFR loans. The Company is required to pay a quarterly fee of 0.25 per annum to 0.40 per annum on the unused portion of the 2020 Revolving Facility, which is determined based on the Company s leverage ratio each quarter. Additional customary fees apply with respect to letters of credit. 
 On August 15, 2024, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2024 Credit Agreement among the Company, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and HSBC as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunner, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, as agent for such lenders, pursuant to which the 2020 Credit Agreement, as amended, was amended and restated to, among other things, extend the maturity date from March 20, 2025 to August 15, 2029 and adjust the interest rate and commitment fee. The 2024 Credit Agreement provides for a multi-currency, secured credit facility (the 2024 Revolving Facility in an aggregate principal amount of 75.0 million, with a sublimit of 10.0 million which can be used for letters of credit for the account of the Company or its subsidiaries that are parties to the 2024 Credit Agreement, the proceeds of which may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, and a portion of which were used to refinance the 2020 Revolving Facility. The Company may elect to make loans under the 2024 Revolving Facility in US Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Sterling, Japanese Yen or such other freely convertible foreign currency. 
 The obligations of the Company under the 2024 Credit Agreement are secured by pledges of stock in certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries, as well as guarantees by substantially all of the Company s domestic subsidiaries. The obligations of the Company and the guarantors under the 2024 Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all the assets (excluding real estate) of the Company and such guarantors. The 2024 Credit Agreement restricts the Company from paying cash dividends and requires the Company to comply with other customary covenants, representations, and warranties, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios. The financial maintenance covenants include an interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with its financial maintenance covenants at September 28, 2024. If the Company is not in compliance with any of these covenant restrictions, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable. 
 Our business has historically generated significant cash flow. For the nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was 13.0 million compared to 27.1 million in the comparable prior year period. Our net cash used in investing activities for the nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024 was lower compared to the prior year period mainly due to lower capital spending. Our net cash used in financing activities for the nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024 was significantly higher when compared with the prior year period due to the stock repurchases made during the period. 
 Approximately 92 and 92 of our cash and cash equivalents balance at September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. 
 See the following table for the percentage of cash and cash equivalents, by region, at September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 -38- 

September 28, 2024 December 31, 2023 Israel 39 36 Asia 24 22 Europe 10 17 Germany 14 5 United States 8 8 Canada 5 12 100 100 
 We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the United States, the majority of which is deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above, a significant portion of our cash and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. The Company will continue to evaluate its cash needs, however we currently do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate funds in excess of what is already planned. The Company will evaluate the possibility of repatriating future cash provided such repatriation can be accomplished in a tax efficient manner. In addition, we expect existing domestic cash, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as debt repayment and capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. 
 If we should require more capital in the United States than is generated by our domestic operations, for example, to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the United States through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher tax expense, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We consider the majority of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as of September 28, 2024, to be indefinitely reinvested. 
 Adjusted free cash flow generated during the nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024, was 6.7 million. We refer to the amount of cash provided by operating activities 13.0 million) in excess of our capital expenditures 7.0 million) and net of proceeds from the sale of assets 0.8 million) as adjusted free cash flow. 
 The following table summarizes the components of net cash at September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands) : 
 September 28, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 81,077 83,965 Third-party long-term debt: Revolving debt 32,000 32,000 Deferred financing costs (617) (144) Total third-party debt 31,383 31,856 Net cash 49,694 52,109 
 Measurements such as adjusted free cash flow and net cash" do not have uniform definitions and are not recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Such measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity. However, management believes that adjusted free cash flow is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions, and that an analysis of net cash assists investors in understanding aspects of our cash and debt management. These measures, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 Our financial condition as of September 28, 2024 remains strong, with a current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of 4.4 to 1.0, as compared to a ratio of 3.9 to 1.0 at December 31, 2023. 
 Cash paid for property and equipment for the nine fiscal months ended September 28, 2024 was 7.0 million compared to 9.8 million in the comparable prior year period. 
 As of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no material changes in the market risks previously disclosed in Part II, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are: (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, including our CEO and CFO, believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must consider the benefits of controls relative to their costs. Inherent limitations within a control system include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by unauthorized override of the control. While the design of any system of controls is to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of disclosure controls, such design is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and such assumptions, while reasonable, may not take into account all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be prevented or detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During our last fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

So long as such modifications do not decrease the interest rates or fees payable in connection with the RC Loans and are for the purpose of allocating amounts ratably among the Lenders, changing the mechanics and other necessary changes to this Agreement to make the increase effective, each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to enter into such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on their behalf as the Agent shall deem appropriate; provided that the interests rates, Unused Commitment Fees or letter of credit fees as are described in Article 3 (Letters of Credit) applicable to any RC Commitments of the Lenders prior to such modification shall not, in any event, be decreased pursuant to such modification; and provided, further, that if such additional Lender is entitled to interest rates, Unused Commitment Fees or such letter of credit fees as are described in Article 3 (Letters of Credit) in excess of those provided for the RC Commitments outstanding at the time of such modification, then such higher interest and fee rates shall be made to apply to all RC Commitments of any Lender thereafter. As a condition precedent to such an increase, the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent (a) a certificate of each Loan Party (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by an authorized officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of the Borrower, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained herein and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and (B) no Default or Event of Default exists, and (b) legal opinions and documents consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date, to the extent requested by the Agent. On or about the date of such increase, all outstanding RC Loans shall be reallocated among the Lenders (including any new Lenders) in accordance with the Lenders' respective revised ratable share of the RC Commitment. 2.3.3 Adjustments for Incremental Loans. On the effective date of any such increase or addition, (i) any Lender increasing (or, in the case of any newly added Lender, extending) its RC Commitment shall make available to the Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase or addition and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other Lenders, each Lender's portion of the outstanding RC Loans of all the Lenders to equal its revised Applicable Percentage of such outstanding RC Loans, and the Agent shall make such other adjustments among the Lenders with respect to the RC Loans then outstanding and amounts of principal, interest, commitment fees and other amounts paid or payable with respect thereto as shall be necessary, in the opinion of the Agent, in order to effect such reallocation and (ii) the Borrower shall be deemed to have repaid and reborrowed all outstanding RC Loans as of the date of any increase (or addition) in the RC Commitments (with such reborrowing to consist of the types of RC Loans, with related Interest Periods if applicable, specified in a notice delivered by the Borrower, in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.2 (Borrowing Notice)). The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid but, in respect of each Term Benchmark Loan, shall not be subject to indemnification by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Subsection 2.9.5 (Breakage) if the deemed payment occurs other than on the last day of the related Interest Periods. Within a reasonable time after the effective date of any increase or addition, the Agent shall, and is hereby authorized and directed 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -52- to, revise the Schedule 1.1 to reflect such increase or addition and shall distribute such revised Schedule 1.1 to each of the Lenders and the Borrower, whereupon such revised Schedule 1.1 shall replace the old Schedule 1.1 and become part of this Agreement. 2.4 Reserved. 2.5 Reserved. 2.6 Lenders' Obligations Several. Each Lender is severally bound by this Agreement, but there shall be no joint obligation of the Lenders under this Agreement. The failure of any Lender to make any share of the RC Loans or fulfill any obligations respecting Letters of Credit to be made or fulfilled by it on the date specified for the RC Loans or such obligations shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation to make its share of the RC Loans or fulfill other obligations on such date, but neither any Lender nor the Agent shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make a share of the RC Loans or fulfill other obligations to be made or fulfilled by such other Lender. 2.7 Notes. Upon the request of any Lender, the aggregate principal amount of each Lender's share of the RC Commitment and RC Loans shall be evidenced by a note to be issued by the Borrower to each Lender in substantially the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A. 2.8 Fees to Lenders. 2.8.1 Unused Commitment Fees. (a) The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the account of each of the Lenders, a commitment fee (the Unused Commitment Fee ), which shall accrue at the Commitment Fee Rate on the average daily Unused Commitment Fee Base from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date on which all obligations under the RC Commitments have been paid in full and the RC Commitments have been terminated. Accrued Unused Commitment Fees shall be payable in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date (for the quarter then most recently ended) and on the date on which the RC Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Closing Date. All Unused Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (b) Unused Commitment Fee Base means an amount at any time equal to (a) the amount of the RC Commitment less (b) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding RC Loans and the face amount of outstanding Letters of Credit. The term Commitment Fee Rate when used with respect to the average daily Unused Commitment Fee Base shall mean the following: 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -53- If the Leverage Ratio Is: Then the Commitment Fee Rate Is: 1.00 to 1.00 and 2.00 to 1.00 and 2.50 to 1.00 and 3.00 to 1.00 0.40 The Commitment Fee Rate shall be 0.20 from the date hereof until the delivery of the Officer's Compliance Certificate for the period ending September 30, 2024 pursuant to Subsection 6.1.3 (Delivery of Officer's Compliance Certificates). Thereafter, the Commitment Fee Rate shall be adjusted three (3) Business Days after the Officer's Compliance Certificate is delivered pursuant to Subsection 6.1.3 (Delivery of Officer's Compliance Certificates); provided, however, at any time that the Borrower shall have not delivered such certificate at the time specified in Subsection 6.1.3 (Delivery of Officer's Compliance Certificates), until such time as such certificate is so delivered to the Agent, the Commitment Fee Rate shall be the highest rate set forth above; provided further, if the Borrower incorrectly reports or calculates the Leverage Ratio, the Agent, in its sole discretion, may change the Unused Commitment Fee retroactively based on the Commitment Fee Rate that should have been in effect for such period that the Leverage Ratio was incorrectly reported or calculated. The foregoing shall not limit any rights of the Lenders to receipt of the Default Rate, if applicable. 2.8.2 Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Banks and/or Lenders, as applicable, such letter of credit fees as are described in Article 3 (Letters of Credit). 2.8.3 Other Fees. The Borrower shall pay such other fees as the Borrower has otherwise agreed to pay to the Agent, the Issuing Banks, and/or the Lenders. 2.9 Interest. 2.9.1 Rates. The RC Loans shall bear interest at the Borrower's option (subject to the limitation and conditions set forth in this Section 2.9) (a) for RC Loans denominated in Dollars, at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin or at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin, (b) for RC Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, at the Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin or the Adjusted Term CORRA Rate plus the Applicable Margin, (c) for RC Loans denominated in Euros, at the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin, (d) for RC Loans denominated in Sterling, at the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR plus the Applicable Margin, and (e) for RC Loans denominated in Yen, at the Adjusted TIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to Subsection 2.9.6 (Default Rate; Late Fee) shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Term Benchmark Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. Computations of interest shall be made, (i) for RC Loans denominated in any currency other than Canadian Dollars and Sterling, on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed (unless the Agent 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -54- shall determine that market practice for a particular rate or currency is to base it on a 365/366 day year) and (ii) for RC Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars and Sterling, on the basis of a 365- day year (or, solely with respect to RC Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, a 366-day year in any leap year) and the actual number of days elapsed. Changes in the rate of interest resulting from changes in the Alternate Base Rate and the Canadian Prime Rate shall take place immediately without notice or demand of any kind. The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Canadian Prime Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, Adjusted Term CORRA Rate, Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, EURIBOR Rate, Adjusted TIBOR Rate, TIBOR Rate, Adjusted Daily Simple RFR or Daily Simple RFR shall be determined by the Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 2.9.2 Applicable Margin. Except as set forth in Subsection 2.9.3 (Adjustments to Applicable Margin), the term Applicable Margin when used with respect to (i) Base Rate Loans and Canadian Base Rate Loans, shall mean 0.25 and (ii) Term Benchmark Loans and RFR Loans, as applicable, shall mean the following: Leverage Ratio Applicable Margin for Term Benchmark Loans and RFR Loans 1.00 to 1.00 and 2.00 to 1.00 and 2.50 to 1.00 and 3.00 to 1.00 3.00 2.9.3 Adjustments to Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin shall be 1.75 for Term Benchmark Loans and RFR Loans from the date hereof until the delivery of the Officer's Compliance Certificate for the period ending September 30, 2024 pursuant to Subsection 6.1.3 (Delivery of Officer's Compliance Certificates). Thereafter, the Applicable Margin shall be adjusted three (3) Business Days after the delivery of the Officer's Compliance Certificate delivered pursuant to Subsection 6.1.3 (Delivery of Officer's Compliance Certificates); provided, however, at any time that the Borrower shall have not delivered such certificate at the time specified in Subsection 6.1.3 (Delivery of Officer's Compliance Certificates), until such time as such certificate is so delivered to the Agent, the Applicable Margin shall be the maximum amount for the applicable type of RC Loan set forth above and, provided further, if the Borrower incorrectly reports or calculates the Leverage Ratio, the Agent, in its sole discretion, may change interest retroactively based on the Applicable Margin that should have been in effect for such period that the Leverage Ratio was incorrectly reported or calculated. The foregoing shall not limit any rights of the Lenders to receipt of the Default Rate, if applicable. 2.9.4 Interest Election. (a) Unless otherwise elected by the Borrower, (i) all RC Loans denominated in Dollars shall be Base Rate Loans bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, (ii) all RC Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than Canadian Dollars) shall be CBR Loans bearing interest at a rate equal to the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Alternative Currency plus the CBR Spread, and (iii) all RC Loans denominated in 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -55- Canadian Dollars shall be Canadian Base Rate Loans bearing interest at the Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin. (b) The Borrower may, upon prior written notice to the Agent by the time that a borrowing notice would be required if the Borrower were requesting a borrowing of the same type as such election under Section 2.2 (Borrowing Notice) (or, in each case, with respect to borrowings on the Closing Date, such shorter period of time as the Lenders may agree to in their sole discretion) (in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit C for new advances and in the form of an Interest Election Request to convert or continue existing RC Loans), and subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, elect to borrow money that will bear interest based on the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin, the Adjusted Term CORRA Rate plus the Applicable Margin, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin, the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR plus the Applicable Margin, or the Adjusted TIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin, as applicable, or to convert a portion of the RC Loans (in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate borrowing) to bear interest based on the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin, the Adjusted Term CORRA Rate plus the Applicable Margin, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin, the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR plus the Applicable Margin, or the Adjusted TIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin, as applicable. Any such election may be made with respect to a principal amount designated in such notice and equal to at least One Million Dollars 1,000,000) and integral multiples of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars 200,000) in excess of such minimum, for the Interest Period next ensuing, as designated by the Borrower in its notice. If any notice delivered pursuant to this Subsection 2.9.4(b) requests a Term Benchmark borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. (c) Reserved. (d) The Borrower may not convert any outstanding RC Loans to Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans if at the time of such conversion there shall exist a Default or an Event of Default. (e) If an interest rate based on a Term Benchmark is elected, such interest rate shall remain in effect for the Interest Period selected and such interest rate shall not otherwise be converted to another interest rate prior to the expiration of the Interest Period except as otherwise required by this Subsection 2.9.4. If an Interest Period for any Term Benchmark Loan would otherwise commence on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall commence on the next Business Day for Term Benchmark Loans. (f) Each Term Benchmark Loan shall, on the last day of the applicable Interest Period, automatically convert into a Base Rate Loan bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, CBR Loan bearing interest at a rate equal to the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Alternative Currency plus the CBR Spread, or Canadian Base Rate Loan bearing interest at a rate equal to the Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin, as applicable, unless the Agent has received an Interest Election Request that the Borrower has 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -56- elected to continue such RC Loan as a Term Benchmark Loan at least three (3) Business Days prior thereto. (g) The Borrower may not elect an interest rate based on a Term Benchmark if such election would require the Agent to administer concurrently a combination of elective rates of interest based on a Term Benchmark and/or a combination of Interest Periods that exceed an aggregate of five. (h) No Interest Period may be elected that would end later than the Maturity Date. 2.9.5 Breakage. In the event that the Borrower makes a prepayment of any Term Benchmark Loans on a day other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period, including any such prepayment as a result of an assignment required by Subsection 2.15.2 (Replacement of Lenders), or makes a prepayment of any RFR Loan on a day other than the applicable Interest Payment Date, including any such prepayment as a result of an assignment required by Subsection 2.15.2 (Replacement of Lenders), or converts any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of the applicable Interest Period, or fails to borrow a Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, or fails to convert, continue, or prepay an RC Loan to a Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan on the date specified in the applicable notice, the Borrower will pay to the Agent, upon demand, for the account of the affected Lenders, any cost, loss or expense incurred as a result thereof. Each affected Lender shall certify the amount of such cost, loss or expense (but excluding loss of profit) to the Borrower, which certification and statement shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. 2.9.6 Default Rate; Late Fee. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (whether or not the Agent has accelerated payment of the Notes), or after maturity or judgment has been rendered on the Notes, the Borrower's right to select interest rate options shall cease and the unpaid principal of the RC Loans shall, upon written notice from the Agent (which notice may be retroactive to the Event of Default), bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans plus two percent (2 (the Default Rate ). 2.9.7 Source of Funds. It is acknowledged that the provisions of this Agreement relating to the funding of Term Benchmark Loans by the Lenders are included only for the purpose of determining the rate of interest to be paid and any other amounts owing under this Agreement in connection with such election, and each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of that portion of the principal amount of the RC Loans in any manner it sees fit. Nonetheless, all such determinations shall be made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained its Term Benchmark Loans through the purchase of corresponding deposits or, in the case of a Benchmark Replacement, such comparable funding source for such Benchmark Replacement. 2.9.8 Interest Due with Certain Repayments and Prepayments. In addition to payments of accrued interest as provided in Subsection 2.9.1 (Rates), accrued interest on all repayments and prepayments of RC Loans on the Maturity Date (whether such date is the originally contemplated Maturity Date or an earlier date on which the Commitment is terminated) shall be due and payable at the time of such repayments and prepayments, it being understood that 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -57- this Subsection 2.9.8 does not interfere with the obligation of the Borrower pursuant to Subsection 2.9.5 (Breakage) with respect to any such repayment or prepayment. 2.10 Increased Costs; Unavailability. 2.10.1 Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law or any determination to comply with the Borrower's request to fund RC Loans in Alternative Currencies shall: (a) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate or Adjusted TIBOR Rate, as applicable) or any Issuing Bank; (b) subject any Recipient to any Tax of any kind whatsoever (except for Indemnified Taxes, Excluded Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of such definition, and Connection Income Taxes) with respect to this Agreement, any Loan Document, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any RC Loan made by it, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or (c) impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the applicable offshore interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or RC Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or other Recipient of making or maintaining any RC Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such RC Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or Issuing Bank, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 2.10.2 Capital Requirements. If any Lender or Issuing Bank reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or Issuing Bank or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the RC Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -58- as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered. 2.10.3 Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth, in reasonable detail, the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Subsections 2.10.1 (Increased Costs Generally) or 2.10.2 (Capital Requirements) and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 2.10.4 Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; provided, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.10 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 2.10.5 Reserved. 2.10.6 Laws Affecting Interest Rate Availability. If any Lender shall determine that it has become unlawful or impossible (other than as set forth in Subsection 2.10.7 (Alternate Rate of Interest) below) for such Lender (or any of its lending offices) to make or maintain Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans (or Term Benchmark Loans of a specified duration) due to (a) the introduction of, or any change in, any Law or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, or (b) compliance by any Lender (or any of its lending offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Agent and the Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower and the other Lenders. Thereafter, until the Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make such Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans (or Term Benchmark Loans of the specified duration) and the right of the Borrower to convert any RC Loan or continue any RC Loan as such shall be suspended and thereafter the Borrower may select only Base Rate Loans, CBR Loans, or Canadian Base Rate Loans (or Term Benchmark Loans of other durations), as applicable, hereunder, and (ii) if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain a RC Loan as a Term Benchmark Loan to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, the applicable RC Loan shall immediately be converted to a Base Rate Loan, CBR Loan, or Canadian Base Rate Loan, as applicable. 2.10.7 Alternate Rate of Interest. (a) Subject to clauses (b) through (f) below, if: 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -59- (i) the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) (i) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted Term CORRA Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, the EURIBOR Rate or the Adjusted TIBOR Rate or the TIBOR Rate (including because the Relevant Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis), for the applicable Agreed Currency and such Interest Period or (ii) at any time, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple RFR, Daily Simple RFR or RFR for the applicable Agreed Currency; or (ii) the Agent is advised by the Requisite Lenders that (i) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark borrowing, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted Term CORRA Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate or the Adjusted TIBOR Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency and such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such borrowing for the applicable Agreed Currency and such Interest Period or (ii) at any time, the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for the applicable Agreed Currency will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such borrowing for the applicable Agreed Currency; then the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until (x) the Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the Borrower delivers a new Interest Election Request in accordance with the terms of Subsection 2.9.4 (Interest Election) or a new borrowing request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.2 (Borrowing Notice), (A) for Loans denominated in Dollars, any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any RC Loans to, or continuation of any RC Loans as, a Term Benchmark borrowing and any borrowing request that requests a Term Benchmark borrowing shall instead be deemed to be an Interest Election Request or a borrowing request, as applicable, for a Base Rate Loan, and (B) for Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any RC Loans to, or continuation of any RC Loans as, a Term Benchmark borrowing and any borrowing request that requests a Term Benchmark borrowing or an RFR borrowing, in each case, for the relevant Benchmark, shall be ineffective; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one type of borrowing, then all other types of borrowings shall be permitted. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan in any Agreed Currency is outstanding on the date of the Borrower's receipt of the notice from the Agent referred to in this Subsection Error! Reference source not found. with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until (x) the Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the Borrower delivers a new Interest Election Request in accordance with the terms of Subsection 2.9.4 (Interest Election) or a new borrowing request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.2 (Borrowing Notice), (A) for Loans denominated in Dollars, any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), be converted by the Agent to, and shall constitute, a Base Rate Loan on such day; and (B) for Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -60- succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day) bear interest at the Central Bank Rate (or in the case of Canadian Dollars, the Canadian Prime Rate) for the applicable Alternative Currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that, if the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate (or in the case of Canadian Dollars, the Canadian Prime Rate) for the applicable Alternative Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected Term Benchmark Loans denominated in any Alternative Currency shall, at the Borrower's election prior to such day: (i) bear interest at the Alternate Rate, (ii) be prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (iii) solely for the purpose of calculating the interest rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan, such Term Benchmark Loan denominated in any Alternative Currency shall be deemed to be a Term Benchmark Loan denominated in Dollars and shall accrue interest at the same interest rate applicable to Term Benchmark Loans denominated in Dollars at such time and (2) any RFR Loan shall bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Alternative Currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that, if the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Alternative Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected RFR Loans denominated in any Alternative Currency, at the Borrower's election, shall either (I) bear interest at the Alternate Rate, or (II) be prepaid in full immediately. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement with respect to Dollars and/or Canadian Dollars for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark (including any related adjustments) for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement with respect to any Agreed Currency for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Requisite Lenders. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, the Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document and subject to the proviso below in this clause (d), with respect to a Loan denominated in Canadian Dollars, if a Term CORRA Reelection Event and its related Benchmark 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -61- Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then- current Benchmark, then the applicable Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder or under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, this clause (d) shall not be effective unless the Agent has delivered to the Lenders and the Borrower a Term CORRA Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent shall not be required to deliver a Term CORRA Notice after the occurrence of a Term CORRA Reelection Event and may do so in its sole discretion. (e) The Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (g) below and (v) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Subsection 2.10.7, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Subsection 2.10.7. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Rate, Term CORRA, EURIBOR Rate, or TIBOR Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. (g) Upon the Borrower's receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Term Benchmark borrowing or RFR borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, either (x) the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any request for a Term Benchmark borrowing denominated in Dollars into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to a Base Rate Loan, (y) any Term Benchmark borrowing or RFR borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than Canadian Dollars) shall be ineffective, or (z) the Borrower will be deemed to have 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -62- converted any request for a Term Benchmark borrowing denominated in Canadian Dollars into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to a Canadian Base Rate Loan. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Alternate Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Alternate Base Rate. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan in any Agreed Currency is outstanding on the date of the Borrower's receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until such time as a Benchmark Replacement for such Agreed Currency is implemented pursuant to this Subsection 2.10.7, (A) for Loans denominated in Dollars, any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), be converted by the Agent to, and shall constitute, a Base Rate Loan; and (B) for Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day) bear interest at the Central Bank Rate (or in the case of Canadian Dollars, the Canadian Prime Rate) for the applicable Alternative Currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that, if the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate (or in the case of Canadian Dollars, the Canadian Prime Rate) for the applicable Alternative Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected Term Benchmark Loans denominated in any Alternative Currency shall, at the Borrower's election prior to such day: (a) be prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (b) solely for the purpose of calculating the interest rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan, such Term Benchmark Loan denominated in any Alternative Currency shall be deemed to be a Term Benchmark Loan denominated in Dollars and shall accrue interest at the same interest rate applicable to Term Benchmark Loans denominated in Dollars at such time and (2) any RFR Loan shall bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Alternative Currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that, if the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Alternative Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected RFR Loans denominated in any Alternative Currency, at the Borrower's election, shall either (I) bear interest at the Alternate Rate or (II) be prepaid in full immediately. 2.11 Purpose. The proceeds of the RC Loans shall be used by the Borrower to refinance existing Indebtedness and for working capital needs and general corporate purposes of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors. No part of the proceeds of any RC Loan and no Letter of Credit will be used, whether directly or indirectly, for any purpose that entails a violation of any of the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, including Regulation T, Regulation U and Regulation X. 2.12 Mechanics of Payments: Borrower Payments. 2.12.1 Manner of Making Payments. All payments on account of principal of and interest on the RC Loans, the Unused Commitment Fee, and all other amounts otherwise payable to the Lenders under this Agreement shall be made to the Agent. All payments shall be made by the Borrower to the Agent in Dollars (unless otherwise expressly specified) in immediately available funds, without counterclaim or setoff or other payment; provided, however, that payments shall be made, free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding for, any Taxes 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -63- only to the extent provided for in Section 2.14 (Taxes). Unless otherwise specified, all payments by the Borrower shall be made by 12:00 noon (Eastern Time) (or, in the case of payments required to be made in a currency other than Dollars, at such time as the Agent shall specify) on the due date for such payment and if by wire transfer, to the account of the Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Borrower, or by the Agent debiting an account of the Borrower with the Agent. The failure by the Borrower to make a payment by 12:00 noon (Eastern Time) (or, in the case of payments required to be made in a currency other than Dollars, at such time as the Agent shall specify) shall not constitute an Event of Default if such payment is made on the due date; however, any payment made after such time on such due date shall be deemed made on the next Business Day for the purpose of interest and reimbursement calculations. If, for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. 2.12.2 Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Agent. Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks (such payment being a Borrower Required Payment that the Borrower will not make the Borrower Required Payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made the Borrower Required Payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to), distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such Borrower Required Payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at the NYFRB Rate. 2.12.3 Disbursements from Agent to Lenders. The Agent shall promptly remit to each Lender its pro rata share of payments received pursuant to Subsection 2.12.1 (Manner of Making Payments) in immediately available funds, except that all reimbursement payments in respect of losses, out-of-pocket expenses, funding losses or like matters shall be retained by the Agent or remitted to the Lenders according to their respective appropriate entitlement to such reimbursement and except as otherwise provided with respect to Defaulting Lenders. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, payments from the Borrower shall be applied first to fees, then to interest (to the extent then payable), then to principal of Base Rate Loans and Canadian Base Rate Loans and then to principal of Term Benchmark Loans and RFR Loans (and among such Term Benchmark Loans, first to those with the earliest expiring Interest Periods). 2.12.4 Authorization to Deduct Funds and Make RC Loans in Satisfaction of Obligations. At any time the Borrower fails to make a payment of principal, interest, reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit, fees, costs, expenses or other amounts that are required to be paid by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents on or prior to the time at which a failure to make such payment would become an Event of Default, the Agent may elect that such payment be made from the proceeds of borrowings made hereunder, whether made following a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.2 (Borrowing Notice) or a deemed request as provided in this Subsection 2.12.4 or may 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -64- be deducted from any deposit account of the Borrower maintained with the Agent. The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes (i) the Agent to make a borrowing for the purpose of paying each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents and agrees that all such amounts charged shall constitute Loans, and that all such borrowings shall be deemed to have been requested pursuant to Section 2.2 (Borrowing Notice), and (ii) the Agent to charge any deposit account of the Borrower maintained with the Agent for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents. 2.12.5 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its RC Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its RC Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the RC Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective RC Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that (a) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (b) the provisions of this Subsection 2.12.5 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its RC Loans or participations in Letters of Credit to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Subsection 2.12.5 shall apply). The Borrower and each other Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent they may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower's and each other Loan Party's rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower and each other Loan Party in the amount of such participation. 2.12.6 Payments Due on Non-Business Days. Subject to Subsection 2.9.4 (Interest Election) as to payments with respect to any Loan, except in the case of any payment due on the Maturity Date, if any payment under the Loan Documents becomes due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date of such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall be included in computing interest and fees in connection with such payment. If the Maturity Date is not a Business Day, any payment due on the Maturity Date shall be due on the immediately preceding Business Day. 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -65- 2.12.7 Judgment Currency Conversion. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of any Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the Judgment Currency other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the Agreement Currency ), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Agent or any Lender from any Borrower in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Agent or any Lender in such Currency, the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under Applicable law). 2.12.8 Statements. The Agent may from time to time provide the Borrower with account statements or invoices with respect to any of the Secured Obligations (the Statements ). The Agent is under no duty or obligation to provide Statements, which, if provided, will be solely for the Borrower's convenience. Statements may contain estimates of the amounts owed during the relevant billing period, whether of principal, interest, fees or other Secured Obligations. If the Borrower pays the full amount indicated on a Statement on or before the due date indicated on such Statement, the Borrower shall not be in default of payment with respect to the billing period indicated on such Statement; provided that acceptance by the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, of any payment that is less than the total amount actually due at that time (including but not limited to any past due amounts) shall not constitute a waiver of the Agent's or the Lenders' right to receive payment in full at another time. 2.13 Mechanics of Payments; Lender Payments. 2.13.1 Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Agent. Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to proposed the date on which it is scheduled to fund any amount hereunder to the Agent any amount payable by a Lender under this Agreement (such payment being a Lender Required Payment that such Lender will not make available to the Agent its Lender Required Payment, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made its Lender Required Payment available on such date in accordance with Section 2.2 (Borrowing Notice) and may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to), make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its Lender Required Payment to the Agent then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -66- greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the Alternate Base Rate plus Applicable Margin. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its Lender Required Payment to the Agent then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's RC Loan included in the applicable borrowing; provided, that any interest received from the Borrower by the Agent during the period beginning when Agent funded the borrowing until such Lender pays such amount shall be solely for the account of the Agent. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make its Lender Required Payment to the Agent. Any Lender that fails to make a Lender Required Payment upon receipt of notice therefor shall not be entitled to vote on any matters that it otherwise would be entitled to vote on under this Agreement until it makes such payment. 2.14 Taxes. 2.14.1 Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Law. If a Withholding Agent shall be required by applicable Law (as determined in the good faith of the Withholding Agent) to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and, if such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made. 2.14.2 Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of Subsection 2.14.1 (Payments Free of Taxes), each Loan Party shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of the Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of any Other Taxes. 2.14.3 Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within thirty (30) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.14) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -67- 2.14.4 Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within thirty (30) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of Subsection 11.6.4 (Successors and Assigns Participations) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this Subsection 2.14.4. 2.14.5 Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.14, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. 2.14.6 Status of Lenders. Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), on or prior to the date it becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request by the Borrower or the Agent), such properly completed and executed documentation that is reasonably requested by the Borrower or Agent or prescribed by applicable Law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in paragraphs (a), (b)(i)-(iv) and (c) of this Section) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person, any Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent, but only if such Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable: (a) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax; 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -68- (b) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, duly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN- E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; (ii) duly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit K-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate and (y) duly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit K-2 or Exhibit K-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit K-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; or (v) executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. (c) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -69- Solely for purposes of this paragraph, FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 2.14.7 Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.14 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14), it shall pay to the indemnifying party within thirty (30) days of receipt an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid under this Section 2.14 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the indemnifying party, upon the request of the indemnified party, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the indemnifying party pursuant to this Subsection 2.14.7 (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the indemnified party in the event the indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Subsection 2.14.7, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Subsection 2.14.7 the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Subsection 2.14.7 shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 2.14.8 Survival. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower and the Lenders contained in this Section 2.14 (Taxes) shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, and the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the Commitments. 2.14.9 Defined Term. For purposes of this Section 2.14 (Taxes), the term 'Lender' includes any Issuing Bank and the term 'applicable Law' includes FATCA. 2.15 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. 2.15.1 Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.10 (Increased Costs; Unavailability), or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14 (Taxes), then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its RC Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -70- or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10 (Increased Costs; Unavailability) or Section 2.14 (Taxes), as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 2.15.2 Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.10 (Increased Costs; Unavailability), or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14 (Taxes), or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender does not approve an amendment to this Agreement or any other Loan Document which is approved by the Requisite Lenders and which is required to also be approved by such Lender to be effective pursuant to Section 11.5 (Amendments, Waivers and Consents), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.6 (Successors and Assigns)), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 2.10 (Increased Costs; Unavailability) 2.14 (Taxes)) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that: (a) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Agent (and in circumstances where its consent would be required under Section 11.6 (Successors and Assigns), the Issuing Banks, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld) and shall have paid to the Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 11.6 (Successors and Assigns), (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its RC Loans and participations in Letters of Credit, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Subsection 2.9.5 (Breakage)) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.10 (Increased Costs; Unavailability) or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14 (Taxes), such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter, and (d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Law. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that (i) an assignment required pursuant to this Subsection 2.15.2 may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Agent (solely to the extent the Agent's consent would have been required for such assignment if it were made 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -71- strictly pursuant to Section 11.6) and the assignee (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform as to which the Agent and such parties are participants), and (ii) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof; provided that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender, provided that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto. 2.16 Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: (a) the Unused Commitment Fee payable pursuant to Subsection 2.9.1 (Unused Commitment Fees) shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender; (b) any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 2.12 (Mechanics of Payments; Borrower Payments) or otherwise) or received by the Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.11 (Right of Setoff) shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank hereunder; third, to cash collateralize the LC Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with this Section 2.16; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender's potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) cash collateralize future LC Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with this Section 2.16; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or the Issuing Banks against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or Unreimbursed Drawings in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.3 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -72- (Requirements for Each Loan/Letter of Credit) were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and Unreimbursed Drawings owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or Unreimbursed Drawings owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in the Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments without giving effect to clause (d) below. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto; (c) such Defaulting Lender shall not have the right to vote on any issue on which voting is required (other than to the extent expressly provided in Section 11.5 (Amendments, Waivers and Consents)) and the Commitment and RC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (d) if any LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then: (i) all or any part of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only (x) to the extent that such reallocation does not, as to any non- Defaulting Lender, cause such non-Defaulting Lender's RC Exposure to exceed its RC Commitment; (ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Agent cash collateralize, for the benefit of the Issuing Banks, the Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.10 (Cash Collateralization) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding; (iii) if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Subsection 2.8.2 (Letter of Credit Fees) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized; (iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Subsections 2.8.1 (Unused Commitment Fees) and Subsection 2.8.2 (Letter of Credit Fees) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Applicable Percentages; and (v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -73- letter of credit fees payable under Subsection 2.8.2 (Letter of Credit Fees) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and (e) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend, renew, extend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and such Defaulting Lender's then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100 covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 3.10 (Cash Collateralization), and LC Exposure related to any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.16(d)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein); If (i) a Bankruptcy Event or a Bail-In Action with respect to a Lender Parent shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) any Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, such Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless such Issuing Bank shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to such Issuing Bank to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder. In the event that each of the Agent, the Borrower and each Issuing Bank agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's RC Commitment and on the date of such readjustment such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. 2.17 Additional Borrowers. 2.17.1 Request for Additional Borrowers. Provided there exists no Default or Event of Default, the Borrower may from time to time, with the consent of the Agent, request that one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries be made additional borrowers under this Agreement and the Loan Documents with respect to the RC Loans and RC Commitment. At the time of sending such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten (10) Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders). 2.17.2 Lender Elections to Accept Additional Borrower. Each Lender desiring to accept such additional Borrower (which determination shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of such Lender) shall notify the Agent in writing within such time period that it agrees to the addition of such Subsidiary as a Borrower hereunder. In the event that all Lenders provide such notice to the Agent within the time period specified, the designated Subsidiary shall become a Borrower hereunder pursuant to and subject to the terms of this Section 2.17. 2.17.3 Execution of Documentation by Additional Borrower. Any Subsidiary sought to be added as an additional Borrower under the Loan Documents pursuant to Subsection 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -74- 2.17.1 (Request for Additional Borrowers) and approved by the Lenders pursuant to clause Subsection 2.17.2 (Lender Election to Accept Additional Borrower) above shall execute such additional documentation as the Agent may reasonably request, which shall include, but is not limited to, joinders to this Agreement and the U.S. Security Agreement or, to the extent any such Subsidiary is not a Domestic Subsidiary, another security agreement in substantially the same form as the U.S. Security Agreement. Further, in the event that an additional Borrower is designated in accordance with the terms hereof, each Lender authorizes the Agent to execute, on their behalf, such amendments and supplements to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as the Agent shall deem necessary or reasonably desirable. The Borrower and any additional Borrowers designated pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.17 (Additional Borrowers) shall be jointly and severally liable and all obligations of such Person hereunder, under the other Loan Documents or arising in connection herewith or therewith shall be included as Obligations and Secured Obligations. 2.18 Reserved. 2.19 Returned Payments.. If, after receipt of any payment which is applied to the payment of all or any part of the Obligations (including a payment effected through exercise of a right of setoff), the Agent or any Lender is for any reason compelled to surrender such payment or proceeds to any Person because such payment or application of proceeds is invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be void or voidable as a preference, impermissible setoff, or a diversion of trust funds, or for any other reason (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Agent or such Lender in its discretion), then the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued and this Agreement shall continue in full force as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the Agent or such Lender. The provisions of this Section 2.18 shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may have been taken by the Agent or any Lender in reliance upon such payment or application of proceeds. The provisions of this Section 2.18 shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 2.20 Banking Services, Swap Agreements, and Lender Bilateral Lines. Each Lender or Affiliate thereof providing Banking Services for, or having Swap Agreements or Lender Bilateral Lines with, any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof shall deliver to the Agent, promptly after entering into such Banking Services, Swap Agreements, or Lender Bilateral Lines, written notice setting forth the aggregate amount of all Banking Services Obligations, Swap Agreement Obligations, and obligations under Lender Bilateral Lines of such Loan Party or Subsidiary thereof to such Lender or Affiliate (whether matured or unmatured, absolute or contingent). In furtherance of that requirement, each such Lender or Affiliate thereof shall furnish the Agent, from time to time after a significant change therein or upon a request therefor, a summary of the amounts due or to become due in respect of such Banking Services Obligations, Swap Agreement Obligations, and Lender Bilateral Lines. The most recent information provided to the Agent shall be used in determining which tier of the waterfall, contained in Section 9.3 (Proceeds of Collateral), such Banking Services Obligations, Swap Agreement Obligations and/or obligations under Lender Bilateral Lines will be placed. For the avoidance of doubt, so long as JPM or its Affiliate is the Agent, neither JPM nor any of its Affiliates providing Banking Services for, or having Swap Agreements or Lender Bilateral Lines with, any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof shall be required to provide any notice described in this Section 2.20 in respect of such Banking Services, Swap Agreements, or Lender Bilateral Lines. 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -75- ARTICLE 3 LETTERS OF CREDIT 3.1 Letters of Credit; General. 3.1.1 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request any Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars as the applicant thereof for the support of its or its Subsidiaries' obligations, in a form reasonably acceptable to such Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the term of this Agreement subject to the terms and conditions hereof. 3.1.2 If (i) any letter of credit has been previously issued by an Issuing Bank, (ii) the reimbursement obligations of the account party (the Original Letter of Credit Account Party relating to such letter of credit have been or are assumed in writing by the Borrower or Subsidiary thereof pursuant to a Permitted Acquisition or other transaction permitted under this Agreement, (iii) after giving effect to the inclusion of such letter of credit as a Letter of Credit hereunder, the provisions of Section 3.2 (Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Extension; Certain Conditions) shall not be contravened, (iv) such letter of credit satisfies all of the requirements of a Letter of Credit hereunder, and (v) the conditions of Sections 4.1 (Conditions to Effectiveness) and 4.3 (Requirements for Each Loan/Letter of Credit) are satisfied, then upon the written request (which request shall include a statement that the foregoing requirements (i) through (v), inclusive, have been satisfied) of the Borrower to such Issuing Bank (consented to in writing by such Issuing Bank) and the submission by the Borrower to the Agent of a copy of such request bearing such consent, such letter of credit shall be (from the date of such consent of such Issuing Bank) deemed a Letter of Credit for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and considered issued hereunder pursuant to the terms hereof (the terms hereof and of the other Loan Documents shall govern and prevail in the case of any conflict with the provisions of the agreement(s) pursuant to which such letter of credit had been issued (such agreement(s), the Original Letter of Credit Agreements ), and such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have released the Original Letter of Credit Account Party and the Borrower, as applicable, from the Original Letter of Credit Agreements to the extent of such conflict). Notwithstanding that any such assumed letter of credit is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the Borrower agrees that it shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder for any and all drawings under such letter of credit. 3.2 Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Extension; Certain Conditions. (a) To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or fax (or transmit through Electronic System or the Approved Borrower Portal, in each case to the extent arrangements for doing so have been approved by the respective Issuing Bank) to an Issuing Bank selected by it and to the Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment or extension, but in any event no less than three (3) Business Days) a written notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with Section 3.3 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -76- (Expiration Date), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof, and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend or extend such Letter of Credit. In addition, as a condition to any such Letter of Credit issuance, the Borrower shall have entered into a continuing agreement (or other letter of credit agreement) for the issuance of letters of credit and/or shall submit a letter of credit application, in each case, as required by the respective Issuing Bank and using such Issuing Bank's standard form (each, a Letter of Credit Agreement ). In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any Letter of Credit Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment or extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, (ii) no Lender's RC Exposure shall exceed its RC Commitment and (iii) the aggregate RC Exposure of all Lenders shall not exceed the RC Commitment. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein, no Issuing Bank shall be obligated to issue or modify any Letter of Credit if, immediately after giving effect thereto, the outstanding LC Exposure in respect of all Letters of Credit issued by such Person and its Affiliates would exceed such Issuing Bank's Issuing Bank Sublimit. Without limiting the foregoing and without affecting the limitations contained herein, it is understood and agreed that the Borrower may from time to time request that an Issuing Bank issue Letters of Credit in excess of its individual Issuing Bank Sublimit in effect at the time of such request, and each Issuing Bank agrees to consider any such request in good faith. Any Letter of Credit so issued by an Issuing Bank in excess of its individual Issuing Bank Sublimit then in effect shall nonetheless constitute a Letter of Credit for all purposes of this Agreement, and shall not affect the Issuing Bank Sublimit of any other Issuing Bank, subject to the limitations on the aggregate LC Exposure set forth in clause (i) above. (b) An Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit if: (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing, amending or extending such Letter of Credit, or request that such Issuing Bank refrain from issuing, amending or extending such Letter of Credit, or any Requirement of Law relating to such Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, the issuance, amendment or extension of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular, or any such order, judgment or decree, or law shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital or liquidity requirement (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which such Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it, or (ii) the issuance, amendment or extension of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally. 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -77- (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Article 3, each Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if there is a Defaulting Lender, unless there shall be arrangements in place satisfactory to such Issuing Bank and to the Agent, to mitigate such Issuing Bank's risk with respect to such Defaulting Lender. 3.3 Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire (or be subject to termination or non-renewal by notice from the applicable Issuing Bank to the beneficiary thereof) at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any extension of the expiration date thereof, including, without limitation, any automatic renewal provision, one year after such extension) and (ii) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date; provided that, if approved by the Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank in each of their sole discretion, a Letter of Credit may expire after the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date if arrangements acceptable to the Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank are made. 3.4 Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount or extending the term thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of the respective Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in Section 3.5 (Reimbursement), or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason, including after the Maturity Date. Each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to acquire participations pursuant to this Section 3.4 in respect of Letters of Credit and to make payments in respect of such acquired participations are absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitment. 3.5 Reimbursement. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than noon (New York time), on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received after 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the day of receipt; provided that, if such LC Disbursement is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.2 (Borrowing Notice) that such payment be financed with an RC Loan that is a Base Rate Loan in an equivalent amount. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof, and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -78- 2.13 (Mechanics of Payments; Lender Payments) with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.13 (Mechanics of Payments; Lender Payments) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Agent shall promptly pay to the respective Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.5, the Agent shall distribute such payment to the respective Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this Section 3.5 to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank, as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this Section 3.5 to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of RC Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. 3.6 Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in s Section 3.5 (Reimbursement) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, any Letter of Credit Agreement or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein or herein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) any payment by the respective Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 3.6, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Agent, the Lenders, nor any Issuing Bank, or any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit, or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, document, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms, any error in translation or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the respective Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -79- 3.7 Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank for any Letter of Credit shall, within the time allowed by applicable law or the specific terms of the Letter of Credit following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly after such examination notify the Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by fax or through Electronic System) of such demand for payment if such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that such notice need not be given prior to payment by the Issuing Bank and any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. 3.8 Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank for any Letter of Credit shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Base Rate Loans and such interest shall be due and payable on the date when such reimbursement is payable; provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 3.5 (Reimbursement), then the Default Rate shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this Section 3.8 shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 3.5 (Reimbursement) to reimburse such Issuing Bank for such LC Disbursement shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. 3.9 Replacement and Resignation of an Issuing Bank. (a) An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 3.13 (Letter of Credit Fees). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (A) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (B) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit then outstanding and issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or extend or otherwise amend any existing Letter of Credit. (b) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, any Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing Bank at any time upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders, in which case, such resigning Issuing Bank shall be replaced in accordance with paragraph (a) above. 3.10 Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Agent or the Required Lenders demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this Section 3.10, the Borrower shall deposit 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -80- in an account or accounts with the Agent, in the name of the Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders (the LC Collateral Account ), an amount in cash equal to 105 of the amount of the LC Exposure as of such date plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in Subsection 9.1.11 (Insolvency). The Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral in accordance with this Section 3.10 as and to the extent the aggregate amount of LC Exposure exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Each such deposit shall be held by the Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing or any other provision of this Article 3, if any LC Exposure remains outstanding after the expiration date specified Section 3.3 (Expiration Date), the Borrower shall immediately deposit in the LC Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to 105 of such LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the LC Collateral Account and the Borrower hereby grants the Agent a security interest in the LC Collateral Account and all moneys or other assets on deposit therein or credited thereto. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, if any, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Agent and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in the LC Collateral Account. Moneys in the LC Collateral Account shall be applied by the Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed, together with related fees, costs, and customary processing charges, and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Requisite Lenders), be applied to satisfy other Secured Obligations.

In connection with any such bid (i) the Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles (ii) each of the Secured Parties' ratable interests in the Obligations which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the governing documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Requisite Lenders or their permitted assignees under the terms of this Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Requisite Lenders contained in Section 11.5 (Amendments, Waivers and Consents) of this Agreement), (iv) the Agent 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -133- on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to each of the Secured Parties, ratably on account of the relevant Obligations which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership interests, limited partnership interests or membership interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and/or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of Obligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Secured Parties pro rata with their original interest in such Obligations and the equity interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of such Obligations shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Obligations of each Secured Party are deemed assigned to the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Party shall execute such documents and provide such information regarding the Secured Party (and/or any designee of the Secured Party which will receive interests in or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such credit bid. 10.9 Certain ERISA Matters.

(b) In addition, unless sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or such Lender has provided another representation, warranty and covenant as provided in sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Agent, each Co-Arranger and their respective Affiliates, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, that none of the Agent, any Co-Arranger or any of their respective Affiliates is a fiduciary with respect to the Collateral or the assets of such Lender (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related to hereto or thereto). (c) The Agent and each Co-Arranger hereby informs the Lenders that each such Person is not undertaking to provide investment advice or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and that such Person has a financial interest in the transactions contemplated hereby in that such Person or an Affiliate thereof (i) may receive interest or other payments with respect to the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments, this Agreement and any other Loan Documents (ii) may recognize a gain if it extended the Loans, the Letters of Credit or the Commitments for an amount less than the amount being paid for an interest in the Loans, the Letters of Credit or the Commitments by such Lender or (iii) may receive fees or other payments in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, the Loan Documents or otherwise, including structuring fees, commitment fees, arrangement fees, facility fees, upfront fees, underwriting fees, ticking fees, agency fees, administrative agent or collateral agent fees, utilization fees, minimum usage fees, letter of credit fees, fronting fees, deal-away or alternate transaction fees, amendment fees, processing fees, term out premiums, banker's acceptance fees, breakage or other early termination fees or fees similar to the foregoing. 10.10 Flood Laws.

(b) Although the Approved Borrower Portal and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies implemented or modified by the Agent from time to time (including, as of the Closing Date, a user ID/password authorization system), each Lender, each Issuing Bank, and the Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (i) the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure, (ii) the Agent is not responsible for approving or vetting administrators, representatives, or contacts of the Borrower added to the Approved Borrower Portal, and (iii) there may be confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution. Each Lender, each Issuing Bank, and the Borrower hereby approves distribution of Borrower Communications through the Approved Borrower Portal and understands and assumes the risks of such distribution. (c) THE APPROVED BORROWER PORTAL IS PROVIDED AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE . THE APPLICABLE PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER COMMUNICATIONS, OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE APPROVED BORROWER PORTAL AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE APPROVED BORROWER PORTAL AND THE BORROWER COMMUNICATIONS.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE APPLICABLE PARTIES HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY LOAN PARTY, ANY LENDER, ANY ISSUING BANK OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF THE BORROWER'S TRANSMISSION OF BORROWER COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET OR THE APPROVED BORROWER PORTAL. (d) Each Lender, each Issuing Bank and the Borrower agrees that the Agent may, but (except as may be required by applicable law) shall not be obligated to, store the Borrower Communications on the Approved Borrower Portal in accordance with the Agent's generally applicable document retention procedures and policies.

In the event of a discrepancy between any telephonic and any written notice, the written notice shall control. Any Lender giving any notice to the Borrower shall send simultaneously a copy of such notice to the Agent. 11.1.2 Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the Borrower, any Loan Party, the Lenders, the Agent and the Issuing Banks hereunder may be delivered or furnished by using Electronic System, Approved Electronic Platform or Approved Borrower Portal, as applicable, and in each case pursuant to procedures approved by the Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices pursuant to Section 2.13 (Mechanics of Payments; Lender Payments) or Section 3.5 (Reimbursement) unless otherwise agreed by the Agent and the applicable Lender.

DMS_US.362473592.16 -138- 11.2 Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.10 (Increased Costs; Unavailability), 2.9.5 (Breakage), 2.14 (Taxes), 2.18 (Returned Payments), 11.14 (Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver), 11.16.1 (Termination of Security) and Article 10 (Agency) shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof. 11.3 No Implied Waivers. No failure or delay on the part of the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege under the Loan Documents and no course of dealing between the Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, on the other hand, shall operate as a waiver of any such right, power or privilege. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under the Loan Documents, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such rights, powers or privileges, precludes any other or further exercise of any such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies expressly provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies that the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or shall constitute a waiver of the right of the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to take any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. Any waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom that is given shall be effective only if in writing and only for the limited purposes expressly stated in the applicable waiver. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. 11.4 Severability. Every provision of the Loan Documents is intended to be severable. If any term or provision of the Loan Documents shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected or impaired thereby. Any invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term or provision of the Loan 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -139- Documents in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. 11.5 Amendments, Waivers and Consents. 11.5.1 In General. Except as expressly set forth in Subsection 2.10.7 (Alternate Rate of Interest) and Section 2.3 (Increases in RC Commitment), this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may not be amended or modified except by a written instrument describing such amendment or modification executed by the Borrower and the Agent with the consent of the Lenders as provided in this Subsection 11.5.1. With the written consent of the Requisite Lenders, the Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, enter into agreements that modify, amend or supplement this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and with such consent, the Agent may waive compliance with any provision of any of the Loan Documents, all as referred to in this Subsection 11.5.1. However, no such modification, amendment, supplement or waiver shall: (a) increase the maximum amount of the Commitment or reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, in each case of any Lender without such Lender's written consent (including any such Lender that is a Defaulting Lender), (b) extend the Maturity Date or any scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any date for payment of interest, fees, or other Obligations payable to any Lender, or reduce the amount of, waive, or excuse any such payment, in each case without such Lender's written consent (including any such Lender that is a Defaulting Lender), (c) reduce or forgive any interest payable hereunder (including any amendment or modification to the interest rate provisions hereof to decrease the rate of interest payable to any Lender) without such Lender's written consent (including any such Lender that is a Defaulting Lender); provided that the written consent of the Requisite Lenders, rather than the consent of all Lenders, shall be sufficient to waive imposition of the Default Rate pursuant to Subsection 2.9.6 (Default Rate; Late Fee) or amend or modify the financial covenants in this Agreement (or any defined terms used therein), (d) reduce or forgive the amount of the fees payable under Subsection 2.9.1 (Unused Commitment Fees) or any other fees payable to any Lender without such Lender's written consent (including any such Lender that is a Defaulting Lender), other than any fee payable solely to the Agent; provided that the written consent of the Requisite Lenders, rather than the consent of all Lenders, shall be sufficient to amend or modify the financial covenants in this Agreement (or any defined terms used therein), (e) change Subsection 2.12.5 (Sharing of Payments by Lenders) in a manner that would alter the manner in which payments are shared, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (other than any Defaulting Lender), (f) change Section 9.3 (Proceeds of Collateral) in a manner that would alter the order of application of proceeds of Collateral without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (other than any Defaulting Lender),

(other than in respect of the imposition of the Default Rate) after such Event of Default shall have occurred without each Lender's written consent (other than any Defaulting Lender) (but the Requisite Lenders may direct the Agent to forbear under such circumstances), or (k) except as provided in Subsection 10.7(c) (Collateral Matters), without the prior written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, (x) subordinate, or have the effect of subordinating, the Obligations hereunder to any other Indebtedness, or (y) subordinate, or have the effect of subordinating, the Liens securing the Obligations to Liens securing any other Indebtedness. No such agreement shall (i) amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Agent or the Issuing Banks hereunder without the prior written consent of the Agent or each Issuing Bank, as the case may be (it being understood that any amendment to Section 2.16 (Defaulting Lenders) shall require the consent of the Agent and the Issuing Banks) or (ii) amend or modify the provisions of Article 3 without the prior written consent of the Agent and the Issuing Banks. 11.5.2 Exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.5 or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) any Lender that has requested that it not receive material, non-public information concerning the Borrower, and that is therefore unable or unwilling to vote with respect to an issue arising under this Agreement, will agree to vote, and will be deemed to have voted, its Commitment under this Agreement pro rata in accordance with the percentage of Commitments voted in favor of, and the percentage of Commitments voted against, any such issue under this Agreement. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.5 or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Agent may, with the consent of the 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -141- Borrower only, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency. (c) The Agent may also amend Schedule 1.1 to reflect assignments entered into pursuant to Section 11.6 (Successors and Assigns). (d) each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent on its behalf, and without its further consent (but with the consent of the Borrower and the Agent), to amend and restate this Agreement if, upon giving effect to such amendment and restatement, such Lender shall no longer be a party to this Agreement (as so amended and restated), the Commitments of such Lender shall have terminated, such Lender shall have no other commitment or other obligation hereunder and shall have been paid in full all principal, interest and other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement (and for the avoidance of doubt, such Lender will continue to have the rights that survive termination of this Agreement with respect to such Lender). 11.6 Successors and Assigns. 11.6.1 Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of an Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (a) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 11.6.2 (Assignments by Lenders), (b) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 11.6.4 (Participations) or (c) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of Subsection 11.6.6 (Certain Pledges) (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of an Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants to the extent provided in Subsection 11.6.4 (Participations) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 11.6.2 Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the RC Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: (a) Minimum Amounts. (i) In the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the RC Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -142- (ii) in any case not described in the preceding paragraph (i), the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes RC Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the RC Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than 5,000,000, unless each of the Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consent (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). (b) Pro Rata Assignment. Each assignment shall include a pro rata portion of such Lender's RC Commitment and RC Loans. (c) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by paragraph (a) of this Subsection 11.6.2 and, in addition: (i) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) shall be required unless (x) a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (y) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof; and (ii) the consent of the Agent and the Issuing Banks (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments to a Person who is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that no consent of an Issuing Bank shall be required if an Event of Default occurs with respect to the Borrower under Subsection 9.1.11 (Insolvency) and such Issuing Bank has no outstanding Letters of Credit at that time. (d) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of 5,000, and the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

DMS_US.362473592.16 -143- obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Subsection 2.9.5 (Breakage), Section 2.10 (Increased Costs; Unavailability), Section 2.14 (Taxes) and Section 11.14 (Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver) with respect to the facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Subsection 11.6.2 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Subsection 11.6.4 (Participations). 11.6.3 Register. (a) The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the RC Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Banks, and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Bank, and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (b) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in Subsection 11.6.2(d) (Assignment and Assumption) and any written consent to such assignment required by Subsection 11.6.2(c) (Required Consents), the Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 3.4 (Participations), Section 3.5 (Reimbursement), Subsection 2.13.1 (Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Agent), Section 2.12.5 (Sharing of Payments by Lenders) or Subsection 11.14.3 (Reimbursement by Lenders), the Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. 11.6.4 Participations. (a) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Agent, the Issuing Banks, or the Borrower, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the RC Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -144- obligations, and (iii) the Borrower, the Agent, the other Lenders and the Issuing Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant's interest in the RC Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. Any Lender may furnish any information concerning the Borrower in its possession from time to time to prospective Participants; provided that such Lender shall require any such prospective Participants to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality of such information as provided in Section 11.13 (Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality; Advertisement). For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Subsection 11.14.3 (Reimbursement by Lenders) with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participants. (b) Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, restatement, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, restatement, modification or waiver with respect to the matters specifically referred to in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), and (i) of Section 11.5 (Amendments, Waivers and Consents) that affect such Participant. Subject to Subsection 11.6.5 (Limitations upon Participant Rights) below, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Subsection 2.9.5 (Breakage), Section 2.10 (Increased Costs; Unavailability) and Section 2.14 (Taxes) (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Subsection 2.14.6 (Status of Lenders) (it being understood that the documentation required under Subsection 2.14.6 (Status of Lenders) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Subsection 11.6.2 (Assignments by Lenders); provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.15 (Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders) and Section 2.12 (Mechanics of Payments; Borrower Payments) as if it were an assignee under Subsection 11.6.2 (Assignments by Lenders); and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.10 (Increased Costs; Unavailability) or Section 2.15 (Taxes), with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower's request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.15.2 (Replacement of Lenders) with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also 

DMS_US.362473592.16 -145- shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.11 (Right of Setoff) as though it were a Lender, provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Subsection 2.12.5 (Sharing of Payments by Lenders) as though it were a Lender. 11.6.5 Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.10 (Increased Costs; Unavailability) than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14 (Taxes) unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Subsection 2.14.6 (Status of Lenders) as though it were a Lender. Nothing in this Subsection 11.6.5 is intended to override limitations on Participants under Subsection 11.6.4 (Participations). 11.6.6 Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 11.7 Calculations and Financial Data. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, calculations under this Agreement shall be made and financial data and terms referred to in this Agreement shall be prepared and interpreted both as to classification of items and as to amounts in accordance with GAAP. 11.8 Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings of the several sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 11.9 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc. 11.9.1 Governing Law. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents (other than those containing a contrary express choice of law provision) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York (excluding the laws applicable to conflicts or choice of law), but giving effect to federal laws applicable to national banks. Each of the Lenders and the Agent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, notwithstanding the governing law provisions of any applicable Loan Document, any claims brought against the Agent by any Secured Party relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document, the Collateral or the consummation or administration of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York. 11.9.2 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any U.S. federal or New York state court sitting in New York, New York, and any appellate court from any
