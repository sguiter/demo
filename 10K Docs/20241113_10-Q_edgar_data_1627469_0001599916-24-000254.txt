ITEM 2 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain statements, other than purely historical information,
including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions
upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements. 

These forward-looking statements generally are identified
by the words believes, project, expects, anticipates, estimates, 
 intends, strategy, plan, may, will, would, will
be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. 

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations
and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking
statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could
have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes
in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting
principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should
not be placed on such statements. 

Company Overview 

The Company operates through its wholly owned subsidiary Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd. Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd. primarily focuses
on selling used cameras, offering photo session services in Tokyo and Kansai, and running online advertising across various channels,
among other activities. On April 17, 2017, Photozou Koukoku obtained a license to operate as a used goods merchant in Japan. 

Corporate History 

Photozou Holdings, Inc., ("Photozou Holdings,"
or the "Company"), was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 29, 2014, with the purposes to engage
in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware (the
"DGCL"). 

On January 13, 2017, Mr. Koichi Ishizuka was appointed
as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. 

On January 18, 2017, we changed our name from Exquisite
Acquisition, Inc. to Photozou Holdings, Inc. 

On May 31, 2018, the Company entered into and consummated
a Stock Purchase Agreement with Koichi Ishizuka, our President, CEO, and Director. At the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Koichi
Ishizuka transferred to the Company, 10,000 shares of common stock of Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation Photozou
Koukoku ), which represented all of its issued and outstanding shares, in consideration of 1,000,000 JPY 9,190 USD as of the exchange
rate May 31, 2018). The Company has since gained a 100 interest in the issued and outstanding shares of Photozou Koukoku s common
stock and Photozou Koukoku is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company and Photozou Koukoku were under common control
at the time of the acquisition. 

Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd. was incorporated under
the laws of Japan on March 14, 2017. Currently, Photozou Koukoku is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The Company s primary business
is focused on online advertising and the sale of used cameras. 

On July 31, 2023, the Company acquired a website (https://photozou.jp/)
in consideration of JPY 1 (nil in USD) from a related party, Photozou Co. Ltd., a company controlled by Koichi Ishizuka, CEO, which resulted
in the transaction being considered a transfer between entities under common control. The website https://photozou.jp/ is designed for
free photo sharing, and may, in addition to other features, offer users the option to store pictures on the website for a nominal fee. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our cash balance is 35,183 as of August 31, 2024.
Our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize
funds from Koichi Ishizuka, our sole Officer and Director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for filing fees,
and professional fees. Koichi Ishizuka, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to
the company. 

Total Assets 

We recorded total assets of 331,426 and
 156,413 as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively. The difference between the periods is primarily due to prepaid
and other current assets during the nine months ended August 31, 2024. 

Revenue 

We recorded total revenue of 55,445 and 11,837 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. The variance
between periods is primarily attributable to greater service revenue sold for the three months ended August 31, 2024. 

We recorded total revenue of 138,735 and 54,383
for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. The variance between periods is primarily attributable to
greater service revenue sold for the nine months ended August 31, 2024. 

Net Loss 

We recorded a net loss of 44,647 and 69,140
for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. 

We recorded a net loss of 263,855 and 181,670
for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. The variance is primarily attributable to increased
general and administrative expenses incurred during the nine months ended August 31, 2024. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
are prepared on a basis of accounting assuming that the Company is a going concern that contemplates realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is in the early stage of operations and has net loss from inception and negative
cash flows. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will offer
noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue-producing
contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur, it may
substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions or other
arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company
will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

ITEM 3 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item.

ITEM 4 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s Report on Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief
financial officer to
allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of August 31,
2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our chief executive officer, with the participation of our chief
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The officers
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report due to
material weaknesses identified below. 

The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: domination
of management by two individuals without adequate compensating controls, lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors,
resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; inadequate segregation
of duties consistent with control objectives, and lack of an audit committee. These material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer in connection with the above evaluation. 

Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

Internal control over financial reporting has inherent
limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing
and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns
resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management
override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a
timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into
the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting that have occurred for the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2024, that have materially or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
