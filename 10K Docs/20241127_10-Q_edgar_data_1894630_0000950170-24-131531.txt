GORES HOLDINGS IX, INC. 
 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED, INTERIM, CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 . The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination ). The Company has neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the Business Combination. The Company s Sponsor is Gores Sponsor IX, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor ). At September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from July 8, 2021, the date on which operations commenced, through September 30, 2024 relates to the Company s formation and initial public offering Public Offering described below and subsequently to the Company's search for a prospective initial Business Combination. The Company subsequently completed the Public Offering on January 14, 2022 (the IPO Closing Date ). The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its Business Combination, at the earliest. Subsequent to the Public Offering, the Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest and/or dividend income from the proceeds derived from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants (as defined below) held in the Trust Account (as defined below). Extension At the special meeting of stockholders of the Company held on January 9, 2024 (the Special Meeting ), stockholders of the Company approved a proposal to amend and restate the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the Extension Amendment to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses from January 14, 2024 to December 6, 2024 (or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors). The Company filed the Extension Amendment with the Secretary of State of Delaware on January 9, 2024. The foregoing description of the Extension Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 3.1 which is incorporated herein by reference. In connection with the vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Extension Amendment at the Special Meeting, holders of shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share, for a total aggregate redemption amount of approximately million. As a result, approximately million was distributed from the Company s trust account to redeem such shares and shares of Class A common stock remain outstanding and subject to redemption. Following the payment of the redemption price, approximately million remained in the Trust Account. Financing Upon the IPO Closing Date and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, an aggregate of was placed in a Trust Account with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the Trust Account acting as Trustee. The Company intends to finance a Business Combination with the net proceeds from its Public Offering and its sale of of Private Placement Warrants.

of such public shares of common stock if the Company does not complete the Business Combination by December 6, 2024 (or such earlier date as determined by the Company's board of directors) from the closing of the Public Offering; or (iii) the redemption of of the public shares of common stock if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by December 6, 2024 (or such earlier date as determined by the Company's board of directors) from the closing of the Public Offering, subject to the requirements of law and stock exchange rules. 	To mitigate the risk of the Company being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended), the Company has instructed the trustee with respect to the Trust Account to liquidate the U.S. government securities or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash (which may include demand deposit accounts) until the earlier of consummation of a business combination or liquidation. As a result, following such liquidation, the Company may receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account, which would reduce the dollar amount the Company s public stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. Business Combination The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Public Offering, although substantially all of the net proceeds of the Public Offering are intended to be generally applied toward consummating a Business Combination. The Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least of the assets held in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest income earned) at the time of the Company signing a definitive agreement in connection with the Business Combination. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. The Company, after signing a definitive agreement for a Business Combination, will either (i) seek stockholder approval of the Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose in connection with which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the Business Combination, for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including interest income but less taxes payable, or (ii) provide stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to the Company by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount in cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including interest income but less taxes payable. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of the Business Combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares in a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require the Company to seek stockholder approval, unless a vote is required by law or under Nasdaq rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval, it will complete its Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. Currently, the Company will not redeem its public shares of common stock in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than . In such case, the

of such net interest income to pay dissolution expenses) and (iii) as promptly as possible following such redemption, dissolve and liquidate the balance of the Company s net assets to its remaining stockholders, as part of its plan of dissolution and liquidation. The Sponsor and the Company s officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they waived their rights to participate in any redemption with respect to their Founder Shares (as defined below); however, if the Sponsor or any of the Company s officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares of common stock, they will be entitled to a pro rata share of the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the required time period. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be less than the initial public offering price per Unit in the Public Offering. Emerging Growth Company Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startup JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard.

(including in underwriters fees) consisting principally of professional and registration fees incurred through the condensed balance sheet date that are related to the Public Offering and are charged to temporary equity upon the completion of the Public Offering. Since the Company is required to classify the warrants as derivative liabilities, offering costs totaling were recorded as an expense. 

11 

shares of Class A Common Stock sold as part of the Units in the Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such public shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In accordance with SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, all Class A Common Stock has been classified outside of permanent equity. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption amount value. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit. In connection with the vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Extension Amendment at the Special Meeting, holders of shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share, for a total aggregate redemption amount of approximately million. As a result, approximately million was distributed from the Company s trust account to redeem such shares and shares of Class A common stock remain outstanding and subject to redemption. Following the payment of the redemption price, approximately million remained in the Trust Account. 
 
 amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 of such public shares of common stock if the Company does not complete the Business Combination by December 6, 2024; or (iii) the redemption of of the public shares of common stock if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by December 6, 2024, subject to the requirements of law and stock exchange rules. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had in the Trust Account. At September 30, 2024, the Company had in the Trust Account which may be utilized for Business Combinations. At December 31, 2023, the Trust Account consisted of money market funds, which are presented at fair value. At September 30, 2024, the Trust Account consisted of cash.

of the common stock sold as part of the units in the Public Offering, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of franchise and income taxes payable and less up to of such net interest which may be distributed to the Company to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In addition, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had current liabilities of and , respectively, and a working capital deficit of and ), respectively. Other amounts are related to accrued expenses owed to professionals, consultants, advisors and others who are working on seeking a Business Combination as described in Note 1. Such work is continuing after September 30, 2024 and amounts are continuing to accrue. In order to finance ongoing operating costs, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor may provide the Company with additional working capital via a Sponsor Loan (see Note 4). In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be less than the initial public offering price per unit in the Public Offering. In addition, if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination by December 6, 2024, there will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the warrants, which will expire worthless. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be less than the initial public offering price per unit in the Public Offering. In addition, if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination by December 6, 2024,

units at a price of per unit (the Units ), generating gross proceeds of . Each Unit consists of share of the Company s Class A Common Stock (the public shares ), and one-third of one redeemable common stock purchase warrant (the Warrants ). Each whole Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock. Each Warrant will become exercisable on the later of days after the completion of the Company s Business Combination or months from the closing of the Public Offering and will expire after the completion of the Company s Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. However, if the Company does not complete its Business Combination on or prior to the -month period allotted to complete the Business Combination, the Warrants will expire at the end of such period. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to file a registration statement under the Securities Act following the completion of the Business Combination covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants. The Company paid an upfront underwriting discount of of the per Unit offering price to the underwriters at the closing of the Public Offering, with an additional fee (the Deferred Discount of of the per Unit offering price payable upon the Company s completion of a Business Combination. The Deferred Discount will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event the Company completes its Business Combination. The underwriters are not entitled to any interest accrued on the Deferred Discount. The public warrants issued as part of the Units are accounted for as liabilities as there are terms and features do not qualify for equity classification in FASB ASC Topic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity. The fair value of the public warrants at December 31, 2023 was a liability of . At September 30, 2024, the fair value of the public warrants decreased to . The change in fair value of is reflected as a gain in the condensed statements of operations. All of the shares of Class A Common Stock sold as part of the Units in the Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such public shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In accordance with SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Given that the Class A Common Stock was issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants), the initial carrying value of Class A Common Stock classified as temporary equity is the allocated proceeds based on the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 470-20, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Class A Common Stock is subject to SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. The accretion or remeasurement is treated as a deemed dividend (i.e., a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital).

On January 11, 2022, the Sponsor transferred Founder Shares to each of the independent directors at their original purchase price. On February 25, 2022, the Sponsor forfeited Founder Shares following the expiration of the unexercised portion of underwriters over-allotment option, so that the Founder Shares held by the Initial Stockholders would represent of the outstanding shares of common stock. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was an aggregate of Founder Shares outstanding. The Founder Shares are identical to the Class A Common Stock included in the Units sold in the Public Offering except that the Founder Shares will automatically convert into shares of Class A Common Stock at the time of the Business Combination on a -for-one basis, subject to adjustment as described in the Company s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The sale of the Founders Shares is in the scope of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ASC 718 ). Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date. The Founders Shares were granted subject to a performance condition (i.e., the occurrence of a Business Combination). Compensation expense related to the Founders Shares is recognized only when the performance condition is probable of occurrence under the applicable accounting literature in this circumstance. As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that a Business Combination is not considered probable, and, therefore, no stock-based compensation expense has been recognized. Stock-based compensation would be recognized at the date a Business Combination is considered probable (i.e., upon consummation of a Business Combination) in an amount equal to the number of Founders Shares that ultimately vest multiplied times the grant date fair value per share (unless subsequently modified) less the amount initially received for the purchase of the Founders Shares. Private Placement Warrants The Sponsor has purchased from the Company an aggregate of whole warrants at a price of per warrant (a purchase price of approximately in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the Public Offering (the Private Placement Warrants ). Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder to purchase share of Class A Common Stock at per share. A portion of the purchase price of the Private Placement Warrants was added to the proceeds from the Public Offering to be held in the Trust Account pending completion of the Business Combination. The Private Placement Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the public warrants sold as part of the units in the Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants may be physical (cash) or net share (cashless) settled and are not redeemable so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees.

On September 30, 2024, the Company utilized recent transactions of the warrants and other factors to value the warrants due to a lack of adequate trading volume in the Company's public warrants on that date. The Public Warrants were valued at and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was deemed to be equal to the fair value of the Public Warrants because the Private Placement Warrants have similar terms and are subject to substantially the same redemption features as the Public Warrants.

 Overview 
 We are a blank check company incorporated on January 19, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a Business Combination with one or more target businesses. We completed our Public Offering on January 14, 2022. 
 We presently have no revenue, have had losses since inception from incurring formation costs and have had no operations other than the active solicitation of a target business with which to complete a business combination. 
 Restatement 
 On August 23, 2024, the Audit Committee concluded that our 2023 and 2022 financial statements, including in the Original Form 10-K, and our unaudited financial statements as of and for each of the first quarterly period in 2024 and all quarterly periods in 2023, included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the respective periods, should no longer be relied upon as a result of the discovery of potential errors for the accounting of the Company s tax provision. The Results of Operations below reflect the impact of the restated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. For more information on the impact of the restatement on the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, see footnote 2 of the financial statements included elsewhere herein and footnote 2 of the financial statements to the Form 10-K/A, respectively. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had net income of 228,309 . 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had net income of 1,931,760 of which 1,033,333 was a non-cash gain related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability and the remainder are expenses associated with normal operations. 
 21 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had net income of 4,443,680 of which 775,000) was a non-cash loss related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability and the remainder are expenses associated with normal operations. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had net income of 13,684,432 of which 258,334) was a non-cash loss related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability and the remainder are expenses associated with normal operations. 
 Our business activities during the quarter mainly consisted of identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates for a Business Combination. We believe that we have sufficient funds available to complete our efforts to effect a Business Combination with an operating business by December 6, 2024. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. 
 As indicated in the accompanying condensed unaudited financial statements, at September 30, 2024, the Company had 905,958 in cash and deferred offering costs of 18,375,000. Further, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete our Business Combination will be successful. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, we have until December 6, 2024 to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If the Company does not complete its Business Combination by December 6, 2024, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the common stock sold as part of the units in the Public Offering, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of franchise and income taxes payable and less up to 100,000 of such net interest which may be distributed to the Company to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 
 In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be less than the initial public offering price per unit in the Public Offering. In addition, if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination by December 6, 2024, there will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the warrants, which will expire worthless. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after December 6, 2024. The amount of time remaining to finalize a Business Combination does raise substantial doubt in the Company as a going concern. 
 In addition, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had current liabilities of 7,038,649 and 4,961,800, respectively, and a working capital deficit of 5,933,699) and 4,644,669), respectively. Other amounts are related to accrued expenses owed to professionals, consultants, advisors and others who are working on seeking a Business Combination as described in Note 1. Such work is continuing after September 30, 2024 and amounts are continuing to accrue. In order to finance ongoing operating costs, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor may provide the Company with additional working capital via a Sponsor Loan (see Note 5). 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
 22 

In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 for a smaller reporting company and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of ASU 2020-06 on its financial statements. 
 Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument. These changes may be the result of various factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and/or equity prices. Our business activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted solely of organizational activities and activities relating to our Public Offering and the identification of a target company for our Business Combination. As of September 30, 2024, 64,761,208 (including accrued interest and subject to reduction by the Deferred Discount due at the consummation of the Business Combination) was held in the Trust Account for the purposes of consummating our Business Combination. As of September 30, 2024, investment securities in the Company s Trust Account consist of 64,761,208 in cash. As of September 30, 2024, the effective annualized rate of return generated by our investments was approximately 0.1205 . 
 We have not engaged in any hedging activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We do not expect to engage in any hedging activities with respect to the market risk to which we are exposed. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, which was disclosed in our Form 10-K/A. We have committed significant effort and resources to the remediation and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. While we have processes to properly identify and evaluate the appropriate taxation treatment for all investment income, we are improving these processes to ensure that the nuances of such transactions are effectively evaluated in the context of the increasingly complex accounting standards. Specifically, we plan to provide enhanced access to accounting literature and research materials and consult with third party professionals regarding complex accounting matters. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time and will be continually reviewed to determine that it is achieving its objectives. We cannot guarantee that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. 
 23 

During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 As required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company; 
 2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 
 3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management concluded that , due to reliance on external consultants and insufficient risk assessment of the underlying accounting for certain instruments resulting in the Company s restatement of its financial statements as described in the Explanatory Note to its Form 10-K/A filed on November 13, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024. The Company plans to enhance its system of evaluating and implementing our internal control framework. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and the Company can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 None. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report are any of the risks described in our prospectus filed with the SEC on January 13, 2022 and our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 20, 2024, as amended on November 13, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our prospectus filed with the SEC on January 13, 2022 or our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 20, 2024, as amended on November 13, 2024, except for the below. 
 Our restatement of certain of our previously issued financial statements may impose unanticipated costs, affect investor confidence, and cause reputational harm. 
 As discussed in the Explanatory Note of our Form 10-K/A filed November 13, 2024 and as a result of errors relating for the accounting of the Company s tax provision, we have filed our Form 10-K/A, which amends the Original Form 10-K to restate the audited financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and associated report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm as well as the Company s previously issued unaudited financial statements during those periods. As a result of the identified accounting errors, we have also included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the restated unaudited financial statements for first quarter of 2024. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, unanticipated costs in connection with or related to the investigation and restatement, as well as any litigation or regulatory inquiries that may result therefrom. In addition, the investigation and restatement may negatively affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and cause us reputational harm. 
 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the errors relating for the accounting of the Company s tax provision. As a result of this material weakness, our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. We have taken measures to remediate such material weaknesses, however, if we are unable to remediate our material weaknesses in a timely manner or we identify additional material weaknesses, we may be unable to provide required financial information in a timely and reliable manner and we may incorrectly report financial information. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. The existence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of us, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities. We can give no assurance that the measures we have taken and plan to take in the future will remediate the material weakness identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. Even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, in the future 
 25 

those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements. 
 Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or our prospects. 
 The funds in our operating account and our trust account are held in banks or other financial institutions. Our cash held in non-interest bearing and interest-bearing accounts would exceed any applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance limits. Should events, including limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments occur with respect to the banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds, or that affect financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, our liquidity may be adversely affected. For example, in response to the rapidly declining financial condition of regional banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank on March 10, 2023 and May 1, 2023, respectively, and the New York State Department of Financial Services closed Signature on March 12, 2023, and the FDIC was appointed as receiver for SVB, Signature and First Republic. Although we did not have any funds in Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, First Republic Bank or other institutions that have been closed, we cannot guarantee that the banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds will not experience similar issues. 
 In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on terms favorable to us in connection with a potential business combination, or at all, and could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity, financial condition, and our prospects. Our business may be adversely impacted by these developments in ways that we cannot predict at this time, there may be additional risks that we have not yet identified, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid negative consequences directly or indirectly from any failure of one or more banks or other financial institutions. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Unregistered Sales 
 On July 8, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 15,093,750 shares of Class F Common Stock, par value 0.0001 per share, of the Company for 25,000, or approximately 0.002 per share. On January 11, 2022, the Sponsor transferred 25,000 Founder Shares to each of the independent directors at their original purchase price. On February 25, 2022, the Sponsor forfeited 1,968,750 Founder Shares following the expiration of the unexercised portion of underwriters over-allotment option, so that the Founder Shares held by the Initial Stockholders would represent 20 of the outstanding shares of common stock. 
 Prior to the IPO Closing Date, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 8,333,333 Private Placement Warrants to our Sponsor at a price of 1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds, before expenses, of 12,500,000. The Private Placement Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the public warrants sold as part of the units in the Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants may be physical (cash) or net share (cashless) settled and are not redeemable so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than our Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the Warrants. 
 The sales of the above securities by the Company were exempt from registration in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering. 
 26 

Use of Proceeds 
 On January 11, 2022, our registration statement on Form S 1 (File No. 333-261777) was declared effective by the SEC for the Public Offering pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 52,500,000 Units at an offering price to the public of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 525,000,000. 
 After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the Deferred Discount, which amount will be payable upon the consummation of our Business Combination, if consummated) and the estimated offering expenses, the total net proceeds from our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were 527,000,000, of which 525,000,000 (or 10.00 per share sold in the Public Offering) was placed in the Trust Account in the United States maintained by the trustee. 
 Through September 30, 2024, we incurred 11,016,653 for costs and expenses related to the Public Offering. At the IPO Closing Date, we paid a total of 10,500,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions. In addition, the underwriters agreed to defer 18,375,000 in underwriting commissions, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our Business Combination, if consummated. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our Public Offering as described in our final prospectus dated January 13, 2022 which was filed with the SEC. 
 Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, and our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, that we will have until December 6, 2024 to complete our Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination by December 6, 2024, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in our Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 
 As of September 30, 2024, after giving effect to our Public Offering and our operations subsequent thereto, 64,761,208 was held in the Trust Account, and we had 905,958 of unrestricted cash available to us for our activities in connection with identifying and conducting due diligence of a suitable Business Combination, and for general corporate matters. 
 In connection with the vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Extension Amendment at the Special Meeting, holders of 46,470,023 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.59 per share, for a total aggregate redemption amount of approximately 492.3 million. As a result, approximately 492.3 million was distributed from the Company s trust account to redeem such shares and 6,029,977 shares of Class A common stock remain outstanding and subject to redemption. Following the payment of the redemption price, approximately 63.8 million remained in the Trust Account.
