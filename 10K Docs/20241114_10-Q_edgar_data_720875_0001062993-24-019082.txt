Although we do not make forward-looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause our future business, financial condition, results of operations or performance to differ materially from our historical results or those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement contained in this report. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, uncertainties related to the broader economic environment affecting communities and businesses globally, including ours, as well as those factors described in the section "Risk Factors" included in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC, as well as in our other public filings with the SEC. Actual results may differ from projections as a result of these risks, additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware or which we do not currently view as material to our business.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") is designed to provide a reader of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto that are contained in this quarterly report, with a narrative from the perspective of management. You should also consider this information with the information included in our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, and our other filings with the SEC, including our quarterly and current reports that we have filed since June 30, 2024 through the date of this report. In the following MD A, we have rounded many numbers to the nearest one thousand dollars. These numbers should be read as approximate. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Our fiscal year ends on June 30. For example, reference to fiscal year 2025 refers to the year ending June 30, 2025. This report covers the three months ended September 30, 2024. Results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. 
 Overview 
 Dynatronics is a leading medical device company committed to providing high-quality restorative products designed to accelerate achieving optimal health. The Company designs, manufactures, and sells a broad range of products for clinical use in physical therapy, rehabilitation, orthopedics, pain management, and athletic training. Through its distribution channels, Dynatronics markets and sells to orthopedists, physical therapists, chiropractors, athletic trainers, sports medicine practitioners, clinics, and hospitals. The Company's products are marketed under a portfolio of high-quality, well-known industry brands including Bird Cronin, Solaris, Hausmann, PROTEAM, and Mammoth, among others. More information is available at www.dynatronics.com. 
 Results of Operations 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales decreased 1,750,000, or 18.7 to 7,602,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net sales of 9,352,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease is attributable to a reduction in overall volume for OEM customers and a general reduction in demand for the orthopedic soft bracing product category. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased 325,000, or about 14.1 , to 1,981,000, or 26.1 of net sales. By comparison, gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was 2,306,000, or 24.7 of net sales. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily by higher product margin rates in our physical therapy and rehabilitation products, partially offset by the reduction in net sales we previously discussed. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses decreased 314,000, or 12.3 , to 2,232,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,546,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decline in selling, general and administrative expenses was driven by a reduction in salaries and benefits, a decrease in sales expenses, and a reduction in repairs and maintenance expenses. 

9 

Net Other Expense 
 Net other expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was 106,000 compared to net other expense of 80,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net other expense is primarily due to a 27,000 increase in interest expense as a result of the Company's line of credit. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 Income tax provision was 9,000 and 11,000 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Deferred Income Tax Assets below for more information. 
 Net Loss 
 Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 367,000 compared to a net loss of 331,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The 36,000 increase in net loss was attributable to a decrease in gross profit of 325,000 and an increase in net other expense of 27,000, offset partially by a decrease of 314,000 in SG A expenses and a 2,000 decrease in the income tax provision. 
 Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders 
 Net loss attributable to common stockholders increased 6,000 to 534,000 for the quarter ended September 30,2024 compared to 528,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss attributable to common stockholders for the quarter is due primarily to a 36,000 increase in the net loss, partially offset by a 29,000 decrease in the deemed dividends on convertible preferred stock and accretion of discounts. On a per share basis, basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders was 0.09 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.12 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have historically financed operations through cash from operating activities, available cash reserves, draws against the line of credit, and proceeds from the sale of our equity securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 278,000 in cash and cash equivalents, compared to 484,000 as of June 30, 2024. 
 Working capital was 2,535,000 as of September 30, 2024, compared to working capital of 2,853,000 as of June 30, 2024. The current ratio was 1.3 to 1 as of September 30, 2024 and 1.4 to 1 as of June 30, 2024. Current assets were 39.2 of total assets as of September 30, 2024, and 40.7 of total assets as of June 30, 2024. 
 We believe that our cash generated from operations, current capital resources, and equity proceeds provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the next 12 months. However, the continuing effects of uncertainties in the broader economic environment on the global supply chain, higher personnel costs, and changes to customer or product mix, could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and cash and we continue to evaluate and take action, as necessary, to preserve adequate liquidity and ensure that our business can continue to operate during these uncertain times. Additionally, we operate in a rapidly evolving and unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or from credit facilities. Additional capital, if needed, may not be available on satisfactory terms, or at all. 
 Line of Credit 
 On August 1, 2023, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the "Loan Agreement") with Gibraltar Business Capital, LLC ("Lender"), to provide asset-based financing to the Company to be used for operating capital. Amounts available under the Loan Agreement (the "Revolving Loans") are subject to a borrowing base calculation of up to a maximum availability of 7,500,000 (the "Revolving Loan Commitment") and bear interest at SOFR plus 5.00 . The Company paid a closing fee of 1.00 of the Revolving Loan Commitment and the line is subject to a monthly unused line fee in an annualized amount equal to 0.50 on the difference between the Revolving Loan Commitment and the average outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans for such month. The maturity date is three years from the date of the promissory note evidencing the Revolving Loans, subject to extension in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement. 
 The Loan Agreement provides for revolving credit borrowings by the Company in an amount up to the lesser of the Revolving Loan Commitment and a borrowing base amount equal to the sum of stated percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory, less reserves, computed on a weekly basis. 
 The obligations of the Company under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company (including, without limitation, accounts receivable, equipment, inventory and other goods, intellectual property, contract rights and other general intangibles, cash, deposit accounts, equity interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures, investment property, documents and instruments, and proceeds of the foregoing). 
 The Loan Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or guarantee indebtedness, incur liens, dispose of assets, engage in mergers and consolidations, make acquisitions or other investments, make changes in the nature of its business, and engage in transactions with affiliates. The Loan Agreement also contains financial covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 if excess availability is less than 1,000,000 of the borrowing base. 
 Proposed 2023 Reverse Stock Split 
 On October 9, 2023, our board of directors unanimously approved and recommended that our shareholders (including holders of our Series A 8 Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock) approve at our annual meeting of shareholders the adoption of an amendment (the "Amendment") to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock (the "Proposed Reverse Stock Split") at any whole number between, and inclusive of, one-for-five to one-for-ten. On December 7, 2023, during the "2023 Annual Meeting" the shareholders approved a resolution granting the board of directors the authority, but not the obligation, to file the Amendment to effect the Proposed Reverse Stock Split at any time within one year from the date of shareholder approval, with the exact ratio and timing of the Proposed Reverse Stock Split to be determined at the discretion of the board of directors. For additional information about the 2023 Annual Meeting and the Proposed Reverse Stock Split, please see the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on October 24, 2023.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
 Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash position decreased 205,000 to 329,000 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 534,000 as of June 30, 2024. The primary uses of cash included 74,000 of principal payments on finance lease liabilities and 232,000 repaid on the line of credit. The primary source of cash for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 101,000 of cash provided by operating activities. 
 Trade Accounts Receivable, net 
 Trade accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, decreased approximately 389,000 or 11.3 , to 3,056,000 as of September 30, 2024, from 3,445,000 as of June 30, 2024. The decrease was driven primarily by a reduction in overall revenue and differences in the timing of collections around the end date of each respective quarter. Trade accounts receivable represents amounts due from our customers including dealers and distributors that purchase our products for redistribution, medical practitioners, clinics, hospitals, colleges, universities, and sports teams. We believe that our estimate of the allowance for credit losses is adequate based on our historical experience and relationships with our customers. Accounts receivable are generally collected within approximately 40 days of invoicing. 
 Inventories, net 
 Inventories, net of reserves, decreased 123,000 or 2.2 , to 5,471,000 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 5,594,000 as of June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to steps taken to adjust inventory management in response to the impact of the uncertain operating environment on the global supply chain and right-sizing incoming material purchases to match demand. We believe that our allowance for inventory obsolescence is adequate based on our analysis of inventory, sales trends, and historical experience. 
 Accounts Payable 
 Accounts payable increased approximately 27,000 or 1.0 , to 2,739,000 as of September 30, 2024, from 2,712,000 as of June 30, 2024. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in inventory purchases and timing of payments. 
 Line of Credit 
 The outstanding balance of the line of credit was 1,890,000 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 2,122,000 as of June 30, 2024. 
 Finance Lease Liability 
 Finance lease liability as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 totaled approximately 1,658,000 and 1,732,000, respectively. Our finance lease liability consists primarily of our Utah building lease. In conjunction with the sale and leaseback of our Utah building in August 2014, we entered into a 15-year lease, classified as a finance lease, originally valued at 3,800,000. The building lease asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 years at approximately 252,000 per year. Total accumulated amortization related to the leased building is approximately 2,561,000 at September 30, 2024. The sale generated a profit of 2,300,000, which is being recognized straight-line over the life of the lease at approximately 150,000 per year as an offset to amortization expense. The balance of the deferred gain as of September 30, 2024, is 740,000. Lease payments, currently approximately 33,000, are payable monthly and increase annually by approximately 2 per year over the life of the lease. Imputed interest for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 23,000. In addition to the Utah building, we have certain equipment leases that we have determined are finance leases. 
 Operating Lease Liability 
 Operating lease liability as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 totaled approximately 3,025,000 and 2,834,000, respectively. Our operating lease liability consists primarily of building leases for office, manufacturing, and warehouse space. 
 Deferred Income Tax Assets 
 A valuation allowance is required when there is significant uncertainty as to the realizability of deferred income tax assets. The ability to realize deferred income tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each tax jurisdiction. We have determined that we do not meet the "more likely than not" threshold that deferred income tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, a valuation allowance is required. Any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will favorably impact our results of operations in the period of reversal. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets. 
 Stock Repurchase Plans 
 We have a stock repurchase plan available to us at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Approximately 449,000 remained of this authorization as of September 30, 2024. No purchases have been made under this plan since September 2011. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in that report.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes from the information presented for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding any required disclosure. In designing and evaluating these disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at a reasonable assurance level, to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
