 Awards issued Awards vested ) Awards forfeited ) Awards outstanding September 30, 2024 Value of Stock Options and SARs The Company values options and SARs using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company lacks sufficient historical company-specific volatility information. Therefore, the Company estimates expected stock volatility based on historical volatility of peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. For options with service-based vesting conditions, the expected term of the Company s stock options has been determined utilizing the simplified method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla options. For SARs, the expected term is based upon the weighting of certain future events. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for the time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. An expected dividend yield of is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The assumptions used to value the awards are summarized in the following table. Expected volatility - - Risk-free interest rate - - Lack of marketability discount Expected term (years) - - Value of RSUs The fair value of RSUs is equal to the value of the Company s common stock on the grant date. The weighted average per share fair value of awards issued under the 2017 Plan and 2020 Plan was and on September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Company Overview We are a commercial-stage, pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for patients living with rare neurological diseases as well as patients living with other neurological diseases who have unmet medical needs. Our product, WAKIX (pitolisant), is a first-in-class molecule with a novel mechanism of action MOA specifically designed to increase histamine signaling in the brain by binding to H 3 receptors. In August 2019, WAKIX was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy, and its U.S. commercial launch was initiated in November 2019. In October 2020, WAKIX was approved by the FDA for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy. In June 2024, the FDA approved WAKIX for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in pediatric patients, six years and older, with narcolepsy. WAKIX is the first-and-only approved product for patients with narcolepsy that is not scheduled as a controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the DEA . Pitolisant was developed by Bioprojet and approved by the EMA in 2016 for the treatment of narcolepsy in adult patients with or without cataplexy and in 2021 for the treatment of EDS in adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea. We acquired an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize pitolisant in the United States pursuant to our license agreement with Bioprojet (as amended, the 2017 LCA in July 2017. Pitolisant was granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of narcolepsy by the FDA in 2010. It received Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy and Fast Track status for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy in April 2018 . We believe that pitolisant s ability to regulate histamine gives it the potential to provide therapeutic benefit in other rare neurological diseases that are mediated through H 3 receptors and histamine signaling. We have applied a mechanism-based approach to managing the life cycle of pitolisant and identified idiopathic hypersomnia IH ), another central disorder of hypersomnolence like narcolepsy, as our next potential new indication for WAKIX, which received orphan drug designation by the FDA in September 2023 and Fast Track Designation in November 2023. In April 2022, we initiated a Phase 3 registrational trial, the INTUNE Study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pitolisant in adult patients with IH. We completed enrollment in the INTUNE study in May 2023 and we announced topline data in October 2023. While the primary endpoint did not meet statistical significance, we believe the totality of the data showed favorable numerical trends for pitolisant in the treatment of adult patients with IH and we met with the FDA in March 2024 to discuss the path forward for IH. Following our meeting with the FDA, we plan to submit a supplemental NDA sNDA for IH in the fourth quarter of 2024 based on the totality of the data obtained from the INTUNE study and from other sources. We are focusing our development efforts on other rare neurological disorders in which EDS is a prominent symptom, including Prader-Willi Syndrome PWS and myotonic dystrophy type 1, otherwise known as dystrophia myotonica DM1 ). Based on the positive signals from the data from our Phase 2 proof-of-concept signal detection clinical trial to evaluate pitolisant for the treatment of EDS and other key behavioral symptoms in patients with PWS, an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA was held in June 2023. We aligned with the FDA on the proposed Phase 3 registration study design to support further investigation of pitolisant as a potential treatment to address the unmet medical need for children, adolescents and adults with PWS experiencing EDS, for which there is currently no approved treatment. In October 2023, we received FDA alignment regarding the study design for the Phase 3 TEMPO study in patients with PWS, which we believe will satisfy the requirements for both the registrational trial and one of the two requirements for pediatric exclusivity for pitolisant. In February 2024, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to pitolisant for the treatment of PWS. The Phase 3 registrational trial, the TEMPO study, was initiated in March 2024. In June 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 proof-of-concept signal detection clinical trial to evaluate pitolisant for the treatment of EDS, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in adult patients with DM1 and announced topline results from this trial in the fourth quarter of 2023, in which clinically meaningful improvements were demonstrated in EDS and fatigue. The safety profile was consistent with the established safety profile of pitolisant.

 Our partner, Bioprojet completed a Phase 3 trial in pediatric patients with narcolepsy and submitted the trial data to the European Medicines Agency (the EMA seeking approval for a pediatric narcolepsy indication. In January 2023, Bioprojet received a positive opinion from the EMA s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use CHMP and in March 2023, the EMA granted approval for the marketing authorization of WAKIX for the treatment of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in children six and older. Based on the data from the positive Phase 3 trial conducted by Bioprojet, we submitted an sNDA for pediatric narcolepsy in December 2023. On June 24, 2024, we announced that the FDA approved our sNDA for WAKIX for the treatment of EDS in pediatric patients six years of age and older with narcolepsy. We remain committed to obtaining pediatric exclusivity for WAKIX . The initiation of the PWS Phase 3 registrational trial, the TEMPO study, and the approval for EDS in pediatric narcolepsy are supportive of our efforts in obtaining pediatric exclusivity for WAKIX. We are expanding our pipeline through the acquisition of additional assets that focus on addressing the unmet needs of patients living with rare neurological diseases as well as patients living with other neurological diseases who have unmet medical needs. We are targeting assets that will allow us to further leverage the expertise and infrastructure that we have successfully built at Harmony so we can optimize the benefit of internal synergies. Consistent with this objective, in July 2022, we entered into a License and Commercialization Agreement (the 2022 LCA with Bioprojet whereby we obtained exclusive rights to manufacture, develop and commercialize one or more new products based on pitolisant in the United States and Latin America, with the potential to add additional indications and formulations upon the agreement of both parties. We have made progress in the development of two new formulations of pitolisant: Pitolisant GR and Pitolisant HD. Both formulations entered clinical studies in the fourth quarter of 2023 . We received data from the Pitolisant GR pilot bioequivalence study, which supports further development of Pitolisant GR. We are on-track to initiate a pivotal bioequivalence study and dosing optimization study in the first quarter of 2025. We received data from the Pitolisant HD pilot pharmacokinetics study in June 2024, which also supports advancing this development program toward pivotal trials. The formulation optimization and technical operations work is ongoing, with a goal to initiate Phase 3 registrational studies in the second half of 2025. A Phase 1b study was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Pitolisant HD and the initial results support advancement of the development program. Provisional patents have been filed for both of these formulations, with the potential for patent protection to the mid-2040 s. In October 2023, we completed the acquisition of Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Zynerba ), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on innovative pharmaceutically manufactured transdermal cannabidiol therapies for orphan neurobehavioral disorders. Zynerba s drug candidate is ZYN002, the first and only pharmaceutically manufactured synthetic cannabidiol gel, devoid of THC, and formulated as a patent protected, permeation-enhanced gel for transdermal delivery. Transdermal delivery is thought to provide better gastrointestinal tolerability and minimize the potential for drug interactions or impacts on liver function tests by avoiding first-pass metabolism in the liver. The most common adverse effect is application site pain, which studies have shown typically occurs in less than 7 of patients. ZYN002 is currently in a pivotal Phase 3 trial, the RECONNECT study, for the treatment of Fragile X Syndrome FXS ). In the Phase 2 CONNECT-FX trial, patients using ZYN002 showed 40 median improvement in social avoidance behavior as compared to the placebo. We believe the total addressable market for ZYN002 among patients with FXS is approximately 25,000 people based on an estimated current FXS prevalence of up to 87,000 cases and up to 40,000 diagnosed FXS cases. Patients with complete methylation demonstrate the most severe symptoms of FXS. Topline data from our ZYN002 Phase 3 study is anticipated in mid-2025. ZYN002 has patent protection for the treatment of FXS until 2038. Based on the positive proof-of-concept PoC study in 22q deletion syndrome, another rare disorder with prominent neurobehavioral symptoms, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 registrational study in 2025. In April 2024, we entered into a sublicense agreement with Bioprojet for an orexin-2 receptor agonist (OX2R) BP1.15205 to be evaluated for the treatment of narcolepsy and other potential indications (the Sublicense ). Under the Sublicense, we have obtained the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize BP1.15205 in the United States and Latin American territories, which are rights that Bioprojet

 originally licensed from Teijin Pharma, the innovator of BP1.15205. Pre-clinical data from BP1.15205 is promising and we plan to file an IND in mid-2025 and begin first-in-human studies in the second half of 2025. Additionally, in April 2024, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Epygenix Therapeutics, Inc. Epygenix ), pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement (the Epygenix Agreement ). As a result, we now have an exclusive license relating to the use of clemizole EPX100 ), initially for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome DS and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome LGS . Patients with both conditions often encounter severe refractory epilepsy, which is not controlled even with polypharmacy, and extreme co-morbidities or mortality without effective treatment. As such, there is a recognized need for improved treatment options for both conditions. We believe the total addressable market for EPX100 among patients with DS is approximately 5,000 people based on an estimated current DS prevalence of approximately 8,600 cases and approximately 7,000 diagnosed DS cases. We believe the total addressable market for EPX100 among patients with LGS is approximately 35,000 people based on an estimated current LGS prevalence of approximately 48,000 cases and 44,000 diagnosed LGS cases. EPX100 is currently in a Phase 3 registrational clinical trial for DS and we plan to initiate a Phase 3 registrational clinical trial in patients with LGS in the fourth quarter of 2024. In previous clinical trials, EPX100 has shown an improved safety and tolerability profile as compared to other approved therapies. We are currently developing EPX200, a potent, oral, centrally active and selective 5HT2C agonist and liquid formulation of lorcaserin EPX200 ), another asset acquired pursuant to the terms of the Epygenix Agreement. EPX200 is currently in IND-enabling studies to treat Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy. In August 2021, we acquired HBS-102, a Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor type 1 (MCHR1) antagonist previously developed as CSTI-100/ALB-127258(a)/ALB-127258 (the Compound ), along with intellectual property and other assets related to the development, manufacture, and commercialization of the Compound from ConSynance Therapeutics, Inc. We acquired full development and commercialization rights for HBS-102 globally, but we have provided an indication-limited grant-back license to ConSynance for the development and commercialization of the Compound in Greater China. We conducted a preclinical PoC study to assess the effect of HBS-102 on hyperphagia, weight gain and other metabolic parameters in a mouse model of PWS. The final report was received during the third quarter of 2024 and the results are consistent with the expected results . We are on track to initiate a juvenile toxicology study in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, a 13-week toxicology study is complete, and the preliminary results are encouraging. Our operations are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiaries, Harmony Biosciences, LLC and Zynerba, which is now known as Harmony Biosciences Management, Inc. as of July 1, 2024. Commercial Performance Metrics As of September 30, 2024, we continued to see growth in the number of unique healthcare professional HCP prescribers of WAKIX since it became available in November 2019. There are approximately 9,000 HCPs who treat patients living with narcolepsy, with approximately 4,000 enrolled in oxybate risk-evaluation and mitigation strategies. The average number of patients on WAKIX for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 6,800. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we have secured formulary access for more than 80 of all insured lives (Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid) in the United States. Financial Operations Overview Net Product Revenue Net product revenue includes gross product shipments less provisions for sales discounts and allowances, which includes trade allowances, rebates to government and commercial entities, and other discounts. Although we expect net sales to increase over time, provisions for sales discounts and allowances may fluctuate based on the mix of sales to different customer segments and/or changes in our estimates .

Table of Contents 
 Cost of Product Sales Cost of product sales includes manufacturing and distribution costs, the cost of API, FDA program fees, royalties due to third parties on net product sales, freight, shipping, handling, storage costs and salaries of employees involved with oversight of production. We expect the cost of product sales to increase as we continue to ramp up production in order to meet future demand for WAKIX and diversify our supply chain for WAKIX . The shelf life of WAKIX is four years from date of manufacture, with the earliest expiration of current inventory expected to be October 2025. We regularly review our inventory levels and expect write-offs from time to time. We will continue to assess inventory levels in future periods as demand for WAKIX and the rate of inventory turnover evolves. We currently have adequate supply of WAKIX to cover demand into the first quarter of 2026, with additional API on-hand inventory to support at least 24 months beyond this time frame . Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses primarily include development programs for potential new indications for pitolisant in patients with IH, PWS, DM1 and the development of ZYN002 in patients with FXS. We also incur research and development expenses related to our team of Medical Science Liaisons MSLs who interact with key opinion leaders, with a focus on the science, the role of histamine in sleep-wake state stability and the novel mechanism of action of pitolisant. In addition, our MSLs support our market access team with the presentation of clinical data to payors upon request and our clinical development team to identify potential clinical trial sites. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We have significantly increased our research and development efforts as we advance our clinical programs and add product candidates to expand our pipeline. Research and development expenses also include : employee -related expenses, such as salaries, share-based compensation, benefits and travel expenses for our research and development personnel ; direct third-party costs such as expenses incurred under agreements with clinical research organizations CROs ), and contract manufacturing organizations CMOs ; manufacturing costs in connection with producing materials for use in conducting clinical trials ; costs related to packaging and labelling of clinical supplies; other third-party expenses (e.g., consultants, advisors) directly attributable to the development of our product candidates; acquired in-process research and development; and amortization expense for assets used in research and development activities. 
 A significant portion of our research and development costs are external costs, such as fees paid to CROs and CMOs, central laboratories, contractors, and consultants in connection with our clinical development programs. Internal expenses primarily relate to personnel who are deployed across multiple programs . Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs in the current period than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials, milestone payments, and the cost of submitting an NDA to the FDA (and/or other regulatory authorities). We expect our research and development expenses to be significant as we advance our current clinical development programs and prepare to seek regulatory approval for additional

Table of Contents 
 indications for pitolisant, complete the Phase 3 clinical trials for ZYN002, EPX100 and advance the development of Pitolisant GR, Pitolisant HD, BP1.15205 and HBS-102 toward new indications . At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any additional indications for pitolisant or other product candidates that we move forward for regulatory approval. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including uncertainty related to : the duration, costs and timing of clinical trials of our current development programs and any further clinical trials related to new product candidates; the sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials; the acceptance of INDs for our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials; the successful and timely enrollment and completion of clinical trials; the successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials; successful data from our clinical programs that support an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates in the intended populations; the receipt and maintenance of regulatory and marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; establishing agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidate is approved; the entry into collaborations to further the development of our product candidates; obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; and successfully launching our product candidates and achieving commercial sales, if and when approved. 
 A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our programs or any product candidate we develop would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development and/or regulatory approval of such programs or product candidates. Sales and Marketing Expenses Our sales and marketing expenses primarily relate to the market development and commercialization activities of WAKIX for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy. Market development and commercial activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and are expensed as incurred. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in the near- and mid-term to support WAKIX s indications for the treatment of EDS or cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy, the treatment of EDS in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with narcolepsy and to expand our portfolio with the anticipated growth from potential additional indications .

Table of Contents 
 Sales and marketing expenses include: employee-related expenses, such as salaries, share-based compensation, benefits and travel expenses for our sales, marketing and market access personnel; healthcare professional-related expenses, including marketing programs, healthcare professional promotional medical education, disease education, conference exhibits and market research; patient-related expenses, including patient awareness and education programs, disease awareness education, patient reimbursement programs, patient support services and market research; market access expenses, including payor education, specialty pharmacy programs and services to support the continued commercialization of WAKIX; and secondary data purchases (i.e., patient claims and prescription data), data warehouse development and data management. 
 In addition, sales and marketing expenses include external costs such as website development, media placement fees, agency fees for patient, medical education and promotional expenses, market research, analysis of secondary data, conference fees and consulting fees. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, such as salaries, share-based compensation, benefits and travel expenses for our personnel in executive, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, investor relations, and other administrative departments. General and administrative expenses also consist of office leases, and professional fees, including legal, tax and accounting and consulting fees. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our continued commercialization efforts, ongoing and future potential research and development activities, and increased costs of operating as a public company. These increases will likely be driven by costs associated with the hiring of additional personnel and fees paid to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, we anticipate increased costs associated with being a public company, including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with the requirements of Nasdaq and the SEC, insurance and investor relations costs. If any of our current or future indication expansion programs or new product candidates obtain U.S. regulatory approval, we expect that we would incur significantly increased expenses associated with building a sales and marketing team. Paragon Agreement We are party to a right-of-use agreement with Paragon Biosciences, LLC Paragon whereby we have access to and the right to use certain office space leased by Paragon in Chicago, Illinois. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid fees of 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively, pursuant to this agreement. Interest Expense Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense on debt facilities, amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of premiums on our debt securities.

 Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of cash interest earned on our cash and investment balances and accretion of the discount on our investments in debt securities. Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected items in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In thousands) (In thousands) Net product revenue 186,038 160,268 513,467 413,610 Cost of product sales 42,778 32,296 102,406 78,084 Gross profit 143,260 127,972 411,061 335,526 Operating expenses: Research and development 25,387 17,499 111,159 45,757 Sales and marketing 27,576 23,418 83,316 70,518 General and administrative 28,587 22,546 81,487 67,417 Total operating expenses 81,550 63,463 275,962 183,692 Operating income 61,710 64,509 135,099 151,834 Loss on debt extinguishment (9,766) (9,766) Other (expense) income, net (124) (5) (228) (34) Interest expense (4,348) (7,012) (13,287) (18,961) Interest income 4,932 4,106 14,065 10,634 Net income before provision for income taxes 62,170 51,832 135,649 133,707 Income tax expense (16,077) (13,371) (39,631) (31,461) Net income 46,093 38,461 96,018 102,246 Net Product Revenue Net product revenue increased by 25.8 million, or 16.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased by 99.9 million, or 24.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to an 11.2 increase in the number of units shipped, and the impact of a 7 price increase partially offset by higher rebates and co-pay assistance, which resulted in a decrease in net product revenue of approximately 3 . The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a 19.5 increase in the number of units shipped, and the impact of a 7 price increase partially offset by higher rebates, which resulted in a decrease to net product revenue of approximately 4 . The price increase occurred in January 2024. Cost of Product Sales Cost of product sales increased by 10.5 million, or 32.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased by 24.3 million, or 31.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. Cost of product sales as a percentage of net product revenue was 23.0 and 19.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 20.2 and 18.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in cost of product sales and cost of product sales as a percentage of net revenue in both comparable periods was due to triggering a higher royalty tier under the 2017 LCA earlier in 2024 compared to 2023.

 Research and Development Expenses The following table is a summary of our research and development expenses: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) (in thousands) Pitolisant 7,483 10,459 (2,976) 23,868 25,434 (1,566) ZYN002 4,172 - 4,172 11,777 - 11,777 EPX100 2,069 - 2,069 2,069 - 2,069 IPR D 1,000 - 1,000 43,595 750 42,845 Personnel expenses 6,206 3,759 2,447 17,402 11,120 6,282 Stock-based compensation 1,910 1,030 880 4,964 2,962 2,002 Other research and development 2,547 2,251 296 7,484 5,491 1,993 Total 25,387 17,499 7,888 111,159 45,757 65,402 Research and development expenses increased by 7.9 million, or 45.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased by 65.4 million or 142.9 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a combined 6.2 million increase in research and development expenses for ZYN002 and EPX100, neither of which had any expenses in the prior year, a 2.5 million increase in personnel costs associated with higher headcount, a 1.0 million IPR D charge related to a preclinical milestone achieved for HBS-102 and a 0.9 million increase in stock compensation associated with new awards, partially offset by a 3.0 million decrease in clinical development work associated with pitolisant, driven by declines for IH, DM1 and PWS indications. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by 43.6 million in IPR D charges related to the Bioprojet Sublicense Agreement and the acquisition of Epygenix and a preclinical milestone achieved for HBS-102, a combined 13.9 million increase in research and development expenses for ZYN002 and EPX100, neither of which had any expenses in the prior year, a 6.3 million increase in personnel costs associated with higher headcount, and a 2.0 million increase in stock compensation associated with new awards, partially offset by a 1.6 million decrease in clinical development work associated with pitolisant, driven by decreases for the IH indication and a 0.8 million IPR D charge related to preclinical milestones achieved for HBS-102 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses increased by 4.2 million, or 17.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased by 12.8 million, or 18.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a 3.6 million increase in patient engagement and marketing activities and a 0.6 million increase in stock compensation associated with new awards. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a 8.4 million increase in patient engagement and marketing activities, a 1.9 million increase in personnel costs, and a 2.5 million increase in stock compensation associated with new awards. The increase in patient engagement and marketing activities for both comparable

 periods was driven by our continued growth of WAKIX and the increase in personnel costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to increased headcount. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased by 6.0 million, or 26.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased by 14.1 million, or 20.9 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a 4.0 million increase in legal and professional fees, primarily associated with patent lawsuits, a 2.0 million increase in stock compensation associated with new awards, and a 0.5 million increase in personnel costs. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a 7.5 million increase in legal and professional fees, primarily associated with patent lawsuits, a 6.1 million increase in stock compensation associated with new awards, and a 2.0 million increase in personnel costs, partially offset by a 1.3 million decrease in insurance and a 0.5 million decrease in travel expenses. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased by 2.7 million, or 38.0 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased by 5.7 million, or 29.9 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to lower interest rates as a result of refinancing into the TLA Credit Agreement (defined below). Interest Income Interest income increased by 0.8 million, or 20.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased by 3.4 million, or 32.2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily a result of having higher invested balances, and higher investment yields on those balances, compared to the prior year periods. Income Taxes Income tax expense was 16.1 million, representing a 25.9 effective tax rate, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.4 million, representing a 25.8 effective tax rate, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense was 39.6 million, representing a 29.2 effective tax rate, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 31.5 million, representing a 23.5 effective tax rate, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by the 17.1M IPR D charge related to the Epygenix acquisition, which was nondeductible for tax purposes. The effective tax rate of 25.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, included 5.1 in state income taxes, partially offset by a 0.9 benefit from credits. The effective tax rate of 29.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included 2.5 for nondeductible IPR D charges and 6.3 in state income taxes, partially offset by a 1.2 benefit from credits. Liquidity, Sources of Funding and Capital Resources Overview As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 504.7 million, outstanding debt of 185.0 million and an accumulated deficit of 47.3 million. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared as though we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

 We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments on hand as of September 30, 2024, will enable us to meet our operational liquidity needs and fund our potential investing activities for the next 12 months. We have based our liquidity and cash flow projections on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect. Term Loan A Credit Agreement In July 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the TLA Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent , and certain lenders. The TLA Credit Agreement provides for a five-year senior secured term loan (the TLA Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of 185.0 million. In September 2023, we entered into the First Incremental Amendment (the First Incremental Amendment with the Administrative Agent and Bank of America, N.A., as incremental lender. The First Incremental Amendment provides for an incremental senior secured term loan (the Incremental Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of 15.0 million. The First Incremental Amendment amends the TLA Credit Agreement and provides that the Incremental Term Loan will have identical terms as the TLA Term Loan. The repayment schedule for both the TLA Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan (together, the Term Loans consists of 3.8 million quarterly principal payments, which commence on December 31, 2023, increasing to 5.0 million quarterly principal payments beginning on December 31, 2025, with a 115.0 million payment due on the maturity date of July 26, 2028. The Term Loans bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at our option, (i) a base rate plus a specified margin ranging from 2.50 to 3.00 , based on our senior secured net leverage ratio (as defined in the TLA Credit Agreement) or (ii) Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 plus a specified margin ranging from 3.50 to 4.00 , based on our senior secured net leverage ratio. The TLA Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, financial covenants, representations and warranties, events of default and other provisions. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. Blackstone Credit Agreement In August 2021, we entered into the Blackstone Credit Agreement, which provided for (i) a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate original principal amount of 200.0 million (the Initial Term Loan and (ii) a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount up to 100.0 million (the DDTL ). The DDTL was initially available to draw down through August 9, 2022. In August 2022, we entered into an agreement to extend the expiration date of the DDTL to August 9, 2023, for which we would pay a ticking fee at a rate of 1 per annum on the undrawn portion of the DDTL (the Ticking Fee ), commencing on August 10, 2022. Net cash received from the Initial Term Loan was 191.8 million, net of debt issuance costs of 8.2 million. In addition, we paid 1.0 million in debt issuance costs relating to the DDTL, which was initially recorded in other current assets within the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. In connection with the TLA Credit Agreement, we extinguished the Blackstone Credit Agreement, which required a payoff amount of 207.3 million consisting of principal repayment, interest, exit fees, payment of the Ticking Fee and a prepayment premium. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 9.8 million relating to the Blackstone Credit Agreement within our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, we recognized 2.0 million relating to unamortized debt issuance costs relating to the DDTL and the Ticking Fee, which was recorded in interest expense, net within the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The Common CVR Amounts are to be paid in cash, subject to any applicable withholding of taxes and without interest. The aggregate consideration we paid to acquire the Zynerba Common Stock upon completion of the Tender Offer was 60.0 million, exclusive of transaction-related fees. We financed the acquisition with cash on hand. On July 1, 2024, we announced the change of the name of our wholly owned subsidiary from Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to Harmony Biosciences Management, Inc. As of July 1, 2024, Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is now known as Harmony Biosciences Management, Inc. Epygenix Acquisition In April 2024, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Epygenix, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement. In connection with the closing of the transaction, we paid the former stockholders of Epygenix up front consideration of 35.0 million less a working capital adjustment. In addition, we will also be obligated to pay up to 130.0 million upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and up to 515.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales-based milestones, in each case to Epygenix s former stockholders. As a result, the Company now has an exclusive license relating to the use of clemizole, initially for the treatment of DS and LGS . ConSynance Agreement In August 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with ConSynance Therapeutics, Inc.

In March 2023, we achieved a preclinical milestone, which triggered a 0.8 million payment under the provisions of the APA, which we recognized as an IPR D charge recorded in research and development within the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In September 2024, we achieved a milestone for preclinical proof-of concept, which triggered a 1.0 million payment under the provisions of the APA, which we recognized as an IPR D charge recorded in research and development within the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. There are additional payments due upon the achievement of certain milestones, including 19.0 million for development milestones, 44.0 million for regulatory milestones and 110.0 million for sales milestones.

 Bioprojet Agreements In April 2024, we entered into a sublicense agreement with Bioprojet for an orexin-2 receptor agonist (OX2R) (the Licensed Compound to be evaluated for the treatment of narcolepsy and other potential indications (the Sublicense ). Under the Sublicense, the Company obtained the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Licensed Compound in the United States and Latin American territories (the Licensed Territories ), which are rights that Bioprojet originally licensed from Teijin Pharma, the innovator of the Licensed Compound. The Licensed Compound is currently in pre-clinical development with a Clinical Trial Application currently anticipated in mid-2025. Under the Sublicense, the Company paid Bioprojet an upfront license fee of 25.5 million and will also be obligated to pay up to 127.5 million upon achievement of development and regulatory milestones and up to 240.0 million upon achievement of sales-based milestones, as well as royalty rates in the mid-teens on potential sales in the Licensed Territories. In July 2022, we entered into the 2022 LCA with Bioprojet whereby we obtained exclusive rights to manufacture, develop and commercialize one or more new products based on pitolisant in the United States and Latin America, with the potential to add additional indications and formulations upon the agreement of both parties. We paid an initial, non-refundable 30.0 million licensing fee in October 2022 and additional payments of up to 155.0 million are potentially due under the 2022 LCA upon the achievement of certain future development and sales-based milestones. In addition, certain payments will become due upon the achievement of development milestones for new indications and formulations as agreed upon by both parties. The 2022 LCA also includes a fixed trademark royalty and a tiered royalty based on net sales of any new products commercialized, which will be payable to Bioprojet on a quarterly basis. Recent Milestones In September 2024, we achieved a preclinical milestone that triggered a 1.0 million payment under the provisions of the APA, which is unpaid and recorded in accrued expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Selected cash flow data (In thousands) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 144,259 142,722 Investing activities (60,297) (10,374) Financing activities (8,255) (52,029) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisted of net income of 96.0 million adjusted for non-cash items of 42.6 million related to acquired IPR D, 32.9 million related to stock-based compensation expense, and 18.1 million related to intangible amortization and depreciation, offset by 22.6 million related to deferred tax assets. Net working capital excluding cash increased by 23.1 million, primarily driven by increases in accounts receivable due to higher net product revenue in the current period and decreases in accounts payable due to the timing of payments. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisted of net income of 102.2 million adjusted for non-cash items of 14.5 million related to deferred tax assets, 18.2 million related to intangible amortization and depreciation, 22.3 million related to stock-based compensation

Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 60.3 million, which was primarily attributable to 69.6 million in purchases of debt securities, a 25.5 million license fee paid to Bioprojet, 33.1 million net cash consideration paid for the acquisition of Epygenix, and 0.6 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by 68.5 million from maturities of investments. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 10.4 million, which was primarily attributable to 105.9 million in purchases of debt securities, partially offset by 95.7 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and 0.2 million in purchases of property and equipment . Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 8.3 million, which primarily consisted of 11.3 million in principal payments associated with the TLA Credit Agreement, partially offset by 3.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and 0.3 million of employee withholding tax payments related to stock-based awards.

Critical Accounting Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis . Significant estimates include assumptions used in the determination of the amount of revenue recognized on sales of WAKIX, costs incurred under services type agreements related to the performance of research and development activities, the measurement of compensation expense pursuant to stock-based awards, the calculation of our income tax provision, and the determination of accounting treatment for our business combinations. We base our estimates on contractual terms, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . We define our critical accounting policies as those under GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. During the quarter covered by this report, there were no material changes to the accounting policies and assumptions previously disclosed, except as disclosed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Fluctuation Risk We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We invest a portion of our cash in investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, maintain liquidity and maximize total return. In order to achieve these objectives, we invest in money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper in accordance with our investment policy. Our investment policy defines allowable investments and establishes guidelines relating to credit quality, diversification, and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. All investment securities have a credit rating of at least A-2/P-2/F2 from at least two National Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations. We do not have any direct investments in asset-backed securities, collateralized debt or loan obligations, or structured investment vehicles. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. Based on our 413.7 million of investments in money market funds, U.S. treasury notes, corporate bonds and municipal obligations as of September 30, 2024, an immediate 10 change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of our investment portfolio or on our financial position or results of operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had 185.0 million in borrowings outstanding. The Term Loans bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at our option, (i) a base rate plus a specified margin ranging from 2.50 to 3.00 , based on our senior secured net leverage ratio (as defined in the TLA Credit Agreement) or (ii) Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 plus a specified margin ranging from 3.50 to 4.00 , based on our senior secured net leverage ratio. Based on the 185.0 million of principal outstanding as of September 30, 2024, an immediate 10 change in the SOFR would not have a material impact on our debt-related obligations, financial position or results of operations. Foreign Currency Fluctuation Risk We are not currently exposed to significant market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; however, we have contracted with and may continue to contract with foreign vendors that are located in Europe. Our operations may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future. Inflation Fluctuation Risk Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, 

 41 

Table of Contents 
 summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings . From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Our management believes that there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Refer to Part I, Item I, Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies, of this Quarterly Report for a full description of our material pending legal matters. Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition to the other information included in this report, you should carefully consider the discussion of risk factors affecting the Company as set forth in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in these reports are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. None. Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities. None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable.
