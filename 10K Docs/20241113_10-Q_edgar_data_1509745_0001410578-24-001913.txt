 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INDUSTRY DATA This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, our operations and financial performance. Such statements are based upon our current plans, estimates and expectations that are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. The inclusion of forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation that such plans, estimates and expectations will be achieved. Words such as anticipate, expect, project, intend, believe, may, will, should, plan, could, continue, target, contemplate, estimate, forecast, guidance, predict, possible, potential, pursue, likely, and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future plans, actions or events identify forward-looking statements. All statements, other than historical facts, including statements regarding estimations of projected cash runway; our future product development plans; the potential, safety, efficacy, and regulatory and clinical progress of our product candidates, including the anticipated timing for initiation of clinical trials and release of clinical trial data and the expectations surrounding potential regulatory submissions, approvals and timing thereof; and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing, are forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our plans, estimates or expectations could include, but are not limited to: (i) our ability and plan to develop and commercialize DKN-01 and our other programs; (ii) status, timing and results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials; (iii) the potential benefits of DKN-01 and our other programs; (iv) the timing of our development programs and seeking regulatory approval of DKN-01 and our other programs; (v) our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval; (vi) our estimates of expenses and future revenues and profitability; (vii) our estimates regarding our capital requirements and our needs for additional financing; (viii) our estimates of the size of the potential markets for DKN-01 and our other programs; (ix) the benefits to be derived from any collaborations, license agreements, or other acquisition efforts, including the ongoing collaborations with BeiGene, NovaRock and Adimab; (x) sources of revenues and anticipated revenues, including contributions from any collaborations or license agreements for the development and commercialization of products; (xi) the rate and degree of market acceptance of DKN-01 or our other products; (xii) the success of other competing therapies that may become available; (xiii) the manufacturing capacity for our products; (xiv) our intellectual property position; (xv) our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights; (xvi) our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, and growth and strategies; (xvii) the industry in which we operate; (xviii) the trends that may affect the industry or us and (xix) the effect of inflation, currency rate and interest rate fluctuations, as well as fluctuations in the market price of our traded securities. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events, competitive dynamics and industry change, and depend on economic circumstances that may or may not occur in the future or may occur on longer or shorter timelines than anticipated. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and events in the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report, they may not be predictive of results or developments in future periods. You should carefully and completely read this Quarterly Report and any documents that we have filed as exhibits to this Quarterly Report.

 . Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit of as of September 30, 2024, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of . The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents of as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses for at least the next 12 months from issuance of these financial statements. In addition, to support its future operations, the Company will likely seek additional funding through public or private equity financings or government programs and will seek funding or development program cost-sharing through collaboration agreements or licenses with larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. If the Company does not obtain additional funding or development program cost-sharing, or exceeds its current spending forecasts or fails to receive the research and development tax incentive payment, the Company has the ability and would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate certain clinical trials or research and development programs, reduce or eliminate discretionary operating expenses, and delay company and pipeline expansion, any of which could adversely affect its business prospects. The inability to obtain funding, as and when needed, could have a negative impact on the Company s financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategies.

 to as a result of a down round, the Company recorded a dividend of during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company initially classified the warrants that were exercisable for shares for Series X Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock (the January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants as a liability on its condensed consolidated balance sheet on January 17, 2023 and subsequently remeasured the warrant liability to fair value at each reporting date until the conversion of Series X Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series X Preferred Stock into common stock, which occurred on June 21, 2023. Changes in the fair value of the warrant liability were recognized as gains (losses) in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations. In June 2023, in connection with obtaining Stockholder Approval to convert shares of Series X Preferred Stock into shares of common stock Stockholder Approval ), the January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants were reclassified from liability to equity.

 was reasonable to use as the incremental borrowing rate for purposes of the calculation of lease liabilities. In accordance with the guidance in Topic 842, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components (e.g., land, building, etc.), non-lease components (e.g., common area maintenance, maintenance, consumables, etc.), and non-components (e.g., property taxes, insurance, etc.). Then the fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any related to non-components) must be allocated based on fair values to the lease components and non-lease components. Although separation of lease and non-lease components is required, certain practical expedients are available. Entities may elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. Rather, they would account for each lease component and the related non-lease component together as a single component. The Company has elected to account for the lease and non-lease components of each of its operating leases as a single lease component and allocate all of the contract consideration to the lease component only. The lease component results in an operating right-of-use asset being recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized such that lease expense is recorded on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.

 of the outstanding equity of Flame, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the Effective Date (the Merger Agreement ), by and among Leap, Fire Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Leap First Merger Sub ), Flame Biosciences LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Leap Second Merger Sub ), Flame, and the Stockholder Representative named therein. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, First Merger Sub merged with and into Flame, and Flame was the surviving corporation of such merger and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Leap (the First Merger ). Immediately following the First Merger, Flame merged with and into Second Merger Sub, and Second Merger Sub was the surviving entity of such merger (together with the First Merger, the Merger ). Pursuant to the Merger, Leap agreed to issue to the stockholders of Flame (the Flame Stockholders shares of common stock, and shares of Series X Preferred Stock, which was a newly designated series of preferred stock that was intended to have economic rights equivalent to the common stock, but with limited voting rights, and issued to the warrant holders of Flame (the Flame Warrant Holders the right to acquire shares of common stock (the January 2023 Common Stock Warrants and shares of Series X Preferred Stock (the January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants ). Each share of Series X Preferred Stock converted into shares of common stock during the three months ended June 30, 2023, as a result of the one -for-ten reverse stock split approved by the stockholders and effected by the Board of Directors. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Leap held back approximately Series X Preferred shares (the Holdback Shares ), which converted into shares of common stock out of the aggregate number of shares that the Flame Stockholders otherwise would be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger so that Leap can have recourse to the Holdback Shares for purposes of satisfying certain claims for indemnification that Leap may have against the Flame Stockholders in connection with the Merger. In January 2024, Leap released the Holdback Shares to the Flame Shareholders. On June 16, 2023, the Company obtained Stockholder Approval to convert the Series X Preferred Stock into shares of its common stock, which occurred on June 21, 2023. The Company accounted for the acquisition of Flame as an asset acquisition allocating the purchase price under GAAP of to net assets acquired. Although there is a presumption under SEC Rule 11-01(d) 11-01(d) that when a legal entity is acquired, it represents a business acquisition, the Company concluded that, in this case, the transaction did not represent the acquisition of a business. After considering the criteria set forth in 11-01(d), the Company concluded that the acquisition of Flame by the Company was an acquisition of assets and not an acquisition of a business in accordance with 11-01(d). Specifically, the Company concluded that 1) the entity did not generate revenue and 2) there was not sufficient continuity of Flame s operations prior to and following the transaction, in that no facilities, employees, sales force, distribution system, customer base, trade names or production techniques remained with the entity after the acquisition. Leap primarily acquired cash of , certain working capital items and a portfolio of clinical- and pre-clinical-stage intellectual property, in connection with the acquisition of Flame. The Company accounted for the acquisition of Flame by recording the cash and any other assets and liabilities of Flame on its condensed consolidated balance sheet at their historical carrying values, which approximates fair values. The remaining fair value of the consideration transferred was allocated to the in-process research and development IPR D assets acquired. Certain transaction costs that were not deemed to meet the criteria of costs directly attributable to the issuance of securities were capitalized in accordance with ASC 805-50-30-1 and recognized as part of the fair value of assets acquired. As the Company concluded that such IPR D does not have an alternative future use, the relative fair value allocated to acquired IPR D of was expensed in research and development expenses within the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Company may also (i) pay Contingent Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that may become payable if, and only if, certain assets of Flame related to Flame s FL-101 program and/or FL-103 program are sold after the consummation of the Merger pursuant to the FL-101/103 Disposition Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement), which Contingent Merger Consideration shall be of the after-tax net proceeds of such sale, if any, and the payment thereof is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and (ii) issue pursuant to the Merger additional shares of Series X Preferred Stock or common stock as a result of any applicable post-closing purchase price adjustment in the event that Flame s actual Company Net Cash (as defined in the Merger Agreement) as of the Effective Date is determined to be greater than Flame s estimated Company Net Cash as of the closing.

 . Pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement, the Company is entitled to receive milestone payments of up to upon achievement of certain regulatory approval and sales milestones specified in the asset purchase agreement. The IPR D assets sold related to Flame s FL - 101/FL - 103 program did not meet the definition of a business and had a carrying value of at the time of the sale. In addition, the Company estimated the likelihood of receiving any milestone payments to be remote. As such, management elected the most likely amount method to determine the transaction price of the sale, which included the non - refundable closing date cash payment of and future milestone payments of . Therefore, the Company recognized a non - operating gain in other income for the difference between the amount of non - refundable consideration received of and the carrying value of during the year ended December 31, 2023. In the event of a change in circumstances, such that it becomes likely that the Company will receive milestone payments, the Company will recognize income for the change in transaction price in the period in which the transaction price changes. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred various qualified expenses, such as legal fees, consulting and general and administrative expenses in connection with the sale of Flame s FL - 101 program. Such expenses exceeded the non - refundable consideration received of , and therefore, the Company was not obligated to pay Contingent Merger Consideration to the Flame Stockholders. Series X Preferred Stock Pursuant to the Merger, the Company agreed to issue shares of Series X Preferred Stock to Flame Stockholders and January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants for shares of Series X Preferred Stock to Flame Warrant Holders. The Company obtained Stockholder Approval during the three months ended June 30, 2023 to convert each issued share of Series X Preferred Stock and each share of Series X Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to the January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants into shares of its common stock. The Series X Preferred Stock was converted to common stock on June 21, 2023. January 2023 Common Stock Warrants and January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants In January 2023, pursuant to the Merger, the warrants held by the Flame Warrant Holders became exercisable for shares of Leap s common stock (the January 2023 Common Stock Warrants ). The January 2023 Common Stock Warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire in February 2025. The January 2023 Common Stock Warrants qualify for equity classification. Also in January 2023, pursuant to the Merger, the warrants held by the Flame Warrant Holders became exercisable for shares of Series X Preferred Stock (the January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants ). Upon obtaining Stockholder Approval for the conversion of the Series X Preferred Stock and the one -for-ten reverse stock split, each share of Series X Preferred Stock converted into shares of Common Stock. The January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire in February 2025. The Company initially recorded the January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants as a liability on the Effective Date and the warrant liability was subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date and on the date on which Stockholder Approval to convert shares of Series X Preferred Stock into shares of common stock was obtained. On June 21, 2023, after obtaining stockholder approval for the conversion of the Series X Preferred Stock into common stock, the January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants were reclassified from liability to equity. Changes in the fair value of the warrant liability are recognized as gains (losses) in the Company s consolidated statement of operations. During the nine months ended September, 2023, the Company recorded a gain of in its condensed consolidated statement of operations.

This value is measured as the difference between (1) the financial instrument s fair value (without the down round feature) using the pre-trigger exercise price and (2) the financial instrument s fair value (with the down round feature) using the reduced exercise price. The value of the effect of the down round feature will be treated as a dividend and a reduction to income available to common stockholders in the basic EPS calculation. In connection with the April 2024 Private Placement, when the 2017 Warrants were repriced from to , the Company recorded a dividend of during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 2019 Warrants During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company redeemed of the 2019 Warrants at a purchase price of per share. January 2023 Common Stock Warrants In January 2023, pursuant to the Merger, the warrants held by the Flame Warrant Holders became exercisable for shares of Leap s common stock (the January 2023 Common Stock Warrants ). The January 2023 Common Stock Warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire in February 2025. The January 2023 Common Stock Warrants qualify for equity classification. January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants In January 2023, pursuant to the Merger, the warrants held by the Flame Warrant Holders also became exercisable for shares of Series X Preferred Stock (the January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants ). Following Stockholder Approval, each share of Series X Preferred Stock converted into shares of common stock during the three months ended June 30, 2023. The January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire in February 2025. The Company initially recorded the January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants as a liability on its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the Effective Date and subsequently remeasured the warrant liability to fair value at each reporting date and on the date Stockholder Approval was obtained to convert shares of Series X Preferred Stock into shares of common stock. Changes in the fair value of the warrant liability were recognized as gains (losses) in the Company s consolidated statement of operations. During the nine months ended September, 2023, the Company recorded a gain of in its condensed consolidated statement of operations. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, upon obtaining Stockholder Approval, the January 2023 Series X Preferred Stock Warrants were converted into common stock warrants and reclassified from liability to equity.

Private Placement - April 2024 On April 15, 2024, the Company completed a private placement whereby the Company issued shares of its common stock at a purchase price of per share, and prefunded warrants at a purchase price of per share (which is equal to the price per share less the exercise price per warrant share). The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the offering was , net of of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company. of the Company s outstanding common stock as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year or such lesser amount as determined by the compensation committee of the Company s Board of Directors. On June 16, 2022, the Company s stockholders approved the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2022 Plan ), which provides for a total of new shares of the Company s common stock to be granted. In addition, on June 16, 2023, and July 2, 2024, stockholders approved new shares of the Company s common stock to be added to the 2022 Plan for future issuance of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares available for grant under the Company s equity incentive plans. A summary of stock option activity under the Equity Plans is as follows: Granted Exercised ) Forfeited ) Outstanding at September 30, 2024 Options exercisable at September 30, 2024 Options vested and expected to vest at September 30, 2024 The grant date fair value of the options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The expected life was estimated using the simplified method as defined by the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin 107, Share-Based Payment. The expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company. The risk-free interest rate was based on the continuous rates provided by the U.S. Treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the option.

The assumptions that the Company used to determine the grant-date fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows, presented on a weighted average basis: Weighted average risk-free interest rate Expected dividend yield Expected term (in years) Stock options generally vest over a three or period, as determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant. The options expire from the grant date. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of approximately years. Restricted Stock Units RSUs The Company did not grant any RSUs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following table presents RSU activity under the 2016 Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: Vested ) Forfeited ) Outstanding at September 30, 2024 As of September 30, 2024, there were shares outstanding covered by RSUs that are expected to vest with a weighted average grant date fair value of per share and an aggregate grant date fair value of approximately . As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately of unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted to employees, which are expected to be recognized as expense over a remaining weighted average period of years.

All warrants exercisable for common stock participate on a one-for-one basis and shares and warrants exercisable for Series X Preferred Stock issued participate on an as converted basis with common stock in the distribution of dividends, if and when declared by the board of directors, on the Company s common stock. For purposes of computing EPS, these securities are considered to participate with common stock in earnings of the Company. Therefore, the Company calculates basic and diluted EPS using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net income for the period is allocated between common stockholders and participating securities according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. No income was allocated to the warrants and Series X Preferred Stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as results of operations were a loss for the period. The Company s potentially dilutive securities include RSUs, stock options and warrants. These securities were excluded from the computations of diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as the effect would be to reduce the net loss per share. The following table includes the potential shares of common stock, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, that were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect: Options to purchase common stock Warrants to purchase common stock noncancelable commitments under these agreements.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and other disclosures included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the disclosures under Part II, Item IA Risk Factors, and our audited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on March 18, 2024. Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, unless otherwise indicated, amounts are presented in U.S. dollars. Company Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company developing biomarker-targeted antibody therapies designed to treat patients with cancer by inhibiting fundamental tumor-promoting pathways, targeting cancer-specific cell surface molecules, and harnessing the immune system to attack cancer cells. Our strategy is to identify, acquire, and develop molecules that will rapidly translate into high impact therapeutics that generate durable clinical benefit and enhanced patient outcomes. Our lead clinical stage program is DKN-01, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits Dickkopf-related protein 1, or DKK1. We are currently studying DKN-01 in multiple ongoing clinical trials in patients with esophagogastric cancer, gynecologic cancers, or colorectal cancer. We also have two other antibody programs, FL-301 and FL-501. We intend to apply our extensive experience in identifying and developing transformational products to build a pipeline of programs that have the potential to change the practice of cancer medicine. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to development efforts relating to our product candidates, including manufacturing and conducting clinical trials of our product candidates, providing general and administrative support for these operations and protecting our intellectual property. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from our sales of common stock and preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of notes payable. Recent Developments Since June 30, 2024, we have continued to make progress with the development of DKN-01 and our business strategy. DKN-01 Development Update Enrollment completed in the expanded randomized controlled Part B of the DeFianCe study evaluating DKN-01 in combination with standard of care bevacizumab and chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced colorectal cancer CRC ). Part B of the DeFianCe study is a Phase 2, randomized, controlled, open-label study of DKN-01 in combination with standard of care bevacizumab and chemotherapy in patients with advanced CRC who have received one prior systemic therapy. Part B of the study enrolled 188 patients. We expect to report initial data in mid-2025. Patient follow-up continuing in the randomized controlled Part C of the DisTinGuish study evaluating DKN-01 in combination with tislelizumab and chemotherapy in patients with gastroesophageal junction GEJ and gastric cancer, with initial data expected in late 2024 or early 2025. Part C of the DisTinGuish study is a Phase 2, randomized, controlled, open-label study of DKN-01 in combination with tislelizumab and chemotherapy in first-line, HER-2 negative patients with GEJ and gastric cancer. Part C of the study enrolled 170 patients. We expect to report initial data in late 2024 or early 2025.

 Pipeline Update: Advancing FL-501 into development as a potential best-in-class anti-GDF-15 antibody with promising preclinical data. FL-501 is a potential best in class monoclonal antibody designed to neutralize GDF-15 to treat patients with cachexia and other GDF-15-driven diseases. FL-501 may also enhance the activity of the immune system in the tumor micro-environment. FL-501 was engineered for higher target affinity and a longer plasma half-life compared to competing therapies. In preclinical cachexia models, FL-501 increased body weight and restored muscle mass. 
 Financial Overview Research and Development Expenses Our research and development activities have included conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings for our product candidates, primarily DKN-01. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of: salaries and related overhead expenses for personnel in research and development functions, including costs related to stock-based compensation; fees paid to consultants and CROs for our nonclinical and clinical trials, and other related clinical trial fees, including but not limited to laboratory work, clinical trial database management, clinical trial material management and statistical compilation and analysis; costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial material; and costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements. 
 We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of DKN-01 and any other product candidates, subject to the availability of additional funding. Our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of internal and external costs, such as employee costs, including salaries and stock-based compensation, other internal costs, fees paid to consultants, central laboratories, contractors and CROs in connection with our clinical and preclinical trial development activities. We use internal resources to manage our clinical and preclinical trial development activities and perform data analysis for such activities. We participate, through our subsidiary in Australia, in the Australian government s research and development R D Incentive program R D Incentive Program ), such that a percentage of our eligible research and development expenses are reimbursed by the Australian government as a refundable tax offset and such incentives are reflected as other income.

 The table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred by development program and the R D Incentive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of any of our product candidates or the period, if any, in which material net cash inflows from these product candidates may commence. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of: the scope, rate of progress and expense of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical trials and other research and development activities; future clinical trial results; and the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals. 
 A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could result in a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, accounting and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company. Interest income Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents.

 Research and development incentive income Research and development incentive income includes payments under the R D Incentive Program from the government of Australia. The R D Incentive Program is one of the key elements of the Australian government s support for Australia s innovation system. It was developed to assist businesses in recovering some of the costs of undertaking research and development. The research and development tax incentive provides a tax offset to eligible companies that engage in research and development activities. Companies engaged in research and development may be eligible for either: a refundable tax offset at a rate of 18.5 above the company s tax rate for entities with income of less than A 20 million per annum; or a non-refundable tax offset for all other entities which is a progressive marginal tiered R D intensity threshold. Increasing rates of benefit apply for incremental research and development expenditure by intensity: 0 to 2 intensity: an 8.5 premium to the company s tax rate Greater than 2 intensity: a 16.5 premium to the company s tax rate; 
 We recognize as income the amount we expect to be reimbursed for qualified expenses. Foreign currency translation adjustment Foreign currency translation adjustment consists of gains (losses) due to the revaluation of foreign currency transactions attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with our Australian subsidiary. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 18, 2024, and the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe that of our critical accounting policies, the following accounting policies involve the most judgment and complexity: accrued research and development expenses; research and development incentive receivable; and stock-based compensation.

The increase of 3.4 million in research and development expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to an increase of 1.7 million in manufacturing costs related to clinical trial material and manufacturing campaigns, and an increase of 0.8 million in clinical trial costs due to patient enrollment, the duration of patients on study, the enhancement of correlative studies, the increase in site activity associated with Part C of the DisTinGuish study, and the expansion of the size of Part B of the DeFianCe study. There was also an increase of 0.5 million in consulting fees associated with research and development activities and an increase of 0.4 million in payroll and other related expenses due to an increase in headcount of our R D full-time employees. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses were 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.4 million in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, was due to a 0.4 million decrease in professional fees.

 Interest Income During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded interest income of 0.9 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded interest income of 1.1 million. The decrease was due to a higher average cash and cash equivalent balance during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Australian Research and Development Incentives We recorded R D incentive income of 0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, based upon the applicable percentage of eligible research and development activities under the R D Incentive Program, which expenses included the cost of manufacturing clinical trial material. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we expensed 0.5 million of R D incentive income recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2024, in connection with our estimated 2024 Australian tax liability. The R D incentive receivable has been recorded as Research and development incentive receivable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Foreign Currency Gain/Loss During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded foreign currency transaction losses of 0.5 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an immaterial amount of foreign currency transaction losses. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are due to changes in the Australian dollar exchange rate related to activities of the Australian entity. Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

The decrease of 17.5 million in research and development expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to 29.6 million of in-process research and development IPR D acquired in the Flame merger which we expensed during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of 8.7 million in clinical trial costs due to patient enrollment, the duration of patients on study, the enhancement of correlative studies, the increase in site activity associated with Part C of the DisTinGuish study, and the expansion of the size of Part B of the DeFianCe study. There was also an increase of 1.9 million in manufacturing costs related to clinical trial material and manufacturing campaigns, an increase of 1.5 million in payroll and other related expenses due to an increase in headcount of our R D full-time employees and an increase of 0.1 million in consulting fees associated with research and development activities. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses were 9.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.9 million in general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, was due to a decrease of 1.2 million in professional fees associated with our business development activities, partially offset by an increase of 0.3 million in payroll and other related expenses. Interest Income During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded interest income of 2.5 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded interest income of 3.1 million. The decrease was due to a higher average cash and cash equivalent balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Australian Research and Development Incentives We recorded R D incentive income of 1.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, based upon the applicable percentage of eligible research and development activities under the R D Incentive Program, which expenses included the cost of manufacturing clinical trial material. We did not record R D incentive income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The R D incentive receivable has been recorded as Research and development incentive receivable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Foreign Currency Loss During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded foreign currency transaction losses of 1.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an immaterial amount of foreign currency transaction losses. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are due to changes in the Australian dollar exchange rate related to activities of the Australian entity.

 Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Since our inception, we have been engaged in organizational activities, including raising capital, and research and development activities. We do not yet have a product that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ), have not yet achieved profitable operations, nor have we ever generated positive cash flows from operations. There is no assurance that profitable operations, if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis. Further, our future operations are dependent on the success of efforts to raise additional capital, our research and commercialization efforts, regulatory approval, and, ultimately, the market acceptance of our products. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 205-40, Going Concern, we have evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 62.8 million. Additionally, we had an accumulated deficit of 451.9 million at September 30, 2024, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 52.4 million. We expect to continue to generate operating losses in the foreseeable future. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents of 62.8 million as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of this report on Form 10-Q. In addition, to support our future operations, we will seek additional funding through public or private equity financings or government programs and will seek funding or development program cost-sharing through collaboration agreements or licenses with larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. If we do not obtain additional funding or development program cost-sharing, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate certain clinical trials or research and development programs, reduce or eliminate discretionary operating expenses, and delay company and pipeline expansion, which could adversely affect our business prospects. The inability to obtain funding, as and when needed, could have a negative impact on Leap s financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Cash used in operating activities (44,787) (33,373) Cash provided by investing activities 48,969 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 37,080 (30) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (113) (323) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (7,820) 15,243 Operating activities . Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to our net loss from the operation of our business of 52.1 million and net changes in working capital, including a decrease in lease liabilities of 0.3 million. These changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 2.6 million, an increase in taxes payable of 0.7 million, a decrease of 0.3 million in right-of-use asset, a decrease of 0.1 million in other assets and noncash stock-based compensation expense of 4.0 million. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to our net loss from the operation of our business of 68.9 million and net changes in working capital, including a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 1.0 million and a decrease in lease liabilities of 0.3 million.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Not Applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is also serving as Chief Financial Officer and therefore currently serves as both our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who is also serving as Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded, based upon the evaluation described above, that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, internal control over financial reporting.
