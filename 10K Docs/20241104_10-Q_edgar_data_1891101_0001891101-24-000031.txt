on purchases. Non-subscription customers earn on purchases. Any customer who spends or more annually can also earn on purchases, after the spending criteria is met. In addition to earning points on purchases, customers can earn points through certain other activities. BRCC reserves the right in its sole discretion to modify, change, add, or remove activities which can be accomplished to earn points at any time. Under the Loyalty Program, customers may redeem rewards as they reach minimum thresholds per reward. The Company reserves the right to modify, change, add, or remove rewards and their points thresholds at any time. Conversion of rewards are non-changeable after redemption, have no cash value, and are non-transferable. A portion of rewards are expected to expire and not be redeemed and will be recognized as income over time. Based on historical expiration rates, the Company estimates a certain percentage of rewards to expire and reassesses this estimate on a quarterly basis. 
 
 The Company defers revenue associated with the points earned through purchases that are expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed loyalty points. When a customer redeems an earned reward, the Company recognizes revenue for the redeemed product and reduces the related deferred revenue liability. The deferred revenue liability is included in "Deferred revenue and gift card liability" on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. Until March 2024, BRCC loyalty points expired if there was no account activity (i.e., if there is no new purchase made or order placed) for a period of twelve months. In March 2024, BRCC amended the Loyalty Program such that BRCC loyalty points expire after twelve months without consideration of account activity. The change in BRCC's Loyalty Program points policy resulted in a reduction to the deferred revenue liability and an increase to revenue in our Direct to Consumer Channel of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of changes in the amount of loyalty points that BRCC estimates will be redeemed. 
 
 For those points that are earned through other activities, the Company recognizes the redemption of these points as a discount to the transaction price at time of sale. Refer to Note 7, Deferred Revenue and Gift Card Liability for information about changes in the current portion of deferred revenue and gift card liability for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Franchise Store Revenues 
 
 Franchise rights may be granted through franchise agreements that set out the terms of the arrangement with the franchisee. The franchise agreements require that the franchisee remit continuing fees to the Company as a percentage of the applicable store s revenues in exchange for the license of the intellectual property associated with BRCC s brands. A portion of these fees are dedicated for national marketing campaigns, promotional programs and materials, and other activities that we believe enhance the image of the BRCC brand. Continuing fees represent a portion of the consideration the Company receives under the franchise agreement. Continuing fees are typically billed and collected weekly. Continuing fees are recognized as the related store sales occur. Revenues from continuing fees are included in "Revenue, net" on the unaudited consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Under the franchise agreements, BRCC sells products and equipment to its franchisees. The revenue associated with these product and equipment sales are recognized when control passes to the franchisee, typically at the date of delivery of the merchandise to the franchisee and in an amount that reflects the expected consideration to be received in exchange for such goods.

Table of Contents 

years. Revenues for these upfront franchise fees are recognized on a straight-line basis, which is consistent with the franchisee s right to use and benefit from the intellectual property associated with BRCC's brands. The current portion of revenues from upfront franchise fees are included in "Deferred revenue and gift card liability" and the long-term portion of revenues from upfront franchisee fees are included in "Other non-current liabilities" on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 License Revenues 
 
 License rights may be granted through license agreements that set out the terms of the Company s arrangement with the licensee. The Company s license agreements require that the licensee remit continuing fees to the Company as a percentage of the applicable store s revenues in exchange for the license of the intellectual property associated with BRCC s brands. In addition, licensed store revenues consist of product sales to the licensee. The revenue associated with these product sales are recognized when control of the product passes to the licensee, typically at the date of delivery of the merchandise to the licensee and in an amount that reflects the expected consideration to be received in exchange for such goods. Continuing fees are recognized as the related store sales occur. 
 
 The Company s license agreements also typically require upfront license fees such as initial fees paid for the execution of a license agreement. The fees associated with these agreements are typically billed and paid when a new license agreement becomes effective. The Company has determined the services it provides in exchange for upfront license fees, which primarily relate to initial license set up and are not individually distinct from the ongoing services it provides to its licensees. As a result, upfront license fees are recognized as revenue over the term of each respective license agreement, generally years. Revenues for these upfront license fees are recognized on a straight-line basis, which is consistent with the licensee s right to use and benefit from the intellectual property. Revenues from continuing fees and upfront license fees are presented within Revenue, net on the unaudited consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Disaggregation of Revenue 
 
 The Company disaggregates revenue by sales channel. The Wholesale channel includes product revenue sold to an intermediary and not directly to the consumer. The Direct to Consumer channel is principally comprised of revenue from our e-commerce websites and subscription services directly to the consumer. The Outpost channel includes revenue from Company-operated stores, gift cards, franchise stores and licensing. 
 
 Direct to Consumer Outpost Total net sales 
 
 Substantially all revenue is derived from customers located in the United States. One wholesale customer and its affiliate represented and of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. One wholesale customer and its affiliate represented and of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Sales Returns and Discounts 
 
 The Company s product sales contracts include terms that could cause variability in the transaction price for items such as discounts, credits, charge backs, or sales returns. Accordingly, the transaction price for product sales includes estimates of variable consideration to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur.

days of delivery, for most products the Company refunds the full cost of the merchandise less the original shipping charge and actual return shipping fees. If the customer returns an item that has been opened or shows signs of wear, the Company issues a partial refund minus the original shipping charge and actual return shipping fees. Bagged coffee and rounds are not eligible for returns. Revenue is recorded net of estimated returns. The Company records an allowance for returns based on current period revenues and historical returns experience. The Company analyzes actual historical returns, current economic trends and changes in order volume and acceptance of its products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance in any accounting period. The allowance for sales returns and charge backs was and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and included in "Accounts receivable, net" on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs 
 
 Shipping and handling is considered a fulfillment activity, as it takes place prior to the customer obtaining control of the merchandise, and fees charged to customers are included in net revenue upon completion of the performance obligation. 

. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these balances, and it believes credit risk to be minimal. 
 
 Restricted cash relates to amounts that are held by former lenders to secure certain commercial credit obligations until such obligations have been satisfied. 

The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 We recognize a right-of-use ROU asset and lease liability for each operating lease with a contractual term greater than twelve months at the time of lease inception. We do not record leases with an initial term of twelve months or less on our consolidated balance sheet but continue to record rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our leases often include options to extend or terminate at our sole discretion, which are included in the determination of the lease term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised.

 Overview 
 
 Black Rifle Coffee Company is a rapidly growing Veteran-led premium coffee and media company that operates through three channels: Wholesale, Direct to Consumer ("DTC"), and our Outpost Retail Stores. Our business started with a loyal and quickly expanding community of consumers through our DTC channel, which benefits from approximately 194,000 subscribers as of September 30, 2024. We have experienced recent declines in this channel as our points of distribution have expanded in other channels and consumers find the brand where they shop. Focused growth in our Wholesale channel continues as we have expanded into grocery stores, club stores, specialty stores, and other intermediaries. Our Outpost channel experienced growth through 2023 during the initial rollout of our Outpost retail stores; however, we anticipate limited growth in this channel in 2024 as we evaluate our strategy for retail stores, and we expect to recommence investment in this channel in future years. 
 
 At Black Rifle Coffee, we develop our roast profiles with the same mission focus we learned as military members serving our country. We produce creative and engaging cause-related media content to inform, inspire, entertain, and build our community. We also sell Black Rifle Coffee-brand apparel, coffee brewing equipment, and outdoor and lifestyle gear that our consumers proudly wear and use to showcase our brand. At the heart of everything we do is our commitment to supporting active duty military, Veterans, first responders, and those who love America. 
 
 We utilize a three-pronged approach to craft a unique brand that resonates with our customer base and enhances brand loyalty: Inform, Inspire, and Entertain. We want our audience to love coffee as much as we do, so we strive to inform them on all the awesome facets of coffee. Every day we work to inspire our customers; we take pride in the coffee we roast, the Veterans we employ and the causes we support. We give back to the community and are committed to support those who serve. 
 
 To support our premium quality product, our coffee beans are primarily roasted in-house at our Tennessee based roasting facility and 100 in the United States to ensure consistency and quality of product. Our coffee beans are sourced only from the highest quality suppliers. Our state-of-the-art equipment guarantees freshness and offers significant capacity for expansion. 
 
 We are a digitally native brand with an established omnichannel business model, reaching our customers through one reportable segment that is comprised of three channels. Our Wholesale channel includes products sold to an intermediary such as grocery stores, including the Food, Drug, and Mass ("FDM") customer set, specialty retailers, such as outdoors and sporting goods retailers, and convenience stores, which primarily sell our Ready-to-Drink ("RTD") products. Our DTC channel includes our e-commerce business, through which consumers order our products online and products are shipped to them. Our Outpost channel includes our Company-operated and franchised Black Rifle Coffee retail coffee shop locations. 
 
 Revenue decreased to 98.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 100.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of 2 compared to prior year, driven primarily by a 3.8 million decrease in our DTC channel and a 0.7 million decrease in our Outpost channel partially offset by a 2.1 million increase in Wholesale revenues. Revenue increased to 285.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 276.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing growth of 3 , compared to the prior year driven by a 26.3 million increase in Wholesale revenues, partially offset by declines of 12.5 million and 4.1 million in our DTC and Outpost channels, respectively.

The Business Combination 
 
 In February 2022, we completed the Business Combination and as a result of the consummation of a series of mergers in connection therewith, Authentic Brands became a subsidiary of BRC Inc., with BRC Inc. acting as the sole managing member thereof as a public benefit corporation. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and a recapitalization of Authentic Brands. Accordingly, the Business Combination was reflected as the equivalent of Authentic Brands issuing stock for the net assets of SilverBox, accompanied by a recapitalization. Under this method of accounting, SilverBox is treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. The net assets of SilverBox are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. This accounting treatment was determined by the individual controlling Authentic Brands prior to the Business Combination, who also controls the combined company post Business Combination. 
 
 Trends 
 
 Certain trends affecting our business within the respective sales channels are as follows: 
 
 Wholesale channel revenue has increased as we have added new customers and we continue to grow our presence in the FDM market. We expect to see increased revenue within this channel as we increase investment to obtain new customers, launch new products, and expand in the FDM market. 
 DTC channel revenue growth has declined as a result of a decline in the DTC market as well as our decision to redirect investments to other growing areas of the business as we continue to experience elevated DTC customer acquisition costs. In addition, we have limited our promotional offerings while focusing on profitability. 
 Outpost channel revenue has decreased due to declining volumes at our existing Outpost retail locations. We anticipate limited growth in this channel in 2024 as we shift investments into other channels while we work to improve the quality of our earnings through operational and strategic changes, some of which might result in store closures for underperforming Outposts. We expect accelerated growth in the Outpost channel in future years as we recommence investment in this part of our business. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 
 Our Ability to Increase Brand Awareness 
 
 Our ability to promote and maintain brand awareness and loyalty is critical to our success. We believe we have created a highly efficient marketing strategy that provides us the ability to increase brand awareness and drive consumer interaction. Consumer appreciation of our brands is primarily reflected in the increase of our sales across our three channels over the last few years. We expect to continue to develop and implement forward-looking brand strategies that utilize highly efficient, reach-based formats such as national television, streaming advertising, and other select avenues. In addition, we will leverage our social media footprint and employ targeted digital advertising to expand the reach of our brand. 
 
 Our Ability to Grow Our Customer Base in Our Outposts and Wholesale Channels 
 
 We are currently growing our customer base through our Wholesale channel. Our products are also sold through a growing number of physical retail channels. Wholesale customers include large national retailers, regional retailers, distributors, and dealers. 
 
 Our Ability to Acquire and Retain Customers at a Reasonable Cost 
 
 We believe our ability to consistently acquire and retain new customers at a reasonable cost will be a key factor affecting our future performance. We continue to have a strong presence activating in major markets to reach new consumers and drive brand awareness. As we continue to expand our deployment venues, our expertise in digital creative and engagement provides a distinct advantage to reach, engage and convert our consumers. We will continue to utilize marketing measurement to ensure our advertising and marketing spend is effective and efficient while expanding our brand reach and managing customer acquisition cost and returns on marketing investments.

 Our Ability to Drive Repeat Usage of Our Products 
 
 We gain substantial economic value from repeat users of our products who consistently re-order our products. The pace of our growth rate will be affected by the repeat usage dynamics of existing and newly acquired customers. 
 
 Our Ability to Expand Our Product Line 
 
 Our goal is to continue to expand our product line over time to increase our growth opportunity and reduce product-specific risks through diversification into multiple products each designed around daily use. Our pace of growth will be partially affected by the cadence and magnitude of new product launches over time. We realized All Commodities Volume ("ACV") of 47 at September 30, 2024. Moving forward, we believe that it is important to our business that we continue innovating with new products and flavors. 
 
 Our Ability to Manage Our Supply Chain 
 
 Our ability to grow and meet future demand will be affected by our ability to properly plan for and source inventory from a variety of suppliers and co-manufacturers located inside and outside the United States. The majority of our green coffee beans come from Colombia, Nicaragua, and Brazil, and since 2020, we have also sourced green coffee beans from over ten countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia to diversify our supply chain and offer our customers specialty and limited-time-only roasts. Quality control is also a critically important part of our manufacturing and supply chain operations. 100 of our coffee is roasted in the United States. Our licensed, Coffee Quality Institute-certified grader and former Green Beret, leads cupping, grading, scoring, and sourcing of our coffees. We also must effectively manage our co-manufacturers and suppliers.

 Components of Our Operating Income (Loss) 
 
 Revenue, net 
 
 We sell our products both directly and indirectly to our customers through a broad set of physical and online platforms. Our net revenue reflects the impact of product returns as well as discounts and fees for certain sales programs, trade spend, promotions, and loyalty rewards. 
 
 Cost of goods sold 
 
 Cost of goods sold primarily includes raw material costs, labor costs directly related to producing our products including wages and benefits, shipping costs, and other overhead costs related to certain aspects of production, warehousing, fulfillment expense, shipping, and credit card fees. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 
 Operating expenses consist of marketing and advertising expenses related to brand marketing campaigns through various online platforms, including email, digital, website, social media, search engine optimization, as well as performance marketing efforts including retargeting, paid search and product advertisements, as well as social media advertisements and sponsorships. Operating expenses also consist of salaries, wages, and benefits of payroll and payroll related expenses for labor not directly related to producing our products. Payroll expenses include both fixed and variable compensation. Variable compensation includes bonuses and equity-based compensation. General and administration costs include other professional fees and services, and general corporate infrastructure expenses, including utilities and depreciation and amortization.

 Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.3 million, or 2 , to 98.2 million as compared to 100.5 million for the corresponding period in 2023. 
 
 The following table summarizes net sales by channel for the periods indicated dollars in thousands, unaudited ): 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Wholesale 63,655 61,527 2,128 3 Direct to Consumer 29,044 32,794 (3,750) (11) Outpost 5,505 6,215 (710) (11) Total net sales 98,204 100,536 (2,332) (2) 
 
 Net revenue for our Wholesale channel for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 2.1 million, or 3 , to 63.7 million as compared to 61.5 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The Wholesale channel performance was primarily driven by growth in distribution of packaged coffee in the FDM market along with increased sales in our RTD product line, partially offset by a 4.2 million decrease related to barter transactions whereby we exchanged finished goods inventory for prepaid advertising credits and decreases in some declining categories impacting select retailers.

 Net revenue for our DTC channel for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3.8 million, or 11 , to 29.0 million as compared to 32.8 million for the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to lower customer acquisition due to declines in the overall DTC market, a strategic shift in advertising spend to other areas with higher returns, and an increase in points of distribution in the Wholesale channel, that provides increased brick and mortar availability for the Black Rifle Coffee consumer. 
 
 Net revenue for our Outpost channel for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 0.7 million, or 11 , to 5.5 million as compared to 6.2 million for the corresponding period in 2023. Revenue decreased primarily due to lower transaction volumes due to lower Retail traffic. 
 
 Cost of goods sold 
 
 Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 9.6 million, or 14 , to 56.9 million as compared to 66.5 million for the corresponding period in 2023. Gross margin increased to 42 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 34 for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in gross margin was a result of product mix shift driven by an increase in the higher margin FDM market, productivity improvements in our RTD products, lower warehousing costs, and favorable changes in inventory reserves. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 
 Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.8 million, or 2 , to 40.2 million as compared to 41.0 million for the corresponding period in 2023. 
 
 The following table summarizes operating expenses for the periods indicated dollars in thousands, unaudited ):

 Marketing and advertising expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.8 million, or 22 , to 10.1 million as compared to 8.3 million for the corresponding period in 2023. This increase was due to our expansion of partnerships, including our engagement with UFC, higher advertising spend, incremental shopper marketing, and an increase in trade promotions. 
 
 Salaries, wages and benefits expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.6 million, or 19 , to 16.5 million as compared to 13.9 million for the corresponding period in 2023. This increase was related to a reduction in incentive compensation in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 7.2 million, or 37 , to 12.3 million as compared to 19.5 million for the corresponding period in 2023. This decrease was due to reductions in our corporate infrastructure and support that were inefficient or duplicative, including professional services, information technology, and office space. 
 
 Other operating expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.3 million as compared to other operating income, net, of 0.6 million for the corresponding period in 2023. Other operating income, net in 2023 related to a gain on assets held for sale offset by loss on disposal of equipment while the 2024 operating expense was primarily comprised of costs incurred related to site termination costs.

 Net revenue for our Wholesale channel for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 26.3 million, or 17 , to 177.8 million as compared to 151.5 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The Wholesale channel performance was primarily driven by continued growth of packaged coffee in the FDM market. In addition, we had a net 7.7 million increase in revenue recognized related to a barter transaction whereby we exchanged finished goods inventory for prepaid advertising credits. 
 
 Net revenue for our DTC channel for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 12.5 million, or 12 , to 91.6 million as compared to 104.2 million for the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to lower customer acquisition due to declines in the overall DTC market, a strategic shift in advertising spend to other areas with higher returns, and an increase in points of distribution in the Wholesale channel, that provides increased brick and mortar availability for the Black Rifle Coffee consumer. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of 5.7 million as a result of the decrease in the accrual for loyalty rewards points as a result of BRCC's change in policy around expiration of points in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Net revenue for our Outpost channel for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 4.1 million, or 20 , to 16.1 million as compared to 20.3 million for the corresponding period in 2023. Revenue decreased primarily due to lower transaction volumes across all stores in the first half of 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023, due to lower Retail traffic. 
 
 Cost of goods sold 
 
 Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 17.4 million, or 10 , to 164.8 million as compared to 182.2 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Gross margin increased to 42 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 34 for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in gross margin was a result of product mix shift driven by an increase in the higher margin FDM market, productivity improvements in our RTD products, and lower warehousing costs.

 Marketing and advertising expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.7 million, or 12 , to 25.1 million as compared to 22.4 million for the corresponding period in 2023. This increase was due to our expansion of partnerships, including our engagement with UFC, higher advertising spend, incremental shopper marketing, and an increase in trade promotions. 
 
 Salaries, wages and benefits expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.7 million, or 5 , to 49.4 million as compared to 52.1 million for the corresponding period in 2023. This decrease, as part of our cost savings initiative, was primarily due to lower compensation costs driven by reductions in headcount during 2023 for which we realized the full benefit in 2024. 
 
 General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 17.9 million, or 32 , to 38.6 million as compared to 56.5 million for the corresponding period in 2023. This decrease, as part of our cost savings initiative, was due to reductions in our corporate infrastructure and support that were inefficient or duplicative, including professional services, information technology, and office space. 
 
 Other operating expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.9 million, or 116 , to 1.6 million as compared to 0.7 million for the corresponding period in 2023.

 Components of Our Non-Operating Expenses 
 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The following table summarizes non-operating expenses for the periods indicated dollars in thousands, unaudited ): 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Interest expense, net (2,453) (3,544) (1,091) (31) Other expense, net (108) (108) (100) Total non-operating expenses (2,453) (3,652) (1,199) (33) 
 
 Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.1 million, or 31 , to 2.5 million as compared to 3.5 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to interest on a bridge loan as well as a loss on extinguishment of debt both incurred in the third quarter of 2023 in connection with the refinancing whereby we entered into a new 75.0 million senior credit facility, a 50.0 million term loan facility, and a 6.0 million bridge loan. The bridge loan was repaid during 2023. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of increases in average debt balance and higher interest rates under the new senior credit facility and term loan facility which bear interest at the term SOFR plus 2.60 to 3.10 , based on average excess availability of the borrowing base and term SOFR plus 8.50 , respectively. This is compared to the interest rate under the previous senior credit facility of Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield plus 2.00 to 2.25 , based on average excess availability of the borrowing base.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity Overview 
 
 Our principal use of cash is to support the growth of our business, including increasing working capital requirements related to inventories, accounts receivable, and general and administrative expenses. Furthermore, we use cash to fund our debt service commitments, capital equipment acquisitions, and other growth-related needs. 
 
 Our primary sources of cash are (1) cash on hand, (2) cash provided by operating activities, and (3) net borrowings from our credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents was 7.3 million, our working capital was 12.4 million, and under our credit facilities, we had 9.4 million of available borrowings, after the consideration of the 15.0 million reduction required before the Availability Block Release Date, the date on which we have maintained a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 to 1.00 based on a trailing four fiscal quarter calculation for two consecutive fiscal quarters following August 10, 2023, and no defaults or events of default are then continuing. Our ability to draw from the credit facilities is subject to a borrowing base and other covenants. There are no defaults or events of default at this time. We believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and to meet our commitments in the ordinary course of business and under the current market conditions for at least the next twelve months.

 Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated dollars in thousands, unaudited ): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 9,145 (40,359) 49,504 123 Investing activities (6,096) (13,296) (7,200) (54) Financing activities (9,311) 22,797 (32,108) (141) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in operating activities of 40.4 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The total increase of 49.5 million in net cash provided was primarily due to a net loss of 42.7 million improving to net loss of 0.9 million for 2024. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in investing activities of 13.3 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The 7.2 million decrease in net cash used was primarily due to reduced capital expenditure projects for our Outpost locations, roasting facilities and information technology. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 22.8 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The 32.1 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from issuance of long-term debt net of debt issuance costs of 84.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in repayments of long-term debt of 52.6 million. 
 
 Commitments 
 
 The Company has entered into several manufacturing and purchase agreements to purchase coffee products from third-party suppliers. The minimum purchase amounts are based on quantity and in the aggregate will be approximately 5.7 million for the remainder of 2024; 26.1 million for 2025; and 30.0 million for 2026. See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report for information regarding such manufacturing and purchase agreements. 
 
 Liabilities relating to operating leases that have commenced as of September 30, 2024 have been reported on the balance sheet as operating lease liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, we have entered into operating leases that have not yet commenced which primarily relate to real estate leases. These leases will commence in fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2025 with lease terms of 15 years. Payments on leases are expected to be approximately 3.6 million in the next twelve months, and approximately 37.9 million beyond twelve months through 2043. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Future capital requirements will vary materially from period to period and will depend on factors such as adding additional roasting capacity, expansion of our corporate and information technology infrastructure relating to growth initiatives and expansion and growth by opening additional Company-operated Outposts. We currently expect to fund our material capital requirements with borrowings from our credit facilities, but we may also seek additional debt or equity financing.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Commodity Risks 
 
 Our profitability is dependent on, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in costs of key operating resources. Commodity price risk is our primary market risk, which is affected by purchases of coffee beans, dairy products, aluminum cans and other materials and commodities. We purchase and roast quality coffee beans that can be subject to significant volatility. Increases in the C coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality coffee. We generally enter into fixed price purchase commitments for the green coffee we roast. 
 
 The supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather (including the potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, crop disease, inventory levels, and political and economic conditions. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices, increases in the cost of high-quality coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Our Term Loan Facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to either (i) a base rate plus 7.50 or (ii) term SOFR plus 8.50 . Borrowings under our ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum of either (i) the Base Rate (as defined below) plus a margin ranging from 1.50 to 2.00 or (ii) term SOFR plus a margin ranging from 2.60 to 3.10 . "Base Rate" means, for any day, the base commercial lending rate of PNC as publicly announced to be in effect from time to time. We seek to manage exposure to adverse interest rate changes through our normal operating and financing activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 49.4 million outstanding on our Term Loan Facility and 18.8 million outstanding on our ABL Facility with available borrowings of 9.4 million. The carrying value of the variable interest rate debt approximates its fair value as the borrowings are based on market interest rates. A hypothetical increase of interest rates of 5 on our outstanding variable rate borrowings would result in additional interest expense annually of approximately 3.4 million. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our products, overhead costs and parcel freight costs have had an impact on our operating results. While we have begun to partially offset inflation and other changes in costs of essential operating resources by slightly increasing prices, along with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. From time to time, competitive conditions could limit our pricing flexibility. There can be no assurance that future cost increases can be offset by increased prices or that increased prices will be fully absorbed by our customers without any resulting change to their purchasing patterns. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will generate overall revenue growth in an amount sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures. The cost of constructing our Outposts is subject to inflation, which could increase the costs of labor and materials. An increasing rate of inflation in the future may have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross profit and operating expenses, if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we completed the implementation of a procure to payment system. As part of this implementation, we assessed the impact to the control environment and modified internal controls where necessary. 
 
 Except for the procure to payment system implementation discussed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
