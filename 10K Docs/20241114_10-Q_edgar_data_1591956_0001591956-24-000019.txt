 Overview 
 In January 2022, we commenced operations of our Bitcoin mining business and are dedicated to becoming a leader in the Blockchain and Crypto Industry. We have established and continue to grow an enterprise-scale mining operation through the procurement of mining equipment and partnering with experienced service providers. In addition to Bitcoin mining, through December 28, 2023, we delivered data management and desktop and application virtualization solutions through hybrid cloud, cloud and on premise implementations by its reseller network. We achieved this through a combination of containerized applications, virtual desktops, virtual storage and physical hyper-converged platforms. On December 28, 2023, we sold our service and product segment which included HVE ConneXions and Unified ConneXions. 
 26 

We obtain Bitcoin as a result of our mining operations, and we sell Bitcoin to support our operations and strategic growth. We currently mine Bitcoin in Missouri, Texas and Iowa, which these states do not have any material state-specific regulatory restrictions on the mining of Bitcoin. However, it is possible that these states or other states in which we may seek to operate may create laws that would impede Bitcoin mining. We do not currently plan to engage in regular trading of Bitcoin other than sales to convert our Bitcoin into U.S. dollars. Decisions to hold or sell Bitcoins are currently determined by management by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time. We have a hybrid treasury strategy to hold Bitcoin when possible, and sell to fund working capital requirements. 
 We are strategizing for our future growth by refreshing a significant portion of our fleet with newer-generation machines to bolster efficiency. We expect this to lead to greater gross profits given that more efficient machines typically use less power and generate more Bitcoin. As a result of our strategic changes, during the third quarter of 2024 mining production decreased as we focused on our long-term strategic goals of transitioning to lower-cost hosting sites and refreshing our fleet with newer-generation machines. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 also reflects a significant change at one hosting site, where the hosting provider bought out our contract. We are currently evaluating machines from this site and are actively exploring more affordable hosting options. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned approximately 15,000 miners, of which approximately 6,400 were in service. We do not have scheduled downtime for our miners. During the third quarter of 2024, we have started the process of removing our older machines and replacing them with newer generation machines, and expect this to continue through the first quarter of 2025. In addition, we plan to continue to acquire new generation miners as we expand our exahash. We periodically perform both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on our miners, but such downtime has not historically been significant. Depending on the type of repair, the miner may run at a reduced speed or be taken offline. We use multiple software programs to monitor the performance of our machines. The miners owned as of September 30, 2024 have a range of energy efficiency (joules per terahash J/th of 21.5 to 38 J/th with an average energy efficiency of 28.4 J/th. The miner efficiency is an indication of how efficient we can earn Bitcoin and minimize cost to run the miner. At this time, we intend only to mine Bitcoin and we hold no other cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. We do not have any power purchase agreements for the supply of power. 
 We currently have service agreements with Foundry Digital LLC and Luxor Technology Corporation, each a cryptocurrency mining pool operator, to provide a service to perform hash calculations. In exchange for providing the service, we are entitled to Full Pay Per Share FPPS ), which is a fractional share of the fixed Bitcoin award the applicable mining pool operators receives, plus a fractional share of the transaction fees attached to that blockchain, less net cryptocurrency fees due to the mining pool operators over the measurement period, as applicable. The pay-outs that we receive are based on the expected value from the block reward plus the transaction fee reward, regardless of whether the applicable mining pool operators successfully records a block to the blockchain. Our fractional share is based on a contractual formula, which primarily calculates the hash rate provided to the mining pool as a percentage of total network hash rate and other inputs. The service agreements are terminable at any time by either party without compensation, and our enforceable right to compensation only begins when we begin providing hash calculation services to the applicable mining pool operators, which occurs daily at midnight Universal Time Coordinated UTC time ). 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 1.3 Bitcoin. The fair value of our Bitcoin as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 0.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet. We account for our Bitcoin as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Effective January 1, 2024, we early adopted ASU 2023-08, Intangibles - Goodwill - and Other - Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) : Accounting For and Disclosure of Crypto Assets ASU 2023-08 and recorded a 20,000 decrease to the opening balance of accumulated deficit and an increase to digital assets. The new guidance requires Bitcoin to be valued at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of Bitcoin is measured using the period-end closing price from the Company s principal market. When Bitcoin is sold, the gains and losses from such transactions are measured as the difference between the cash proceeds and the carrying basis of the Bitcoin as determined on a first in-first out FIFO basis and are recorded within the same line item, Change in fair value of Bitcoin, in the consolidated statements of operations.

Recent Key Events 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we have deployed approximately an additional 350 Q4 Bitmain Antminer S21s, as well, we have 1,000 XP miners acquired in September 2024, which we anticipate to be energized in the fourth quarter of 2024, adding 0.21 EH/s to our overall hash rate and expanding our fleet with the latest generation of high-efficiency miners. The total miner fleet now includes a significant number of Bitmain S21 and S21 Pro machines, contributing close to 0.2 EH/s in additional hash rate. 
 On October 10, 2024, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC notifying us that we were not in compliance with the requirement of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued inclusion on the NASDAQ Capital Market as a result of the closing bid price for our common shares being below 1.00 for 30 consecutive business days. This notification has no effect on the listing of our common shares at this time. In accordance with the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, we were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance, which required a closing bid price for our common shares above 1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. On November 14, 2024, our common shares closing bid price was above 1.00 for 20 consecutive business days. 
 In September 2024, Sphere 3D Corp. and Simple Mining LLC Simple Mining entered into a letter of intent to acquire a 12.5 MW site in Iowa featuring average sub 4c energy. We have partnered with Simple Mining to engineer, develop, and operate the site. Additionally, we will enter into a Managed Service Agreement MSA with Simple Mining to operate the site on our behalf. The MSA is expected to be a three-year contract, with the option to renew or terminate annually. 
 In August 2024, we received a termination fee of 3.0 million to settle all matters pertaining to a terminated hosting agreement including all services and deposit prepayments for estimated services fees. 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we issued 4,626,133 common shares for the conversion of 32,383 Series H Preferred Shares. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we issued 297,713 common shares for the conversion of 2,084 Series H Preferred Shares. 
 Results of Operations 
 The Third Quarter of 2024 Compared with the Third Quarter of 2023 
 Revenue 
 We generated revenues of 2.4 million and 5.7 million during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 3.3 million decrease in revenue is primarily due to one of our hosting providers taking approximately 3,300, or 22 , of our mining machines offline in the third quarter of 2024 to relocate them and such machines are pending redeployment. In addition, beginning the third quarter of 2024, we are in the process of removing our older mining equipment and replacing it with newer generation machines. This is expected to be an ongoing process through the first quarter of 2025 which may result in fluctuations in exahash. There was also a decrease in revenues of 0.6 million related to our former Service and Product segment which was sold in December 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, all of our revenue was derived from Bitcoin mining. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Cost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense) 
 Direct cost of revenues during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were 2.7 million and 4.5 million, respectively, representing a decrease of 1.8 million primarily due to lower hosting fees due to machines being taken offline to be relocated and the transition of removing older mining machines and replacing them with newer generation machines, as well the prior year disposal of our Service and Product segment. 
 28 

Sales and Marketing Expense 
 Sales and marketing expenses were nil and 0.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 0.2 million was due to the sale of our Service and Product segment in December 2023 and we no longer have sales and marketing expenses. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expenses were nil and 0.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 0.4 million was due to the sale of our Service and Product segment in December 2023 and we no longer have research and development expense. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expenses were 3.0 million and 3.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. The decrease of 0.4 million was due to a decrease of 0.3 million associated with outside services related to our expansion into the cryptocurrency industry, a 0.2 million decrease in share-based compensation, a 0.2 million decrease related to operating costs for our former special purpose acquisition company which no longer exists for 2024, and a 0.1 million decrease in director fees due to the reduction in number of board members. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 0.4 million primarily associated with legal fees. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 1.7 million and 2.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 0.3 million was primarily due to lessor depreciation related to our Bitcoin mining machines due to current year sales of machines and the impairment in the second quarter of 2024, resulting in a lower cost basis to be depreciated over the remaining useful life. 
 Impairment of Acquired Intangible Assets 
 Impairment of acquired intangible assets was nil and 1.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The impairment was due to an adverse change in the business climate which indicated that an impairment triggering event occurred for one supplier agreement, and we determined the carrying value of the finite-lived intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value. 
 Loss on Disposal of Property and Equipment 
 Loss on disposal of property and equipment was nil and 0.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and the prior year related to the sale of mining equipment. 
 Change in Fair Value of Bitcoin 
 Change in fair value of Bitcoin was 8,000 and nil for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Effective January 1, 2024, we early adopted ASU 2023-08 and recorded a 20,000 decrease to the opening balance of accumulated deficit and an increase to digital assets. The loss in the third quarter of 2024 is the change in fair value of the Bitcoin held, as well as the gains and losses from when the Bitcoin was sold. Sale transactions are measured as the difference between the cash proceeds and the carrying basis of the Bitcoin as determined on a FIFO basis. 
 Realized Gain on Sale of Bitcoin 
 Realized gain on sale of Bitcoin was nil and 0.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The third quarter of 2023 is due to the sale of Bitcoin and the difference between the sales proceeds from the Bitcoin and the carrying amount. Typically gains are higher when Bitcoin prices are increasing over a holding period. Effective January 1, 2024, we early adopted ASU 2023-08, and in accordance with the new guidance we no longer report impairment of Bitcoin and realized gain on sale of Bitcoin separately. Instead, current period comparable information is reported in the line item Change in fair value of Bitcoin in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 29 

Impairment of Bitcoin 
 Impairment of Bitcoin was nil and 0.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Effective January 1, 2024, we early adopted ASU 2023-08, and in accordance with the new guidance we no longer report impairment of Bitcoin and realized gain on sale of Bitcoin separately. Instead, current period comparable information is reported in the line item Change in fair value of Bitcoin in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 Non-Operating Income and Expenses 
 Unrealized Loss on Investment in Equity Securities 
 Unrealized loss on investment in equity securities was 0.4 million and nil for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The loss was related to our equity investment in Core Scientific Inc., a publicly traded company. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net was 5.8 million and 0.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The third quarter of 2024 other income, net, primarily related to a realized gain of 2.9 million on the partial sale of our equity investment in Core Scientific Inc., and 3.0 million for the early termination of a hosting agreement. The third quarter of 2023 other income, net, primarily related to a 0.2 million fair value adjustment for warrant liabilities offset by 0.1 million for extinguishment of debt. 
 The First Nine Months of 2024 Compared with the First Nine Months of 2023 
 Revenue 
 We generated revenues of 14.0 million and 14.2 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 0.2 million decrease in revenue is primarily due to an increase of 1.4 million in revenues from our Bitcoin mining operation for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, offset by a decrease of 1.6 million related to our former Service and Product segment which was sold in December 2023. In July 2024, one of our hosting providers took approximately 3,300, or 22 , of our mining machines offline to relocate them and such machines are pending redeployment. In addition, beginning the third quarter of 2024, we are in the process of removing our older mining equipment and replacing it with newer generation machines. This is expected to be an ongoing process through the first quarter of 2025 which may result in fluctuations in exahash. During the first nine months of 2024, all of our revenue was derived from Bitcoin mining. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Cost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense) 
 Direct cost of revenues during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 11.0 million and 11.1 million, respectively, representing a decrease of 0.1 million primarily due to the prior year disposal of our Service and Product segment, and the decrease in miners deployed as we refresh our fleet by removing older mining machines and replacing them with newer generation machines. 
 Sales and Marketing Expense 
 Sales and marketing expenses were nil and 0.8 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 0.8 million was due to the sale of our Service and Product segment in December 2023 and we no longer have sales and marketing expenses. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expenses were nil and 0.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 0.9 million was due to the sale of our Service and Product segment in December 2023 and we no longer have research and development expense. 
 30 

General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expenses were 9.5 million and 10.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 1.0 million was primarily due to a decrease of 0.9 million related to operating costs for our former special purpose acquisition company which no longer exists for 2024, a 0.7 million decrease associated with outside services related to our expansion into the cryptocurrency industry, an aggregate 0.2 million decrease in legal fees associated with our Bitcoin mining operation and insurance cost, and a 0.2 million decrease in investor relations. These decreases were offset by an increase of 0.5 million in share-based compensation primarily related to awards to certain executives, an increase of 0.2 million for employee and related expenses, and a 0.2 million increase in costs related to strategic business growth. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 5.4 million and 4.4 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 1.0 million was primarily due to depreciation related to our Bitcoin mining machines.

 Impairment of Acquired Intangible Assets 
 Impairment of acquired intangible assets was nil and 1.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The impairment was due to an adverse change in the business climate which indicated that an impairment triggering event occurred for one supplier agreement, and we determined the carrying value of the finite-lived intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value. 
 Loss on Disposal of Property and Equipment 
 Loss on disposal of property and equipment was 0.7 million and 0.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and related to the sale of mining equipment. 
 Change in Fair Value of Bitcoin 
 Change in fair value of Bitcoin was 0.7 million and nil for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Effective January 1, 2024, we early adopted ASU 2023-08 and recorded a 20,000 decrease to the opening balance of accumulated deficit and an increase to digital assets. The gain in the first nine months of 2024 is the change in fair value of the Bitcoin held, as well as the gains and losses from when the Bitcoin was sold. Sale transactions are measured as the difference between the cash proceeds and the carrying basis of the Bitcoin as determined on a FIFO basis. 
 Realized Gain on Sale of Bitcoin 
 Realized gain on sale of Bitcoin was nil and 0.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 31 

Non-Operating Income and Expenses 
 Unrealized Gain on Investment in Equity Securities 
 Unrealized gain on investment in equity securities was 4.1 million and nil for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The gain was related to our equity investment in Core Scientific Inc., a publicly traded company. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net was 6.5 million and 1.5 million of income, net, for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The first nine months of 2024 other income, net, primarily related to a 3.4 million realized gain on the partial sale of our equity investment in Core Scientific Inc., 3.0 million for the early termination of a hosting agreement, and a 0.2 million fair value adjustment for warrant liabilities. The first nine months of 2023 other income, net, primarily related to a 1.1 million fair value adjustment for warrant liabilities, 0.2 million for cancellation of warrant liabilities, and 0.2 million in interest income from restricted funds held in trust. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was nil and 1.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The first nine months of 2023 interest expense was primarily 1.0 million for warrants issued with our LDA convertible debt and 0.2 million of debt costs. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have recurring year to date losses from operations. Our primary source of cash flow is generated from Bitcoin mining revenue. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 5.0 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of 0.6 million at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 11.0 million reflecting an increase of 2.8 million since December 31, 2023 primarily related to an increase in cash and the unrealized gain on our investment in equity securities. Cash management continues to be a priority and we are phasing out high-cost hosting contracts, leveraging our access to capital, and reducing our overall mining costs. 
 Management has projected that based on our recurring losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, and our hashing rate at September 30, 2024, cash on hand may not be sufficient to allow us to continue operations and there is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date of issuance of the financial statements if we are unable to raise additional funding for operations. We expect our working capital needs to increase in the future as we continue to expand and enhance our operations. Included in our working capital is an investment in equity securities that we can liquidate as needed to assist in funding our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds for working capital through equity or debt financings or other sources may depend on the financial success of our business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we require additional capital and are unsuccessful in raising that capital at a reasonable cost and at the required time, or at all, we may not be able to continue our business operations in the cryptocurrency mining industry or we may be unable to advance our growth initiatives, either of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In an effort to mitigate these risks we expect to take steps to lower our cost of mining and also refresh our mining fleet to increase our mining efficiency. 
 Significant changes from our current forecasts, including but not limited to: (i) shortfalls from projected mining earning levels; (ii) increases in operating costs; (iii) decreases in the value of cryptocurrency; and (iv) we do not maintain compliance with the requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market and/or we do not maintain our listing with the NASDAQ Capital Market could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access the level of funding necessary to continue our operations at current levels. These factors, among others, should they occur may result in our inability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date of issuance of the financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

The following table shows a summary of our cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (3,064) (6,024) Net cash provided by investing activities 7,428 2,437 Net cash provided by financing activities 2,859 
 Net cash used in operating activities . The use of cash during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily a result of our net loss of 2.2 million, offset by 1.5 million in non-cash items, which primarily included an unrealized gain on investment in equity securities, realized gain on investment in equity securities, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, impairment of property and equipment, loss on disposal of property and equipment, change in fair value of Bitcoin, Bitcoin issued for services, and change in fair value of warrant liabilities. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities. During the first nine months of 2024, we received 10.5 million from proceeds from the sale of investment in equity securities and 1.5 million from proceeds from the sale of Bitcoin, offset by 4.6 million of payments for the purchase of property and equipment consisting of newer generation mining machines. During the first nine months of 2023, we sold 2,925 miners originally included in mining equipment, for cash proceeds of 4.1 million, our SPAC received 10.3 million from the redemption of the trust account and paid 10.4 million for the redemption of the redeemable non-controlling interest related to MEOA, and we paid 1.6 million towards digital asset mining machines and shipping costs. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities. For the first nine months of 2023, we received 3.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares and warrants, 0.8 million, net, from the issuance of a convertible note, and 0.3 million from the exercise of stock options. These inflows were offset by 1.3 million of payments made on our convertible debt which was paid in full in August 2023.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 An investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the risk factors and other information included or incorporated by reference to this report, you should carefully consider each of the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and EDGAR at www.sec.gov. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the risks occur, our business and financial results could be harmed and the trading price of our common shares could decline. 
 Changing environmental regulation and public energy policy may expose our business to new risks. 
 Our Bitcoin mining operations require a substantial amount of power and can only be successful, and ultimately profitable, if the costs we incur, including for electricity, are lower than the revenue we generate from our operations. As a result, any mine we establish can only be successful if we can obtain sufficient electrical power for that mine on a cost-effective basis, and our establishment of new mines requires us to find locations where that is the case. For instance, our plans and strategic initiatives for expansion are based, in part, on our understanding of current environmental and energy regulations, policies, and initiatives enacted by regulators, and any such regulations that may be adopted in the future. Although we are not currently subject to environmental and energy regulations, policies or initiatives in Missouri, Texas or Iowa, the states in which we currently mine Bitcoin, related to our Bitcoin mining operations, if new regulations in these jurisdictions are imposed, or if we begin mining Bitcoin in other jurisdictions that do have such regulations, policies or initiatives, the assumptions we made underlying our plans and strategic initiatives may be inaccurate, and we may incur additional costs to adapt our planned business, if we are able to adapt at all, to such regulations. 
 There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty for our business because the Bitcoin mining industry, with its high energy demand, may become a target for future environmental and energy regulation. New legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. Further, any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. For example, the recently passed legislation in the state of New York imposing a two-year moratorium on certain Bitcoin mining operations that run carbon-based power. 
 Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be addressed, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 
 Bitcoin mining activities are energy-intensive, which may restrict the geographic locations of miners and have a negative environmental impact. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations, such as ours, or even fully or partially ban mining operations. 
 Mining Bitcoin requires large amounts of electrical power, and electricity costs are expected to account for a significant portion of our overall costs. The availability and cost of electricity may restrict the geographic locations of our mining activities. Any shortage of electricity supply or increase in electricity costs in any location where we plan to operate may negatively impact the viability and the expected economic return for Bitcoin mining activities in that location and may negatively impact our business model. While the increase in cost of power is mitigated by our fixed price contracts, we are unable to control power outages due to factors such as inclement weather or state requests to curtail our use of power may impact our gross profit. Although we do not have any power purchase contracts directly with any utilities, we have been advised by our hosting partners that they have such contracts. In most cases we have a fixed cost of power built into our contracts with our hosting partners. 
 35 

Further, our business model can only be successful and our mining operations can only be profitable if the costs, including electrical power costs, associated with Bitcoin mining are lower than the price of Bitcoin itself. As a result, any mining operation we establish can only be successful if we can obtain sufficient electrical power for that site on a cost-effective basis, and our establishment of new mining data centers requires us to find sites where that is the case. Even if our electrical power costs do not increase, significant fluctuations in, and any prolonged periods of, low Bitcoin prices will decrease our gross profit and may also cause our electrical supply to no longer be cost-effective. 
 Furthermore, there may be significant competition for suitable cryptocurrency mining sites, and government regulators, including local permitting officials, may potentially restrict our ability to set up cryptocurrency mining operations in certain locations. They can also restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations in times of electricity shortage, or may otherwise potentially restrict or prohibit the provision of electricity to mining operations. In addition, if cryptocurrency mining becomes more widespread, government scrutiny related to restrictions on cryptocurrency mining facilities and their energy consumption may significantly increase. The considerable consumption of electricity by mining operators may also have a negative environmental impact, including contribution to climate change, which could set the public opinion against allowing the use of electricity for Bitcoin mining activities or create a negative consumer sentiment and perception of Bitcoin. This, in turn, could lead to governmental measures restricting or prohibiting cryptocurrency mining or the use of electricity for Bitcoin mining activities. Any such development in the jurisdictions where we plan to operate could increase our compliance burdens and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. Government regulators in other countries may also ban or substantially limit their local cryptocurrency mining activities, which could have a material effect on our supply chains for mining equipment or services and the price of Bitcoin. It could also increase our domestic competition as some of those cryptocurrency miners or new entrants in this market may consider moving their cryptocurrency mining operations or establishing new operations in the United States. 
 Additionally, our mining operations could be materially adversely affected by power outages and similar disruptions. Given the power requirements for our mining equipment, it would not be feasible to run this equipment on back-up power generators in the event of a government restriction on electricity or a power outage. If we are unable to receive adequate power supply and are forced to reduce our operations due to the availability or cost of electrical power, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. 
 As cryptocurrencies may be determined to be investment securities, we may inadvertently violate the Investment Company Act of 1940 and incur large losses as a result and potentially be required to register as an investment company or terminate operations and we may incur third-party liabilities. 
 In general, novel or unique assets such as Bitcoin may be classified as securities if they meet the definition of investment contracts under U.S. law. In recent years, the offer and sale of digital assets other than Bitcoin, most notably Kik Interactive Inc. s Kin tokens and Telegram Group Inc. s TON tokens, have been deemed to be investment contracts by the SEC. The SEC has also sued Genesis Global Capital LLC and Gemini Trust Company LLC over their crypto-lending program that allegedly violated investor-protection laws. While we believe that Bitcoin is unlikely to be considered an investment contract, and thus a security under the investment contract definition, we cannot provide any assurances that Bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account will never be classified as a security under U.S. law. Our determination that Bitcoin is not a security is a risk-based assessment, not a legal standard binding on any regulatory body or court, and such determination does not preclude legal or regulatory action. If Bitcoin were to be classified as a security under U.S. law, we would be obligated to comply with registration and other requirements by the SEC, which would cause us to incur significant, non-recurring expenses which would materially and adversely impact your investment. 
 We believe that we are not engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and we do not hold ourself out as being engaged in those activities. However, under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ), a company may be deemed an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(C) thereof if the value of its investment securities is more than 40 of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. 
 36 

As a result of our investments and our mining activities, the investment securities we hold could exceed 40 of our total assets, exclusive of cash items and, accordingly, we could determine that we have become an inadvertent investment company. The cryptocurrency that we own, acquire or mine may be deemed an investment security by the SEC, and although we do not believe any of the cryptocurrency we own, acquire or mine are securities, any determination we make regarding whether cryptocurrencies are a security is a risk-based assessment, not a legal standard binding on a regulatory body or court, and does not preclude legal or regulatory action. An inadvertent investment company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can rely on one of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion, Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, allows an inadvertent investment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of (a) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50 of the issuer s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (b) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 of the value of such issuer s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, we do not believe we are an inadvertent investment company. We may take actions to cause the investment securities held by us to be less than 40 of our total assets, which may include acquiring assets with our cash and cryptocurrency on hand or liquidating our investment securities or cryptocurrency or seeking a no-action letter from the SEC if we are unable to acquire sufficient assets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in a timely manner. 
 As the Rule 3a-2 exception is available to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available to us, we would have to keep within the 40 limit for at least three years after we cease being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit our ability to make certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on our earnings. In any event, we do not intend to become an investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities. 
 Classification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to register, it would have to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming and restrictive and would require a restructuring of our operations, and we would be very constrained in the kind of business we could do as a registered investment company. Further, we would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio composition, and would need to file reports under the Investment Company Act regime. The cost of such compliance would result in us incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required would have a materially adverse impact to conduct our operations. 
 Regulatory changes or actions in one or more countries or jurisdictions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrency in a manner that adversely affects our business, prospects or operations. 
 As cryptocurrency has grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently, with certain governments deeming cryptocurrency illegal, and others allowing their use and trade without restriction. In some jurisdictions, such as in the United States, cryptocurrency is subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Several countries have taken and may continue to take regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict our right to mine, acquire, own, hold, sell or use cryptocurrency or to exchange for local currency. For example, in China it is illegal to accept payment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency for consumer transactions and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of cryptocurrency. 
 Cryptocurrency is viewed differently by different regulatory and standards setting organizations globally as well as in the United States on the federal and state levels. For example, the Financial Action Task Force FATF and the Internal Revenue Service IRS consider a cryptocurrency as currency or an asset or property. Further, the IRS applies general tax principles that apply to property transactions to transactions involving cryptocurrency. 
 37 

If regulatory changes or interpretations require the regulation of cryptocurrency under the securities laws of the United States or elsewhere, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act or similar laws of other jurisdictions and interpretations by the SEC, the CFTC, the IRS, Department of Treasury or other agencies or authorities, we may be required to register and comply with such regulations, including at a state or local level. To the extent that we decide to continue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary expense or burdens to us. Should compliance with these laws become overly burdensome and unprofitable we may decide to cease certain operations and change our business model. 
 Current and future legislation and SEC rule making and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which cryptocurrency is viewed or treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, cryptocurrency may not be excluded from the definition of security by SEC rule making or interpretation requiring registration of all transactions unless another exemption is available, including transacting in cryptocurrency among owners and require registration of trading platforms as exchanges . 
 Due to concerns around resource consumption and associated environmental concerns, particularly as such concerns relate to public utilities companies, various countries, states and cities have implemented, or are considering implementing, moratoriums on Bitcoin mining in their jurisdictions. Such moratoriums would impede Bitcoin mining and/or Bitcoin use more broadly. For example, in November 2022, New York imposed a two-year moratorium on new proof-of-work mining permits at fossil fuel plants in the state. Although we do not mine in New York (we currently mine Bitcoin only in Missouri, Texas and Iowa) it is possible that other states may create similar laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of cryptocurrency under the law. If we fail to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations or be subjected to fines, penalties and other governmental action. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue its business model at all, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrency we plan to hold or expect to acquire for our own account. 
 It may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell, or use cryptocurrency, participate in blockchains or utilize similar cryptocurrency in one or more countries, the ruling of which would adversely affect us. 
 As cryptocurrency has grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrency; certain governments have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the United States, subject to extensive and evolving regulatory requirements. Until recently, little, or no regulatory attention has been directed toward cryptocurrency by U.S. federal and state governments, foreign governments and self-regulatory agencies. As cryptocurrency has grown in popularity and in market size, the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress, and certain U.S. agencies have begun to examine cryptocurrency in more detail. 
 One or more countries, including but not limited to China, which have taken harsh regulatory action in the past, may take regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell, or use cryptocurrency or to exchange for fiat currency. In many nations, particularly in China, it is illegal to accept payment in cryptocurrency for consumer transactions and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of cryptocurrency. Such restrictions may adversely affect us as the large-scale use of cryptocurrency as a means of exchange is presently confined to certain regions globally. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of any Bitcoin that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors. 
 38 

If the trading price of our common shares fails to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, we would face possible delisting, which would result in a limited public market for our common shares and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult for us. 
 Companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market are subject to delisting for, among other things, failure to maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and 5810(c)(3)(A) (the Nasdaq Listing Rules ). 
 Although we believe that we are currently in compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to comply with the Nasdaq Listing Rules for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market in the future. If we cannot comply with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, our common shares would be subject to delisting and would likely trade on the over-the-counter market. If our common shares were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our common shares could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common shares, further limiting the liquidity of our common shares. As a result, the market price of our common shares may be depressed, and you may find it more difficult to sell our common shares. Such delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing. 
 Our business is dependent on a small number of Bitcoin mining equipment suppliers. 
 Our business is dependent upon Bitcoin mining equipment suppliers providing an adequate supply of new generation Bitcoin mining machines at economical prices to customers intending to purchase our hosting and other solutions. The growth in our business is directly related to increased demand for hosting services and Bitcoin which is dependent in large part on the availability of new generation mining machines offered for sale at a price conducive to profitable Bitcoin mining, as well as the trading price of Bitcoin. The market price and availability of new mining machines fluctuates with the price of cryptocurrency and can be volatile. In addition, as more companies seek to enter the mining industry, the demand for machines may outpace supply and create mining machine equipment shortages. There are no assurances that cryptocurrency mining equipment suppliers will be able to keep pace with any surge in demand for mining equipment. We currently do not have an agreement with our suppliers to purchase additional machines, and therefore there is no guarantee that we will be able to purchase machines on terms acceptable to us. We intend to complete one or more financings to provide liquidity to purchase additional machines, at which point we expect to enter into an agreement with one or more machine suppliers in order to purchase additional machines. Further, manufacturing mining machine purchase contracts are not favorable to purchasers and even if we do enter into agreements with our suppliers, we may have little or no recourse in the event a mining machine manufacturer defaults on its mining machine delivery commitments. If we and our customers are not able to obtain a sufficient number of Bitcoin mining machines at favorable prices, our growth expectations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will be negatively impacted. 
 Bitcoin mining machines rely on components and raw materials that may be subject to price fluctuations or shortages, including ASIC chips that have been subject to a significant shortage. 
 In order to build and sustain our self-mining operations we will depend on third parties to provide us with ASIC chips and other critical components for our mining equipment, which may be subject to price fluctuations or shortages. For example, the ASIC chip is the key component of a mining machine as it determines the efficiency of the device. The production of ASIC chips typically requires highly sophisticated silicon wafers, which currently only a small number of fabrication facilities, or wafer foundries, in the world are capable of producing. We believe that the previous microchip shortage that the entire industry experienced lead to price fluctuations and disruption in the supply of key miner components. Specifically, the ASIC chips have recently been subject to a significant price increases and shortages. 
 39 

We do not currently have agreements in place for the supply of ASIC chips. There is a risk that a manufacturer or seller of ASIC chips or other necessary mining equipment may adjust the prices based on fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices or otherwise, and the cost of new machines could become unpredictable and extremely high. As a result, at times, we may be forced to obtain Bitcoin mining machines and other hardware at premium prices, to the extent they are even available. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. 
 Cryptocurrency may be subject to loss, theft, or restriction on access. 
 There is a risk that some or all of any cryptocurrency that we own could be lost or stolen. Cryptocurrency is stored in sites commonly referred to as wallets by holders of cryptocurrency which may be accessed to exchange a holder s cryptocurrency. Access to our Bitcoin could also be restricted by cybercrime (such as a denial of service attack). Cold storage refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Cold storage is generally more secure than hot storage, but is not ideal for quick or regular transactions and we may experience lag time in our ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price of our Bitcoin. We expect to hold all our cryptocurrency in a combination of insured institutional custody services and multi signature cold storage wallets, and maintain secure backups to reduce the risk of malfeasance, but the risk of loss of our Bitcoin cannot be wholly eliminated. Any restrictions on access to our Bitcoin due to cybercrime or other reasons could limit our ability to convert cryptocurrency to cash, potentially resulting in liquidity issues. Currently, we store our Bitcoin in wallets custodied by Bitgo and Coinbase (each, a Custodian and together, the Custodians ). All of our wallets held by Custodians are cold wallets. Such arrangements are governed by each Custodian s terms of service, and we do not have an agreement with either Custodian other than such terms of service. When we decide to sell Bitcoin, we transfer it from our digital wallets held by the applicable Custodian to our trading account wallet, which is held by us. We do not currently have a specific policy for how or when to sell Bitcoin for fiat currency to fund our operations for growth or through what exchange we do so, or whether we should hold our mining rewards for investment purposes. At this time, our Bitcoin are not held for long periods of time and they are generally sold nearly immediately in order to fund our operations. Transfers through Bitgo over a certain size require video conference verification to ensure that the request came from one of our authorized signors, and that we in fact authorized the transfer in question. 
 Hackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure cryptocurrency. As we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks, or other security threats. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our investments and profitability. The loss or destruction of a private key required to access our digital wallets may be irreversible and we may be denied access for all time to our cryptocurrency holdings or the holdings of others held in those compromised wallets. Our loss of access to our private keys or a data loss relating to our digital wallets could adversely affect our investments and assets. 
 Cryptocurrency is controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which they are held, which wallet s public key or address is reflected in the network s public blockchain. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed, or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our cryptocurrency rewards and such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our cryptocurrency could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of Bitcoin that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. 
 40 

Bitcoin is subject to halving, and our Bitcoin mining operations may generate less revenue as a result. 
 At mathematically predetermined intervals, the number of new Bitcoin awarded for solving a block is cut in half, which is referred to as halving. Bitcoin halving occurred in April 2024, at which time the block rewards for Bitcoin halved from 6.25 to 3.125. While we cannot predict the exact date of the next halving, as it is predicated on factors such as the block height and the network hash rate, halving happens every 210,000 blocks, and the next Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in 2028. While Bitcoin prices have historically increased around these halving events, there is no guarantee that the price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining rewards. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the price of Bitcoin does not follow the upcoming or future halving events, the revenue we earn from our Bitcoin mining operations would see a decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 The maximum number of Bitcoins that may be released into circulation is 21 million, and the number of Bitcoin currently in circulation is approximately 19.7 million. As the number of Bitcoin available to be mined narrows, we expect the fees for Bitcoin transactions to increase. Eventually, once the majority of Bitcoin is mined and in circulation, we expect to see revenue from transaction fees to exceed the revenue from mining Bitcoin. Once this occurs, we may need to find additional ways to increase our revenue, which could include entering into other areas within the cryptocurrency industry.
