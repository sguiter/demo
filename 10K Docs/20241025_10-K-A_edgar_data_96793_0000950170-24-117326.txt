 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
 
 Our business is managed by the Company s employees under the direction and oversight of the board of directors. Except for Mr. Thornton and Mr. Stockslager, none of our board members is an employee of the Company. The board limits membership on the audit committee and the executive compensation committee (referred to in this Annual Report as the compensation committee to independent non-management directors. We keep board members informed of our business through discussions with management, materials we provide to them, visits to our offices and facilities, and their participation in board and board committee meetings. 
 The board has adopted charters for the standing board committees (other than the executive committee), resolutions governing the process for identification and nomination of candidates for the board, and the Company s code of ethics, known as the SunLink Health Systems, Inc. Code of Conduct. These documents, together with the Company s Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations, provide the framework for the governance of the Company. Our Code of Conduct is applicable to our directors and our employees, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Members of our board are required to certify compliance with our Code of Conduct. Any amendment to or waiver of our Code of Conduct for any board member, our chief executive officer, our chief financial officer, or any other executive officer as well as our comptroller and any other similar accounting officer will be disclosed on our website, www.sunlinkhealth.com .

A complete copy of the charters of the board committees, the resolutions governing the process for identification and nomination of candidates for the board and the Code of Conduct for employees, as in effect from time-to-time, may be found on the Company s website at www.sunlinkhealth.com . Copies of these materials are also available to shareholders without charge upon written request to the Secretary of the Company. 

Summary of the Corporate Governance Principles 
 
 Board and Leadership Structure 
 
 The Company s Code of Regulations provides for a minimum of six (6) and a maximum of eight (8) directors, as determined by the board from time to time. The Company s Board currently consists of five (5) directors. Although there is currently a vacancy on the Board arising from the resignation of a former director in July 2024 and the Board has previously considered possible candidates to fill such vacancy, the Board currently has not identified a candidate to fill the vacant seat and cannot predict whether it will identify a candidate to fill such seat and the timing thereof or whether it will ultimately determine to recommend to the shareholders an amendment to the Code of Regulations to reduce the size of the Board. 
 
 Our Company is led by Mr. Robert M. Thornton, Jr. who has served as chief executive officer and chairman of the board since 1998. We combine this traditional leadership structure with a board structure in which our non-management directors meet regularly outside of the presence of Mr. Thornton. We believe that this structure currently works best for the Company by providing us with the benefits of a single person setting the tone and having primary responsibility for managing our operations and providing clear leadership. At the same time, by having a board which is composed mainly of independent directors, including former CEOs, individuals with healthcare industry operating experience, and diverse other talents, we believe that we have created a board that is collegial, well versed in board processes and the duties of the committees on which they sit, and well engaged in their responsibilities. The board believes its members have no reticence about forcefully expressing their views while at the same time fully and fairly considering the views of their fellow directors, and that the members of the board have the experience and ability to critically evaluate the performance of our Chairman and CEO in implementing the strategic, as well as day to day, goals of the Company. Although the board periodically evaluates alternative board governance models and refinements to the existing structure, it believes, after assessing the current service of the Company s Chairman and CEO and the current composition of the board, that the current board leadership structure is appropriate for the Company. 
 
 Independence 
 
 The board is required to consist of a majority of independent, non-management directors who meet the criteria for independence required by the NYSE American exchange. Under such rules, a director is independent if he or she does not have a material relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board annually evaluates each board member s independence. 
 
 The board has determined that, as of October 28, 2024, three (3) of the Company s five (5) incumbent directors are independent under these guidelines: Baileys, Burleson, and Ford. Mr. Thornton and Mr. Stockslager, as management directors, also participate in the board s activities and provide valuable insights and advice. Each member of our audit and compensation committees is an independent director both under the general definition for board independence as well as any separate independence criteria for service on the applicable committee whether required by the SEC, the NYSE American exchange or SunLink. Independence requirements for committee service are set forth in the respective committee charters. 
 
 The non-management directors meet periodically in executive session without the management director present. The executive sessions of non-management directors are presided over by the director who is the chairperson of the committee responsible for the issue being discussed. General discussions, such as the review of the Company s overall performance, are presided over by the chairperson or a director elected by a majority of the non-management directors. 
 
 Role of the Board in Risk Oversight 
 
 The business of the Company is managed by the Company s employees under the direction and oversight of the board. Among the oversight activities of the board is the broad oversight of risk. Risk is inherent in virtually every business activity. Accordingly, the board s primary role with respect to risk is to ensure that the Company s management implements appropriate procedures designed to identify and, where possible, quantify and/or mitigate risks. The board administers its risk oversight function both at a board level and through its various committees. Our board committees consider, among other things, risk issues within their areas of responsibility. For example: The audit committee oversees the accounting and financial reporting process, the adequacy of our risk-related internal financial controls, internal audit, the impact of risks on our current financial position, and related compliance matters. The 
 5 

compensation committee oversees the annual performance evaluations of executive management, succession planning, and the evaluation of risks that may be implicated by the Company s compensation structure. 
 
 Director Share Ownership 
 
 SunLink believes that each director should have a personal investment in the Company. Each outside director (or future outside director, as the case may be) is required to own at least one thousand (1,000) common shares of SunLink. Each outside director (or future outside director, as the case may be) must maintain ownership of such number of common shares until such outside director ceases to serve as a member of the board. Each of our current directors has complied with such ownership requirements since at least July 1, 2008. 
 
 Annual Meeting Attendance 
 
 	Although we do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the board at our annual meeting of shareholders, the board encourages all of its members to attend the annual meeting of shareholders. In June 2024, all director nominees and all then directors were personally present at the annual meeting of shareholders. 
 
 Communications by and with Directors 
 
 	In connection with the proper discharge of their duties, our independent non-management directors have access to individual members of management or to other employees of the Company on a confidential basis. Likewise, in connection with the discharge of their duties, non-management directors as authorized by the board or a committee thereof also have access to Company records and files, and our directors may contact other directors without informing Company management of the purpose or even the fact of such contact. 
 
 	Shareholders may communicate with the board, board committees, non-employee directors as a group, and individual directors by submitting their communications in writing to SunLink Health Systems, Inc., 900 Circle 75 Parkway, Suite 690, Atlanta, Georgia 30339 Attention: Corporate Secretary. Any communication should contain (i) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of our common shares; (ii) the name and address, as they appear on our books, of the shareholder sending the communication; and (iii) the number of our common shares that are beneficially owned by such shareholder. 
 
 	Our corporate secretary will forward communications to the intended recipients unless the communication is unduly hostile, threatening, illegal or similarly inappropriate, in which case our corporate secretary has the authority to discard the communication or to take appropriate legal action regarding the communication. Similarly, unsolicited advertisements or invitations to conferences or promotional material, in the discretion of our corporate secretary or her designee, may not be forwarded to the directors. 
 
 Related Party Transactions 
 
 	The Company is subject to a variety of prohibitions on, or approval procedures with respect to, related party transactions. 
 First, the Company is subject to certain of the NYSE American exchange requirements which require shareholder approval of certain related party transactions. Second, the Company s Code of Conduct prohibits related party transactions which could give rise to a conflict of interest including, but not limited to, employment by third parties that do business with the Company; conducting business, not on behalf of the Company, with the Company s vendors, suppliers, and contractors; representing the Company in any transaction where such person representing the Company has a substantial personal interest; disclosure or use of confidential or inside information about the Company for personal gain; competition with the Company in any purchase, sale or ownership of property, property rights or interests; performing services for vendors or competitors of the Company; service on any board of directors or trustees that might conflict with the Company s interests and; the acceptance of any faculty or speaker positions and any honoraria in connection therewith. A related party transaction must be approved by the Company s compliance committee, or, in the case of a member of the board and/or an executive officer, such related party transaction must be approved by the board s audit committee, with such action reported to the Company s independent directors. To assist in identifying related party transactions, each director and executive officer is required, annually, to submit a Conflict-of-Interest Disclosure Statement. We have not adopted formal standards for the approval of related party transactions, but instead the compliance committee or the board reviews these transactions on a case-by-case basis and may approve such transactions that are in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. During the year ended June 30, 2024, Howard E. Turner was a director of the Company. Mr. Turner is senior counsel at the law firm of Smith, Gambrell Russell, LLP. Such law firm provided legal services to the Company in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, at customary rates and continues to provide such services to the Company in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.

DELINQUENT SECTION 16(a) REPORTS 
 Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires directors and certain officers of the Company and owners of more than 10 of the Company s common shares to file an initial ownership report with the Securities and Exchange Commission and subsequent reports reflecting changes in their ownership of the Company s equity securities. The Company believes, based solely on a review of the copies of those reports furnished to the Company during the past year and written representations to it that no other reports were required, that during the period from July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024 all filing requirements under Section 16 have been met. 
 INSIDER TRADING POLICIES 
 SunLink has adopted insider trading policies and procedures governing the purchase, sale, and/or other dispositions of the issuer s securities by directors, officers and employees, or the issuer itself, that it believes are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations, and any listing standards applicable to SunLink. As a smaller reporting company, SunLink will file a copy of such policy as an exhibit to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 and will include the disclosures required to be included in its proxy statement for the first annual meeting for the election of directors after completion of the first full fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 2023. During the quarters ended December 31, 2023 March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024 , none of the Company s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) informed us of the adoption, modification, or termination of a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as those terms are defined in Regulation S-K, Item 408(c).

(1)	 Represents discretionary bonus awarded by the Company s compensation committee in light of its judgment regarding management s performance with respect to management of the Company s finances, results of operations, dispositions of nonperforming assets and application of proceeds thereof, and other factors deemed relevant in the subjective discretion of the compensation committee. With respect to fiscal 2024 and 2023, the compensation committee retained full authority to determine, among other things, the identity of participants to whom any bonuses would be payable (if at all), whether facts and circumstances merited the award of any bonuses, and the amount of bonuses awarded, if any. 
 
 (2)	 The KRUG International Corp. Retirement Plan (the Plan ), the Company s sole defined benefit plan, was frozen and closed to new participants effective February 28, 1997. Mr. Thornton and Mr. Stockslager are the only named executive officers of the Company who are participants in the Plan and were credited with the years of service specified in the table below when the Plan was frozen. The amount reported in column four of the table above represents the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of the named executive officer s accumulated benefit under the Plan from the measurement date used for financial statement reporting purposes for the prior completed fiscal year to the measurement date used for financial statement reporting purposes for the covered fiscal year. Because the Plan was frozen on February 28, 1997, compensation after such date is not used in determining a participant s accrued benefit. The present value of the accumulated benefits for Mr. Thornton and Mr. Stockslager is 30,391 and 85,688, respectively. Mr. Thornton received a monthly benefit of 225 from the Plan during the fiscal year. The present value of accumulated benefits changes as it is determined as a net present value using an interest rate which changes quarterly as determined by the United States Department of Labor. At June 30, 2024, the estimated future monthly benefits to be received by Messrs. Thornton and Stockslager were 225 and 601, respectively.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence. 
 
 Related Party Transactions 
 
 	The Company is subject to a variety of prohibitions on, or approval procedures with respect to, related party transactions. 
 First, the Company is subject to certain of the NYSE American exchange requirements which require shareholder approval of certain related party transactions. Second, the Company s Code of Conduct prohibits related party transactions which could give rise to a conflict of interest including, but not limited to, employment by third parties that do business with the Company; conducting business, not on behalf of the Company, with the Company s vendors, suppliers, and contractors; representing the Company in any transaction where such person representing the Company has a substantial personal interest; disclosure or use of confidential or inside information about the Company for personal gain; competition with the Company in any purchase, sale or ownership of property, property rights or interests; performing services for vendors or competitors of the Company; service on any board of directors or trustees that might conflict with the Company s interests and; the acceptance of any faculty or speaker positions and any honoraria in connection therewith. A related party transaction must be approved by the Company s compliance committee, or, in the case of a member of the board and/or an executive officer, such related party transaction must be approved by the board s audit committee, with such action reported to the Company s independent directors. To assist in identifying related party transactions, each director and executive officer is required, annually, to submit a Conflict-of-Interest Disclosure Statement. We have not adopted formal standards for the approval of related party transactions, but instead the compliance committee or the board reviews these transactions on a case-by-case basis and may approve such transactions that are in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.

All audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by Cherry Bekaert require pre-approval by the audit committee in accordance with pre-approved procedures established by the audit committee.

The procedures require all proposed engagements of the Company s independent registered public accountants for services of any kind to be directed to the Company s Principal Accounting Officer and then submitted for approval to the audit committee prior to the beginning of any services. 
 
 	In fiscal year 2024, 100 of the audit fees, audit-related fees, and tax fees billed by Cherry Bekaert were approved either by the audit committee or its designee. The fees billed by Cherry Bekaert that are shown in the following table for fiscal year 2024 and 2023 were also pre-approved by the audit committee or its designee. The audit committee has considered whether the provision of 
 14 

non-audit services by Cherry Bekaert is compatible with maintaining the independence of such independent registered public accounting firm and believes that the provision of such services is compatible.
