The Company had an accumulated deficit of at September 30, 2024 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company generated a loss from continuing operations, net of tax, of . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company used cash in continuing operations of . At September 30, 2024 , the Company had a cash balance of . Total revenues were and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The Company had a working capital deficit from continuing operations of and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to further implement its business plan, raise capital, and generate revenues. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Cash on hand and cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements through the fiscal period ending December 31, 2024 . In order to accomplish our business plan objectives, the Company will need to increase revenues, raise capital through the issuance of common stock through its line of equity or otherwise, continue its cost reduction efforts, or enter into a strategic merger or acquisition. There can be no assurances that our business plans and actions will be successful, that we will generate anticipated revenues, or that unforeseen circumstances will not require additional funding sources in the future or require an acceleration of plans to conserve liquidity. Future efforts to improve liquidity through the issuance of our common stock may not be successful, or if available, they may not be available on acceptable terms. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The following table summarizes the activity related to the Company s allowance for credit losses:

is related to a frozen Chinese bank account that has previously been included in long-term assets from discontinued operations (see Discontinued Operations below). 

that is currently in a frozen state due to the litigation related to the Company's former CEO. The Company had petitioned the Chinese courts in 2020 to return the funds to PDN; however at that time, the courts determined that they did not have the appropriate time to review PDN's request. Four years have elapsed and there has been no further activity on the case or notification to PDN regarding the bank account and related funds within. The amount is included in the consolidated balance sheets as long-term restricted cash. In fiscal 2025, the Company intends to re-engage its petition to the Chinese courts for the return of its funds. 
 
 All historical operating results for the Company s China operations are included in a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

deferred tax liabilities, as of September 30, 2024 , recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. 
 
 The Company may be subject to potential income tax examinations by federal or state authorities. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. Management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. Tax years that remain open for assessment for federal and state tax purposes include the years ended December 31, 2020 through 2023. 
 
 The Company s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such expense as a component of income tax expense. There were amounts accrued for penalties or interest as of September 30, 2024 .

 Legal Proceedings 
 
 The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, NAPW, Inc., are parties to a proceeding captioned Deborah Bayne, et al. vs. NAPW, Inc. and Professional Diversity Network, Inc., No. 18 -cv- 3591 (E.D.N.Y.), filed on June 20, 2018, and alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and certain provisions of the New York Labor Law. The class is defined as all individuals employed in New York from June 20, 2012 through October 15, 2021 by NAPW and PDN to sell memberships to the women s networking organization known as the National Association of Professional Women and the International Association of Women, excluding corporate officers, shareholders, directors and administrative employees. As it stands, the class currently consists of 164 putative class members and 60 opt-in plaintiffs. 
 
 The complaint alleges that NAPW (and PDN in its capacity as an alleged joint employer) violated similar provisions of the FLSA and the NYLL by (i) failing to pay overtime wages as required by both the FLSA and the NYLL, (ii) failing to provide accurate wage statements under the NYLL, and (iii) willfully violating both of those statutes. The Court, in an order issued on March 25, 2024, granted summary judgment against NAPW on the claims related to willful failure to pay overtime wages. The Court dismissed, without prejudice, claims based on failure to provide accurate wage statements under the NYLL based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court found that questions of fact remain as to whether PDN was a joint employer with NAPW. Damages remain unsettled particularly in light of the Court s dismissal of the Plaintiff s claims related to failure to provide accurate wage statements. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a litigation settlement reserve in the event of an unfavorable outcome in this proceeding. While the Plaintiff seeks damages substantially in excess of this reserve (including unpaid overtime, liquidated damages and penalties), NAPW and PDN continue to adamantly dispute the amount of damages claimed.

 Stock Options 
 
 The fair value of options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The valuation determined by the Black-Scholes pricing model is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate for the expected life at the time of grant, volatility is based on the average long-term implied volatilities of peer companies, the expected life is based on the estimated average of the life of options using the simplified method, and forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant based on certain historical data. The Company utilizes the simplified method to determine the expected life of its options due to insufficient exercise activity during recent years as a basis from which to estimate future exercise patterns. The expected dividend assumption is based on the Company s history and expectation of dividend payouts. 
 
 Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 . The valuation allowance at September 30, 2024 was . The net change in the valuation allowance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was an increase of .

 General and administrative expense: General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 622,000, or 46.0 , to approximately 731,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 1,353,000 the same period in the prior year. The decrease in expenses was predominantly due to reductions of approximately 412,000 of salaries and related benefit charges, 19,000 in insurance costs, 25,000 in accounting and financing costs, 72,000 in legal costs, 26,000 in bad debt costs, 12,000 in travel costs, 8,000 in filing fees costs, and 48,000 in other general and administrative costs.

The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately 102,000 of amortization expense related to Expo Experts intangible assets, for which there were no comparable expenses in the current period, partially offset by amortization expense of approximately 9,000 related to amortization of capitalized technology, as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 163,000, a decrease of approximately 266,000, compared to approximately 429,000 during the same period in the prior year.

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, including cash from operations and net proceeds from the issuances of common stock, if any. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 133,677 compared to cash and cash equivalents of 627,641 at December 31, 2023. We had an accumulated deficit of 101,652,742 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 In the first quarter of 2024, the Company issued 40,217 shares of its common stock to Tumim Stone Capital in connection with its committed equity line program, at a price of approximately 2.36 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of 95,104. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company issued 184,668 shares of its common stock to Tumim Stone Capital in connection with its committed equity line program, at prices between approximately 1.27 to 1.56 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of 239,885. In the third quarter of 2024, there was no common stock issuance to Tumim Stone Capital. 
 
 On June 28, 2024, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Eighty-eight Investment LLC, a Delaware limited liability company wholly owned and controlled by Mr. Xin He, our Chief Executive Officer. This purchase of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 0.495 per share provided aggregate proceeds of 495,000.

On September 26, 2024, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Yu Tian, an individual and a resident of the People s Republic of China, in connection with the purchase by Ms. Tian of 398,671 shares of common stock at a price of approximately 0.301 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of 120,000. 
 
 We continue to focus on our overall profitability by altering our strategies in targeting new clients and reducing operating and overhead expenses. We have continued to generate negative cash flows from operations, and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and this may have an effect on our liquidity and financial position. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to further implement our business plan, raise capital, and generate revenues. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 We are closely monitoring operating costs and capital requirements. Our Management continues to contain and reduce costs, through personnel reductions, replacing and negotiating with certain vendors, and implementing technology to reduce manual time spent on routine operations. If we are still not successful in sufficiently reducing our costs further, we may then need to dispose of our other assets or discontinue business lines. 
 
 Our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, without the need to increase revenues, or raise capital by the issuance of common stock, including through our line of equity or private placements. There can be no assurances that our business plans and actions will be successful, that we will generate anticipated revenues, or that unforeseen circumstances will not require additional funding sources in the future or require an acceleration of plans to conserve liquidity. Future efforts to raise additional funds may not be successful or they may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. 
 
 Our PDN Network sells recruitment services to employers, generally on a 30-to-90-day period or a one-year contract basis. This revenue is also deferred and recognized over the period of the contract. Our payment terms for PDN Network customers range from 30 to 90 days. We consider the difference between the payment terms and payment receipts a result of transit time for invoice and payment processing and to date have not experienced any liquidity issues as a result of the payments extending past the specified terms. Our NAPW Network collects membership fees generally at the commencement of the membership term or at renewal periods thereafter. The memberships we sell are for one year and we defer recognition of the revenue from membership sales and renewals and recognize it ratably over the twelve-month period. We also offer monthly membership for NAPW for which we collect a fee on a monthly basis. RemoteMore generates revenue by providing contracted programmers to assist customers with their software solutions through customized software development. Customers are charged for the period the work is performed and payment terms are typically net 10 days.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance that provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by financial analysts and others to measure operating performance. Furthermore, management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure may provide investors with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods as they are expected to be reflective of our core ongoing business. However, while we consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure of operating performance, Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Further, Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, may not be comparable to EBITDA, or similarly titled measures, as defined by other companies. 
 
 The following non-GAAP financial information in the tables that follow are reconciled to comparable information presented using GAAP, derived by adjusting amounts determined in accordance with GAAP for certain items presented in the accompanying selected operating statement data. 
 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure reported in our consolidated financial statements, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to exercise considerable judgment with respect to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, our recognition of revenues and expenses, and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 We base our estimates on our historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry, current and expected economic conditions, the attributes of our products, the regulatory environment, and in certain cases, the results of outside appraisals. We periodically re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications are necessary. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
 
 While we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies, we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results could differ from such estimates. 
 
 While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 Our accounts receivable consists principally of uncollateralized amounts billed to customers. These receivables are generally due within 30 to 90 days of the period in which the corresponding sales occur and do not bear interest. They are recorded at net realizable value less an allowance for credit losses and are classified as account receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 We adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This accounting standard requires companies to measure expected credit losses on financial instruments based on the total estimated amount to be collected over the lifetime of the instrument. Prior to the adoption of this accounting standard, we recorded incurred loss reserves against receivable balances based on current and historical information. 
 
 We consider both current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions when evaluating expected credit losses for uncollectible receivable balances. In our determination of the allowance for credit losses, we pool receivables by days outstanding and apply an expected credit loss percentage to each pool. The expected credit loss percentage is determined using historical loss data adjusted for current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Current conditions considered include predefined aging criteria, as well as specified events that indicate the balance due is not collectible. Reasonable and supportable forecasts used in determining the probability of future collection consider publicly available macroeconomic data and whether future credit losses are expected to differ from historical losses. 
 
 We are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that would require an allowance for credit losses in accordance with this accounting standard. 
 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 
 The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives should be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. 
 
 Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis (December 31 for the Company) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company considers its market capitalization and the carrying value of its assets and liabilities, including goodwill, when performing its goodwill impairment test. 
 
 When conducting its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company initially performs a qualitative evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If it is determined by a qualitative evaluation that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the Company then compares the fair value of the Company s reporting unit to its carrying or book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will measure any goodwill impairment losses as the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

Table of Contents 

Capitalized Technology Costs 
 
 We account for capitalized technology costs in accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software ASC 350-40 ). In accordance with ASC 350-40, we capitalize certain external and internal computer software costs incurred during the application development stage. The application development stage generally includes software design and configuration, coding, testing and installation activities. Training and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, while upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if it is probable that such expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software assets on a straight-line basis, generally not exceeding three years. 
 
 Business Combinations 
 
 ASC 805, Business Combinations ASC 805 ), applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations to all acquisitions where the acquirer gains a controlling interest, regardless of whether consideration was exchanged. ASC 805 establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer a) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. Accounting for acquisitions requires the Company to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 Our principal sources of revenue are recruitment revenue, consumer marketing and consumer advertising revenue, event revenues from career fairs, membership subscription fees, and contracted software development. Recruitment revenue includes revenue recognized from direct sales to customers for recruitment services and events, as well as revenue from our direct ecommerce sales. Revenues from recruitment services are recognized when the services are performed, evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. Our recruitment revenue is derived from agreements through single and multiple job postings, recruitment media, talent recruitment communities, basic and premier corporate memberships, hiring campaign marketing and advertising, e-newsletter marketing and research and outreach services. 
 
 Consumer marketing and consumer advertising revenue is recognized either based upon a fixed fee for revenue sharing agreements in which payment is required at the time of posting or billed based upon the number of impressions (the number of times an advertisement is displayed) recorded on the websites as specified in the customer agreement. 
 
 Revenue generated from NAPW Network membership subscriptions is recognized ratably over the 12-month membership period, although members pay their annual fees at the commencement of the membership period. We also offer a monthly membership for which we collect fees on a monthly basis and we recognize revenue in the same month as the fees are collected. Revenue from related membership services is derived from fees for development and set-up of a member s personal on-line profile and/or press release announcements. Fees related to these services are recognized as revenue at the time the on-line profile is complete and press release is distributed. 
 
 Revenues generated from RemoteMore consist of contracts entered into to provide customers with software solutions and are recognized in the month work is performed.

Revenue Concentration 
 
 We are in an alliance with another company to build, host, and manage some of our job boards and website. This alliance member also sells two of our recruitment services products and bills customers, collects fees, and provides customer services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded approximately 5 and 9 of our recruitment services revenue from this alliance sales relationship. We are currently in the process of transitioning the management of these job boards and website operations in-house. 
 
 Lease Obligations 
 
 We lease office space under a non-cancelable operating lease that expires in September 2027. Our facility lease provides for periodic rent increases and contain escalation clauses and renewal options. Our lease terms include options to extend the lease. 
 
 We recognize operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. Lease costs are primarily recorded within SG A expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss. 
 
 We determine if a contract contains a lease at lease inception. If the borrowing rate implicit in the lease is not determinable, we use its incremental borrowing rate ("IBR") based on information available at lease commencement including prevailing financial market conditions to determine the present value of future lease payments. We have elected the option to combine lease and non-lease components as a single component for our entire population of lease assets. 
 
 Operating lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease payments, initial direct costs, and lease incentives. We have elected not to apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases of 12 months or less and instead recognizes lease payments as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease agreement does not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Leased assets are presented net of accumulated amortization. 
 
 Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease, such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the ROU assets or liabilities; instead, these are expensed as incurred and recorded as variable lease expense. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. This update will be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented in the financial statements. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 primarily enhances and expands both the annual income tax rate reconciliation disclosure and the annual income taxes paid disclosure. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. 
 
 The company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of these standards on our disclosures. 
 
 ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Not applicable. 
 
 ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our third quarter of fiscal 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
 
 ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, NAPW, Inc., are parties to a proceeding captioned Deborah Bayne, et al. vs. NAPW, Inc. and Professional Diversity Network, Inc., No. 18-cv-3591 (E.D.N.Y.), filed on June 20, 2018, and alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and certain provisions of the New York Labor Law. The class is defined as all individuals employed in New York from June 20, 2012 through October 15, 2021 by NAPW and PDN to sell memberships to the women s networking organization known as the National Association of Professional Women and the International Association of Women, excluding corporate officers, shareholders, directors and administrative employees. As it stands, the class currently consists of 164 putative class members and 60 opt-in plaintiffs. 
 
 The complaint alleges that NAPW (and PDN in its capacity as an alleged joint employer) violated similar provisions of the FLSA and the NYLL by (i) failing to pay overtime wages as required by both the FLSA and the NYLL, (ii) failing to provide accurate wage statements under the NYLL, and (iii) willfully violating both of those statutes. The Court, in an order issued on March 25, 2024, granted summary judgment against NAPW on the claims related to willful failure to pay overtime wages. The Court dismissed, without prejudice, claims based on failure to provide accurate wage statements under the NYLL based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court found that questions of fact remain as to whether PDN was a joint employer with NAPW. Damages remain unsettled particularly in light of the Court s dismissal of the Plaintiff s claims related to failure to provide accurate wage statements. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a 450,000 litigation settlement reserve in the event of an unfavorable outcome in this proceeding. While the Plaintiff seeks damages substantially in excess of this reserve (including unpaid overtime, liquidated damages and penalties), NAPW and PDN continue to adamantly dispute the amount of damages claimed. 
 
 General Legal Matters 
 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. While the Company believes that such matters are currently not material, there can be no assurance that matters arising in the ordinary course of business for which the Company is, or could be, involved in litigation, will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS 
 
 In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 
 Except as updated below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 If we are unable to regain and maintain compliance with Nasdaq continued listing standards, including maintenance of at least 2.5 million of stockholders equity and maintenance of a 1.00 minimum bid price, our common stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market. 
 
 As we have previously disclosed, on May 21, 2024, we received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq notifying us that we were not in compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market because we reported stockholders equity of less than 2.5 million in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024, and we did not meet the alternative tests for market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations. In accordance with the notice, within 45 days of receiving the letter, we submitted a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders equity standard. Based on the Nasdaq staff s review of our plan, Nasdaq granted us an extension of 180 calendar days from the date of the notification letter to regain compliance (i.e., until November 17, 2024). If we regain compliance by November 17, 2024, Nasdaq will continue to monitor our ongoing compliance and, if at the time our next period report is filed with the SEC we do not evidence continued compliance, our common stock may be subject to delisting. In order to regain compliance, we will need to raise capital through the sale of equity securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance. 
 
 On June 27, 2024, we received a separate notice that we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market because for the prior 30 consecutive trading days, the closing bid price of our common stock was below the 1.00 per share minimum required. Nasdaq listing rules provide for a compliance period of 180 calendar days (i.e., until December 24, 2024) in which to regain compliance. We will regain compliance if the closing bid price of our common stock is 1.00 per share or higher for a minimum period of ten consecutive business days during this compliance period. In the event we do not regain compliance, we may be eligible for additional time. To qualify, we will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during a second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split if necessary. If we meet these requirements, Nasdaq will inform us that we have been granted an additional 180 calendar days. However, if it appears to the staff of Nasdaq that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we are otherwise not eligible, Nasdaq will provide notice that our securities will be subject to delisting. 
 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with these listing requirements and maintain our Nasdaq listing in the future. In the event we are unable to regain and maintain compliance with Nasdaq continued listing standards and our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, it could likely lead to a number of negative implications, including an adverse effect on the price of our common stock, reduced liquidity in our common stock, the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws and greater difficulty in obtaining financing including through public or private sales of equity securities. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities. In the event of a delisting, we would take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing standards, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements.
