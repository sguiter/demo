The Valuation Designee s valuation is not based on long-term work-out value, immediate liquidation value, nor incremental value for potential changes that may take place in the future. The values assigned to investments are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized, as these amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot reasonably be determined until the individual investments are actually liquidated. Such circumstances may include macroeconomic, geopolitical and other events and conditions that may significantly impact the profitability or viability of businesses in which the Company is invested, and therefore may significantly impact the return on the Company s investments. The foregoing policies apply to all investments, including any in companies and groups of affiliated companies aggregating more than of the Company s assets. Fair valuations of investments in each asset class are determined using one or more methodologies including market quotations, the market approach, income approach, or, in the case of recent investments, the cost approach, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Such information may include observed multiples of earnings and/or revenues at which transactions in securities of comparable companies occur, with appropriate adjustments for differences in company size, operations or other factors affecting comparability. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present value amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. The discount rates used for such analyses reflect market yields for comparable investments, considering such factors as relative credit quality, capital structure, and other factors. In following these approaches, the types of factors that may be taken into account also include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, merger and acquisition comparables, comparable costs of capital, the principal market in which the investment trades and enterprise values, among other factors. Investments may be categorized based on the types of inputs used in valuing such investments. The level in the GAAP valuation hierarchy in which an investment falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation of the investment in its entirety. Transfers between levels are recognized as of the beginning of the reporting period.

These risks include, among other things, revaluation of currencies, less reliable information about issuers, different transaction clearance and settlement practices, and potential future adverse political and economic developments. Moreover, investments in foreign companies and securities of foreign governments and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies and the U.S. Government.

of the Company s total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) and payable quarterly in arrears. For the period from the date the Company first issues shares of common stock to one or more investors (other than the Advisor and its affiliates) through the end of the first calendar quarter, no management fee was payable. Subsequently, the management fee is calculated based on the value of the Company s total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. The management fees for any partial quarter are appropriately prorated. Incentive fee is only incurred to the extent the Company s cumulative total return (after incentive fee) exceeds a annual rate on daily weighted-average unreturned capital contributions. Subject to that limitation, incentive fee is calculated on net investment income (before incentive fee) and net realized gains (net of any unrealized depreciation) at a rate of . Incentive fee is computed as the difference between incentive fee earned and incentive fee paid, subject to the total return hurdle, on a cumulative basis, and is payable quarterly in arrears. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cumulative performance exceeded the total return hurdle, and as such the incentive fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were and respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the Company's cumulative performance exceeded the total return hurdle, and as such the incentive fees for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were and , respectively. There were incentive fees on capital gains accrued on a liquidation basis (but not payable) under GAAP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. There can be no assurance that unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation will be realized in the future, or that any accrued capital gains incentive fee will become payable under the Investment Management Agreement. Incentive fee amounts on capital gains actually paid by the Company will specifically exclude consideration of unrealized capital appreciation, consistent with requirements under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act and the Investment Management Agreement. The Company bears all expenses incurred in connection with its business, including fees and expenses of outside contracted services, such as custodian, administrative, legal, audit and tax preparation fees, costs of valuing investments, insurance costs, brokers and finders fees relating to investments, and any other transaction costs associated with the purchase and sale of investments.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Some of the statements in this report (including in the following discussion) constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which relate to future events or the future performance or financial condition of BlackRock Direct Lending Corp. (the Company, we, us or our ). The forward-looking statements contained in this report involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including statements concerning: 
 our, or our portfolio companies , future business, operations, operating results or prospects; 

the return or impact of current and future investments; 

the impact of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our business; 

the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our business; 

the impact of changes in laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our portfolio companies; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 

the financial condition of and ability of our current and prospective portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

our expected financings and investments; 

the adequacy of our financing resources and working capital; 

the ability of our investment advisor to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; 

the timing, form and amount of any dividend distributions; and 

our ability to maintain our qualification as a RIC and as a business development company. 

We use words such as anticipate, believe, expect, intend, will, should, could, may, plan and similar words to identify forward-looking statements. The forward looking statements contained in this quarterly report involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors set forth as Risk Factors in this report. 
 We have based the forward-looking statements included in this report on information available to us on the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form 10, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. 
 Overview 

The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a RIC, the Company will not be taxed on its income to the extent that it distributes such income each year and satisfies other applicable income tax requirements. 
 To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our stockholders generally at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each 
 40 

year. Pursuant to this election, we generally will not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders provided that we satisfy those requirements. 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets, including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies, public U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Act, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"), public domestic operating companies having a market capitalization of less than 250.0 million, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We are also permitted to make certain follow-on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but that no longer meet the definition. As of September 30, 2024, 88.7 of our total assets were invested in qualifying assets. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest on the debt we hold. We also generate revenue from dividends on our equity interests, capital gains on the disposition of investments, and certain lease, fee, and other income. Our investments in fixed income instruments generally have an expected maturity of three to five years, although we have no lower or upper constraint on maturity. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semi-annually. Payments of principal of our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments and preferred stock investments may defer payments of cash interest or dividends or PIK. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, origination, structuring or due diligence fees, end-of-term or exit fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance, consulting fees and other investment related income. 
 Expenses 
 The Company is responsible for paying the compensation of the Advisor. In addition, the Company is generally responsible for all operating expenses of the Company, and shall pay, and shall reimburse the Advisor or the Administrator and their respective affiliates for, all fees, costs, expenses, liabilities and obligations of the Company relating or attributable to: 
 our organization; 

calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); 

interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; 

the base management fee and any incentive fee; 

dividends and distributions on our shares of common stock; 

administration fees payable under the administration agreement; 

fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments; 

transfer agent and custodial fees; 

registration fees; 

taxes; 

director fees and expenses; 

costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the SEC; 

costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders, including printing costs; 

our fidelity bond; 

directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; 

indemnification payments; 

41 

direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit and legal costs; and 

all other expenses reasonably incurred by us and the Administrator in connection with administering our business, such as the allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement, including rent and other allocable portions of the cost of certain of our officers and their respective staffs. 

The investment management agreement provides that the base management fee be calculated at an annual rate of 0.90 of our total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) on the last day of each preceding calendar quarter and is payable quarterly in arrears. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, total assets is determined without deduction for any borrowings or other liabilities. No base management fee is payable for the period from the date of the initial drawdown purchase through the end of the first calendar quarter after the initial drawdown purchase. Subsequently, the base management fee is calculated based on the value of our total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. The base management fee for any partial quarter is appropriately prorated. 
 Additionally, the investment management agreement provides that the Advisor or its affiliates may be entitled to incentive fee under certain circumstances. According to the terms of such agreement, the incentive fee equals the sum of (i) 12.5 of all net investment income and (ii) 12.5 of all net realized capital gains (net of any net unrealized capital depreciation) less net investment income incentive fee and capital gains incentive fee previously paid. However, incentive fee will only be paid to the extent the cumulative total return of the Company after incentive fee and including such payment would equal or exceed a 6 annual return on daily weighted-average contributed common equity. The determination of incentive fee is subject to limitations under the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act. 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the financial statements. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to our financial statements. 
 Valuation of portfolio investments 
 Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 (the Rule under the 1940 Act, the Board of Directors designated the Advisor as the Company s valuation designee (the Valuation Designee to perform certain fair value functions, including performing fair value determinations and has approved policies and procedures adopted by the Advisor to seek to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Rules. 
 We value our portfolio investments at fair value based upon the principles and methods of valuation set forth in policies and procedures reviewed and approved by a committee established by the Valuation Designee (the "Valuation Committee") and approved by the Board of Directors. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset that (i) are independent of us, (ii) are knowledgeable, having a reasonable understanding about the asset based on all available information (including information that might be obtained through due diligence efforts that are usual and customary), (iii) are able to transact for the asset, and (iv) are willing to transact for the asset or liability (that is, they are motivated but not forced or otherwise compelled to do so). 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations unless the quotations are deemed not to represent fair value. We generally obtain market quotations from recognized exchanges, market quotation systems, independent pricing services or one or more broker-dealers or market makers. However, short term debt investments with original maturities of generally three months or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available, which is the case for many of our investments, or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, are valued at fair value using a consistently applied valuation process in accordance with our documented valuation policies and procedures reviewed and approved by the Valuation Committee. Due to the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events may have differing impacts on the market quotations used to value some of our investments than on the fair values of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available. Market quotations may be deemed not to represent fair value in certain circumstances where we believe that facts and circumstances applicable to an issuer, a seller or purchaser, or the market for a particular security cause current market quotations to not reflect the fair value of the security. Examples of these events could include 
 42 

cases where a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale, where there is a forced sale by a distressed seller, where market quotations vary substantially among market makers, or where there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread. 
 The valuation process approved by the Valuation Designee with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value is as follows: 
 The investment professionals of the Valuation Designee provide recent portfolio company financial statements and other reporting materials to independent valuation firms approved by Valuation Committee. 

Such firms evaluate this information along with relevant observable market data to conduct independent appraisals each quarter, and their preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with senior management of the Valuation Designee. 

The fair value of smaller investments comprising in the aggregate less than 5 of our total capitalization may be determined by the Valuation Designee in good faith in accordance with our valuation policy without the employment of an independent valuation firm. 

The Valuation Designee determines the fair value of the remainder of investments in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Valuation Committee and the respective independent valuation firms. 

Those investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued utilizing one or more methodologies, including the market approach, the income approach, or in the case of recent investments, the cost approach, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that the Valuation Designee may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments include, as relevant and among other factors: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, merger and acquisition comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values. 
 When valuing all of our investments, we strive to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. 
 Our investments may be categorized based on the types of inputs used in their valuation. The level in the GAAP valuation hierarchy in which an investment falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation of the investment in its entirety. Investments are classified by GAAP into the three broad levels as follows: 
 Level 1 Investments valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. 
 Level 2 Investments valued using other unadjusted observable market inputs, e.g. quoted prices in markets that are not active or quotes for comparable instruments. 
 Level 3 Investments that are valued using quotes and other observable market data to the extent available, but which also take into consideration one or more unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation taken as a whole. 
 As of September 30, 2024, none of our investments were categorized as Level 1, 2.2 were categorized as Level 2 and 97.8 were Level 3 investments valued based on valuations by independent third-party sources. 
 As of December 31, 2023, none of our investments were categorized as Level 1, 3.7 were categorized as Level 2 and 96.3 were Level 3 investments valued based on valuations by independent third-party sources. 
 Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on the financial statements.

Revenue recognition 
 Interest and dividend income, including income paid in kind, is recorded on an accrual basis, when such amounts are considered collectible. Origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees, including original issue discounts, earned with respect to capital commitments are generally amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment, as are end-of-term or exit fees receivable upon repayment of a debt investment. Other fees, including certain amendment fees, prepayment fees and commitment fees on broken deals, are recognized as earned. Prepayment fees and similar income due upon the early repayment of a loan or debt security are recognized when earned and are included in interest income. 
 Certain of our debt investments are purchased at a discount to par as a result of the underlying credit risks and financial results of the issuer, as well as general market factors that influence the financial markets as a whole. Discounts on the acquisition of corporate bonds are generally amortized using the effective-interest or constant-yield method assuming there are no questions as to collectability. When principal payments on a loan are received in an amount in excess of the loan s amortized cost, the excess principal payments are recorded as interest income. 
 Debt investments are generally placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal or interest will not be collected according to the contractual terms. When a debt investment is placed on non-accrual status, accrued and unpaid interest (including any accrued PIK interest) is generally reversed, and discount accretion or premium amortization is discontinued. The Company does not reverse previously capitalized PIK income. Payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the Company s judgment regarding collectability of the outstanding principal and interest. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid or, in the Company s judgement, the repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected. The Company may opt not to place a distressed debt investment on non-accrual status if principal and interest are secured through sufficient collateral value and are in the process of collection through legal actions or other efforts that are expected to result in repayment of principal and interest. 
 Net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
 We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Realized gains and losses are computed using the specific identification method. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.

 Income tax expense, including excise tax 
 The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, the Company must, among other things, timely distribute to its stockholders generally at least 90 of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. The Company has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4 excise tax on such income. Any excise tax expense is incurred at year end as such amounts are known. No excise tax was incurred nor paid in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Excise tax of 1,809 was incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

On June 18, 2021, the Company entered into the Capital Call Facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation as administrative agent, lead arranger and as a lender, secured by the unfunded equity commitments of the Company s investors. On June 15, 2023, the Capital Call Facility was amended to extend its maturity from June 16, 2023 to June 16, 2024 and to reduce the capacity from 75.0 million to 40.0 million. Prior to the amendment, interest on the Capital Call Facility accrued at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.95 per annum, or, for short-term draws, a rate equal to the Prime Rate plus 0.95 , the Federal Funds Rate plus 1.45 , or one-month LIBOR plus 1.95 , whichever was highest. Effective June 16, 2023, interest on the Capital Call Facility accrues at a rate equal to SOFR plus 2.25 per annum, or, for short-term draws, a rate equal to the Prime Rate plus 1.25 , or the Federal Funds Rate plus 1.45 , or one-month SOFR plus 2.25 , whichever is highest. Commitment fees on the Capital Call Facility accrue at a rate of 0.25 per annum when the undrawn amount of the commitment is less than 50 , and 0.30 per annum when the unused portion is equal to or greater than 50 . The Capital Call Facility was fully paid off and terminated upon its maturity on June 16, 2024. 
 Total debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 included unsecured promissory notes with a principal amount of 110,000, at a rate of 12 per annum, and a maturity date of December 31, 2050. 
 Under Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, prior to March 23, 2018, a BDC was generally not permitted to issue senior securities unless after giving effect thereto the BDC met a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to total senior securities, which includes all borrowings of the BDC, of at least 200 . On March 23, 2018, the Small Business 
 47 

Credit Availability Act SBCAA was signed into law, which among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to BDCs from 200 to 150 so long as the BDC meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a BDC to have a ratio of total outstanding indebtedness to common equity of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200 asset coverage requirement. The Company does not currently intend to seek approval for the modified asset coverage ratio election set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s asset coverage ratio was 240,440 . 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.7 million, consisting of net investment income (net of non-cash income and expenses) of approximately 16.7 million, offset by the settlement of acquisitions of investments (net of dispositions) of (7.0) million.

 At September 30, 2024 we had 17.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 Contractual obligations 
 We have entered into several contracts under which we have future commitments. Pursuant to an investment management agreement, the Advisor manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Payments under the investment management agreement are equal to a percentage of the value of our total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) and an incentive fee, plus reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by the Advisor. Under our administration agreement, the Administrator provides us with administrative services, facilities and personnel. Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations to us, and may include rent and our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our officers and their respective staffs. We are responsible for reimbursing the Advisor for due diligence and negotiation expenses, fees and expenses of custodians, administrators, transfer and distribution agents, counsel and directors, insurance, filings and registrations, proxy expenses, expenses of communications to investors, compliance expenses, interest, taxes, portfolio transaction expenses, costs of responding to regulatory inquiries and reporting to regulatory authorities, costs and expenses of preparing and maintaining our books and records, indemnification, litigation and other extraordinary expenses and such other expenses as are approved by the directors as being reasonably related to our organization, offering, capitalization, operation or administration and any portfolio investments, as applicable. The Advisor is not responsible for any of the foregoing expenses and such services are not investment advisory services under the 1940 Act. The Company may terminate each of the Investment Management Agreement and Administration Agreement without penalty upon not less than 60 days written notice to the other party and the Advisor and the Administrator may terminate the Investment Management Agreement or Administration Agreement, as applicable, without penalty upon not less than 120 days written notice to the other party. 
 Distributions 
 Our quarterly dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are declared considering our estimate of annual taxable income available for distribution to stockholders and the amount of taxable income carried over from the prior year for distribution in the current year. We do not have a policy to pay distributions at a specific level and expect to continue to distribute substantially all of our taxable income. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level. 
 The following tables summarize dividends declared for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Tax characteristics of any distributions are reported to stockholders on Form 1099-DIV or Form 1042-S after the end of the calendar year.

We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to maintain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 
 98 of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year; 

98.2 of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year; and 

certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. 

We may, at our discretion, carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a 4 excise tax on this income. If we choose to do so, all other things being equal, this would increase expenses and reduce the amounts available to be distributed to our stockholders. We will accrue excise tax on estimated taxable income as required. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. 
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time. Also, we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in our existing and future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of favorable RIC tax treatment. In addition, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC and may be subject to an excise tax. 
 In order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs, we have the ability to pay a large portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock instead of in cash. As long as a sufficient portion of such dividend is paid in cash (which portion can generally be as low as 20 and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution would be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 Related Parties 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 The Company has entered into an investment management agreement with the Advisor. 

The Administrator provides us with administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Administrator may be reimbursed by us for expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our officers and the Administrator s administrative staff and providing, at our request and on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. The Administrator is an affiliate of the Advisor. 

We have entered into a royalty-free license agreement with BlackRock and the Advisor, pursuant to which each of BlackRock and the Advisor has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name "BlackRock". 

The Advisor and its affiliates, employees and associates currently do and in the future may manage other funds and accounts. The Advisor and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds or accounts. Accordingly, conflicts may arise regarding the allocation of investments or opportunities among us and those accounts. In general, the Advisor will allocate investment opportunities pro rata among us and the other funds and accounts (assuming the investment satisfies the objectives of each) based on the amount of committed capital each then has available. The allocation of certain investment opportunities in private placements is subject to independent director approval pursuant to the terms of the co-investment exemptive 
 49 

order applicable to us. In certain cases, investment opportunities may be made other than on a pro rata basis. For example, we may desire to retain an asset at the same time that one or more other funds or accounts desire to sell it or we may not have additional capital to invest at a time the other funds or accounts do. If the Advisor is unable to manage our investments effectively, we may be unable to achieve our investment objective. In addition, the Advisor may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and certain other entities that could impact our investment returns. While our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted under the 1940 Act, we have received an exemptive order from the SEC permitting certain affiliated investments subject to certain conditions. As a result, we may face conflict of interests and investments made pursuant to the exemptive order conditions which could in certain circumstances affect adversely the price paid or received by us or the availability or size of the position purchased or sold by us. 
 Recent Developments 
 On November 6, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend in the amount of 6,667,404, payable on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2024, 97.6 of debt investments in our portfolio bore interest based on floating rates, such as SOFR, EURIBOR, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. The interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months. At September 30, 2024, the percentage of floating rate debt investments in our portfolio that were subject to an interest rate floor was 95.0 . Floating rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months only if the index exceeds the floor. 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. We assess our portfolio companies periodically to determine whether such companies will be able to continue making interest payments in the event that interest rates increase. There can be no assurances that the portfolio companies will be able to meet their contractual obligations at any or all levels of increases in interest rates. 
 Based on our Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income (excluding the related incentive fee impact) of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments and the fact that our assets and liabilities may not have the same base rate period as assumed in this table) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the period covered by this report, we, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on our evaluation, our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of material information about us required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, are based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has not been any change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
