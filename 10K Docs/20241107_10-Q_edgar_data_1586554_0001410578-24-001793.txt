Goodwill The Company tests for impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. In assessing whether goodwill is impaired, the Company utilizes the two-step process as prescribed by ASC 350. The first step of this test compares the fair value of the reporting unit, determined based upon discounted estimated future cash flows, to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and step two of the goodwill impairment test would need to be performed to measure the amount of an impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss in the amount of the excess is recognized and charged to the statement of operations.

Additionally, CannaKorp is actively seeking a joint venture partner and/ or a licensor to assist in both marketing and launching the Wisp Vaporizer and Wisp Pods in both the US and Canadian legal cannabis or hemp markets. Results of Operations The Company has not generated significant revenue to date and consequently, its operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. Analysis on the performance of the Company is as follows: Balance sheet As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 Cash and Restricted Cash On September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 1,284,480 (excluding restricted cash of 8,520) compared to 736,323 (excluding restricted cash of 8,696) as of December 31, 2023. The increase is because the company revenue generating activity now included the newly acquired JVCo. The change in restricted cash is due to foreign exchange conversion of balances in Canadian Dollars into United States Dollar.

 Expenses Our expenses are classified primarily into advisory and consultancy fees, management fees, salaries and wages, legal and professional fees, and depreciation expense.
