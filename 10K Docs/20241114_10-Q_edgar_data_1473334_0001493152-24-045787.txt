TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR
THE NINE AND THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 (UNAUDITED) 

which was incorporated in Malaysia on July 26, 2019. The purpose
of this acquisition was to market and sell high-end physiotherapeutic jade mats in Malaysia. 

On
January 7, 2020, the Company transferred its entire interest in Bright Swallow to Y-Tone (Worldwide) Limited, an unrelated third party,
for cash consideration of , pursuant to a formal agreement entered into on January 7, 2020. The Company received the payment
on May 11, 2020. 

On
October 14, 2020, the Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Institute invalidated licenses for offshore companies under an Order of Repeal
of Legal Regime of the Offshore Services by Macao Special Administrative Region. Nova Macao then entered into a de-registration process
and its business was taken over by Nova HK. Nova Macao completed the de-registration and liquidation process in January 2021. 

On
November 5, 2020, Nova LifeStyle acquired Nova HK at cost of which was incorporated in Hong Kong on November 6, 2019. This company
had minimal operations other than to take over the business of Nova Macao. On February 15, 2022, the Company transferred its entire assets
and business in Nova HK to Nova Malaysia, a subsidiary of the Company. In February 2023, Nova HK was completed the process of de-registration
and liquidation. 

The
 Company and Nova collectively refer to Nova LifeStyle, the U.S. parent, and its subsidiaries, Nova Furniture,
Nova Samoa, Diamond Bar, i Design, Nova HK and Nova Malaysia. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and following GAAP in
the U.S. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue in operation one year after the date these financial
statements are issued and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
The Company incurred a net loss of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively;
and million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The working capital deficit was million as of September 30, 2024, a
decrease of million from net working capital of as of December 31, 2023. The accumulated deficit of
the Company was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Net cash balance decreased to 
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Continuation as a going
concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities
arising from normal business operations when they come due and ultimately upon its ability to achieve profitable operations. The outcome
of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and raises substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue
as a going concern. 

The
Company has faced ongoing losses from operations, and significant cash outflows from cash used in operating activities in past years.
The Company lacks assurance regarding its ability to achieve profitability or secure essential financing for its operations. Considering
these principal conditions, the Company s management has determined that it is probable the Company might encounter challenges
in meeting its obligations within one year after the issuance of financial statements, primarily due to insufficient cash flow. Therefore,
the Company must assess the probability that its plans will effectively alleviate the substantial doubt. 

The
Company management has the following plans to alleviate the substantial doubt: the Company will participate in four major U.S. furniture
fairs every year to seek new customers to increase the Company s sales. To augment diversified revenue streams, the Company s
subsidiary Nova Malaysia has engaged in the development of an innovative home decoration design IT software systems. Besides, in the
second half of this year, the Company plans to raise money from the market to increase cash flow and investment capital in addition to
the private placement during the second quarter. 

reverse stock split of the Company s authorized shares of common stock, par value , accompanied by
a corresponding decrease in the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the Reverse Stock Split ),
shall be effected. All references to shares and per share data have been retroactively restated to reflect such split. 

per

and , respectively; and and for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are primarily related to quarter-to-date income generated from domestic and foreign
operation. 

Income
taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences
in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end
based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

The
Company follows ASC Topic 740, which prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement
of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on recognition of income tax assets
and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated
with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. 

Under
the provisions of ASC Topic 740, when tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination
by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position
that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which,
based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination,
including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more
than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated
with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits
in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon
examination. 

Nova
Lifestyle, Inc. and Diamond Bar are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. Nova Furniture BVI was incorporated in the BVI and
Nova Samoa was incorporated in Samoa. There is no income tax for companies domiciled in the BVI and Samoa. Accordingly, the Company s
condensed consolidated financial statements do not present any income tax provisions related to the BVI and Samoa tax jurisdictions where
Nova Furniture BVI and Nova Samoa are domiciled. Nova Malaysia is incorporated in Malaysia and is subject to Malaysia income taxes at
the statutory rate of . 

The
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings such as global intangible
low-taxed income GILTI under IRC Section 951A, which is effective for the Company for tax years beginning after January
1, 2018. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has calculated its best estimate of the impact of the GILTI in its
income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing. 

On
December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal
Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from to effective for tax years beginning
after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial system,
and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. 

On
March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act contains numerous income tax provisions,
such as relaxing limitations on the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating losses (NOLs) arising in taxable years beginning
after December 31, 2017. 

Beginning
in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year
incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years. While it is possible that Congress may defer, modify,
or repeal this provision, potentially with retroactive effect, we have no assurance that this provision will be deferred, modified, or
repealed. Furthermore, in anticipation of the new provision taking effect, we have analyzed the provision and worked with our advisors
to evaluate its application to our business. Since all research and development expenditures were incurred within the U.S. and the amount
is immaterial, we do not anticipate it having any material impact to our provision. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the accumulated undistributed loss generated by its foreign subsidiaries were approximately
 million and million of which substantially all was previously subject to U.S. tax, the one-time transition tax on foreign
unremitted earnings required by the Tax Act, or GILTI. Those earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested and accordingly, no
deferred tax expense is recorded for U.S. federal and state income tax or applicable withholding taxes. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and 2023, unrecognized tax benefits were approximately 0 . The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that,
if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate was as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cumulatively accrued approximately for estimated interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recorded interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component
of income tax benefit, which totaled and for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related
to the Company s continuing operations. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to its unrecognized tax benefits
within the next 12 months. 

Nova
Lifestyle and Diamond Bar are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and tax years 2020-2023 remain open to examination by tax
authorities in the U.S.

On
May 15, 2019, Wilson Samuels (the Samuels Action filed a largely duplicative putative derivative complaint purportedly
on behalf of the Company against the same current and former directors and officers named in the Jie Action other than Steven
Qiang Liu. That action was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Samuels repeats the allegations
of the Complaint in the Jie Action. Additionally, Samuels claims that, in announcing its change of auditing firms in September
2016, the Company asserted that it made this move because its existing auditor ceased auditing public companies subject to regulation
in the United States without disclosing that its new auditing firm was created in a merger of three accounting firms, including a firm
whose registration was revoked by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Samuels also claims that the Company redeemed its stock
in reliance upon the same purported fraudulent recognition of revenues claimed in the putative class action. Samuels purports to state
direct claims under Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5. 

On
March 3, 2020, the defendants filed motions to stay the derivative actions until the Barney Action is resolved or alternatively to dismiss
on the grounds that plaintiffs failure to make demand upon the Board of Directors was not excused and the Complaints otherwise
fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. By Order entered April 7, 2020, the Court granted defendants Motion to
Stay and stayed the Jie Action until the Barney Action is resolved. The Court subsequently entered a similar Order in the Samuels Action.
It also took a motion that the derivative plaintiffs filed to consolidate the proceedings and appoint lead counsel off calendar. 

With
the final settlement of the Barney Action, the conditions for the stay have expired. The Court issued an Order requiring the parties
to submit a proposed order activating the cases. The parties requested a thirty-day extension. To date, plaintiffs counsel has
not pushed the issue. 

While
these derivative actions are purportedly asserted on behalf of the Company, when they are subsequently activated, the Company likely
will incur attorneys fees and costs in response to indemnity demands from the defendant directors and officers. Plaintiffs also
seek to require corporate governance changes. The Company believes there is no basis to the derivative complaints and they will be vigorously
defended if necessary. 

Other
than the above, the Company is not currently a party to any legal proceeding, investigation or claim which, in the opinion of the management,
is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations.

Overview 

Nova
LifeStyle, Inc. is a distributor of contemporary styled residential and commercial furniture incorporated into a dynamic marketing and
sales platform offering retail as well as online selection and global purchase fulfillment. We monitor popular trends and products to
create design elements that are then integrated into our product lines that can be used as both stand-alone or whole-room and home furnishing
solutions. Through our global network of retailers, e-commerce platforms, stagers and hospitality providers, Nova LifeStyle also sells
(through an exclusive third-party manufacturing partner) a managed variety of high quality bedding foundation components. 

Nova
LifeStyle s brand family currently includes Nova LifeStyle, Diamond Sofa www.diamondsofa.com and Nova Living. 

Our
customers principally consist of distributors and retailers with specific geographic territories that deploy middle to high end private
label home furnishings which have very little competitive overlap with our specific furnishing products or product lines. Nova LifeStyle
is constantly seeking to integrate new sources of distribution and manufacturing that are properly aligned with our growth strategy.
This allows us to continually focus on building both our overall distribution and manufacturing relationships through a deployment of
popular, as well as trend-based, furnishing solutions worldwide. 

We
are a U.S. holding company with no material assets in the U.S. other than the ownership interests of our wholly owned subsidiaries through
which we market, design and sell residential and commercial furniture worldwide: Nova Furniture Limited domiciled in the British Virgin
Islands Nova Furniture ), Nova Furniture Ltd. domiciled in Samoa Nova Samoa ), Diamond Bar Outdoors, Inc.
domiciled in California Diamond Bar ), Nova Living (M) SDN. BHD. domiciled in Malaysia Nova Malaysia and
Nova Living (HK) Group Limited domiciled in Hong Kong Nova HK ). The Company had three former subsidiaries Bright Swallow
International Group Limited domiciled in Hong Kong Bright Swallow or BSI which was sold in January 2020,
and Nova Furniture Macao Commercial Offshore Limited domiciled in Macao Nova Macao which was de-registration and liquidation
in January 2021. In February 2022, Nova HK entered a de-registration process and transferred all its assets and business to Nova Malaysia.
The process of de-registration and liquidation of Nova HK was completed in February 2023. 

On
December 7, 2017, we incorporated i Design Blockchain Technology, Inc. i Design under the laws of the State of California.
The purpose of i Design is to build our own blockchain technology team. i Design is in the planning stage and has had minimum operations
to date. On December 12, 2019, we became the sole shareholder of Nova Living (M) SDN. BHD. Nova Malaysia ), a company incorporated
on July 26, 2019 under the laws of Malaysia. Nova Malaysia markets and sells high-end physiotherapeutic jade mats for use in therapy
clinics, hospitality, and real estate projects in Malaysia and other regions in Southeast Asia.

On
November 5, 2020, Nova LifeStyle, Inc. acquired Nova Living (HK) Group Limited Nova HK which was incorporated in Hong
Kong on November 6, 2019. This company had minimal operations. In February 2022, Nova HK entered a de-registration process and transferred
all its assets and business to Nova Malaysia. The process of de-registration and liquidation of Nova HK was completed in February 2023. 

Our
experience developing and marketing products for international markets has enabled us to develop the scale, logistics, marketing, manufacturing
efficiencies and design expertise that serve as the foundation for us to expand aggressively into the highly attractive U.S., Canada,
South America, Asia and Middle Easter markets. 

In
2019, we developed a line of high-end physiotherapeutic jade mats with China-based manufacturing partners for use in therapy clinics,
hospitality, and real estate projects in Asia. We launched our first flagship showroom/retail store in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in late
2019, which, after a COVID-19 related closing, was reopened in May 2020. On August 28, 2020, after few months reopening, Malaysia government
extended Movement Control Order to prohibit the businesses to open to public until March 5, 2021 to contain the spread of COVID-19. After
the re-opening on March 5, 2021, Malaysia imposed a new nationwide lockdown on May 12, 2021 until early June 2021 which was subsequently
extended to early October 2021. In October 2021, the Order was lifted for people who are fully vaccinated and our store has been reopened
since. In April 2022, Malaysia has reopened the border for foreign visitors. In June 2023, everything is back to normal in Malaysia.
Due to the negative impact caused by COVID-19 from 2020 to 2022, the Company eventually sold the entire jade mats inventory for 2.00
million in liquidation sales in June 2023. We exited from Jade Mats business in 2023. Nova Malaysia has engaged in the development of
an innovative home decoration design, showroom and payment IT software systems. We have limited experience with operations in Southeast
Asia and considerable management attention and resources may be required to manage these new markets and product lines. We may be subject
to additional risks including credit risk, inflation, currency exchange rate fluctuations, foreign exchange controls, import and export
requirements, potentially adverse tax consequences and higher costs associated with doing business internationally. 

We
do not have access to a revolving credit facility. On May 4, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of approximately
 139,802 under the Paycheck Protection Program PPP ). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic
Security Act CARES Act ), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly
payroll expenses of the qualifying business. On May 5, 2020, Diamond Bar Outdoors Inc. Diamond Bar was granted a loan
from Cathay Bank in the aggregate amount of 176,294, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program. On June 19, 2020, Diamond Bar was
granted a U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan in the aggregate amount of 150,000, pursuant to the Economic Injury Disaster
Loan. In July 2021, we completed a registered direct offering of our shares of common stock and received offering gross proceeds of 3,120,622.
In May 2024 and August 2024, we completed two private placements for gross proceeds of 600,000. We currently believe that our financial
resources will be adequate to finance our operations in the next 12 months. However, in the event that we do need to raise capital in
the future, the instability in the securities markets could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. 

On
April 18, 2024, the Company received written notice from the NASDAQ Stock Market NASDAQ stating that the Company does
not meet the requirement of maintaining a minimum of 2,500,000 in stockholders equity for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital
Market, as set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), the Company also does not meet the alternative of market value of listed securities
of 35 million under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) or net income from continuing operations of 500,000 in the most recently completed
fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(3), and the Company is
no longer in compliance with the NASDAQ Listing Rules. 

The
NASDAQ notification letter provides the Company until June 6, 2024 to submit a plan to regain compliance. If the plan is accepted, NASDAQ
can grant the Company an extension up to 180 calendar days from the date of NASDAQ letter to demonstrate compliance. If NASDAQ does not
accept the Company s compliance plan, the Company will have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a Hearing Panel per NASDAQ
Listing Rule 5815(a). 

The
Company submitted its plan of compliance on May 28, 2024 and a supplemental letter to the plan of compliance on June 20, 2024. On June
27, 2024, the Company received a notification letter from NASDAQ Listing Qualification Staff Staff ). Based on the review
of the letters submitted by the Company, Staff has determined to grant the Company an extension until October 14, 2024 to regain compliance
with the Rule and the Company must complete its initiatives and provide evidences for the compliance with the Rule as required by NASDAQ. 

The Company and Nova Samoa have entered into orders
to purchase inventories in total amount of 4,650,000, which will be paid in 3,321,429 shares Transaction of common stock
of the Company at US 1.40 per share, as disclosed in the Form 8-K filed by the Company with SEC on October 11, 2024 (the Form 8-K ).
The Company believes it has regained compliance with the stockholders equity requirement based upon the Transaction. 

Based on the Form 8-K, staff of NASDAQ Staff has determined that the Company complies with the Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). However, as noted in its letter dated, June 27, 2024, if the
Company fails to evidence compliance upon filing its next periodic report covering the period of the Transaction, it may be subject to
delisting. At that time, Staff will provide written notification to the Company, which may then appeal Staff s determination to
a Hearings Panel.

Principal
Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance 

Since
2019, we have moved away from low margin products and this move was intended to improve our gross profit margin, receivable collections
and net profitability, and to increase our return on long-term equity. We terminated sales and marketing efforts to customers that represented
a high purchase volume but low profit margin, and we adjusted our product line, which included the launch of our Summer 2024 Collection
in the Las Vegas and High Point Markets, with a view to attracting a higher-end ultimate customer. The core focus of the Company s
direction today is entirely centered on product. Identifying a fashion-driven generational shift in the general perception and consumption
of furniture and being more aware of actual consumer tastes and how best to fulfill and engage that need. Closely integrating product
development alongside marketing results in appealing products that adheres to the scope of our target demographic of decision makers
in the design, staging and retail fields. A process that is continually refined upon each release cycle, maintaining a singular, cohesive
vision. In short, we have better identified our customers and how to cater to them in the process gaining greater traction with
every product launch considerably more so on an international level than ever previous. We believe these new strategies, will provide
us with significant long term growth opportunities. Significant factors that we believe could affect our operating results are the (i)
prices of our products to our domestic and international retailer and wholesaler customers and their markups to end consumers; (ii) general
economic conditions in the U.S., Chinese, and other international markets; and (iii) trade tariffs imposed by the United States on certain
products manufactured in China; and (iv) the recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak throughout the world; and (v) high interest rate, inflation
and slow- down in real estate market. We believe most of our customers are willing to pay for our high quality and stylish products,
timely delivery, and strong production capacity at price levels which we expect will allow us to maintain a relatively high gross profit
margin for our products. We do not manufacture our products, but instead we utilize third-party manufacturers. In response to the tariffs
imposed by the United States on certain products manufactured in China, we are in the process of shifting a portion of our product manufacturing
from third-party manufacturers located in China to third-party manufacturers located in other parts of Asia, such as Vietnam, India and/or
Malaysia, countries unaffected by the tariffs. Implementation of a relocation of manufacturing (which by necessity includes an assessment
of the factory s ability to deliver the quantity of the product, in accordance with the Company s specifications, and in
accordance with the Company s quality control requirements) is time-consuming, but a portion of our manufacturing has been transitioned
to Malaysia and India starting in 2020 and we expect that more of our manufacturing will be transitioned to one or more of these venues.
Some of our manufacturing will continue to be performed in China because the intellectual know-how necessary to manufacture certain products
is not generally available in other Asian countries. Consumer preference trends favoring high quality and stylish products and lifestyle-based
furniture suites should also allow us at least to maintain our gross profit margins. The markets in North America is challenging because
such markets are experiencing a slow-down and may be entering a recession due to high interest rate and inflation. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

While
our significant accounting policies are described more fully in Note 2 to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this
Management s Discussion and Analysis. 

There
have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates
described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP for Nova LifeStyle and its subsidiaries, Diamond Bar, i Design, Nova
Furniture, Nova Samoa, Nova Malaysia and its former subsidiary, Nova HK.

Reverse
Split 

On
May 22, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of Nevada with an effective date of May 22, 2023,
at which time a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of the Company s authorized shares of common stock, par value 0.001, accompanied by
a corresponding decrease in the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the Reverse Stock Split ),
was effected. All references to shares and per share data have been retroactively restated to reflect such split. 

Amendments
to Articles of Incorporation 

On
September 5, 2023, the Company filed the Certificate of Change (the Amendment with the Secretary of State for the State
of Nevada to amend its Articles of Incorporation to increase the amount of authorized shares of its common stock, par value 0.001 per
share, from 3,000,000 to 250,000,000. The Amendment was approved by the Company s Board of Directors (the Board on June 28, 2023 and by the shareholders at a special meeting of the Company s shareholders held on August 31, 2023. The Amendment
does not affect the rights of the Company s shareholders and was effective immediately upon filing. 

Use
of Estimates 

In
preparing condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the condensed
consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant
estimates and assumptions made by management include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, the allowance for bad debt, valuation
of inventories, the valuation of stock-based compensation, income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowance for deferred
tax liabilities, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, and loss contingencies. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. 

Accounts
Receivable 

Our
accounts receivable arises from product sales. We do not adjust receivables for the effects of a significant financing component at contract
inception if we expect to collect the receivables in one year or less from the time of sale. We do not expect to collect receivables
greater than one year from the time of sale. Our policy is to maintain an allowance for expected credit losses on accounts receivable.
We review the composition of accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness,
current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. We maintained an allowance
for expected credit loss of 1,281 and 532 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, expected credit losses provision (reversal) was 749 and 2,222), respectively; 832) and 2,026) for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had gross receivable of 128,081 of which
 2,546 was over 90 days past due. The allowance for expected credit losses is our best estimate of the amount of expected credit losses
in our existing trade accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on historical bad debt experience, customer concentrations,
customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns. 

Advances
to Suppliers 

Advances
to suppliers represent amounts paid to suppliers in advance for goods that are yet to be delivered and from which future economic benefits
are expected to flow to the Company within the normal operating cycle. Based on our historical records and in normal circumstances, we
generally receive goods within 4 to 6 months from the date the advance payment is made.

Income
Taxes 

In
its interim financial statements, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 270 Interim Reporting and ASC 740 Income
Taxes whereby the Company utilizes the expected annual effective rate in determining its income tax provision. The income tax
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are 5,087 and 149,771, respectively; and 211 and 147,371 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Income
taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences
in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end
based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

The
Company follows ASC Topic 740, which prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement
of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on recognition of income tax assets
and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated
with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. 

Under
the provisions of ASC Topic 740, when tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination
by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position
that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which,
based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination,
including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more
than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated
with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits
in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon
examination. 

Nova
Lifestyle, Inc. and Diamond Bar are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. Nova Furniture BVI was incorporated in the BVI and
Nova Samoa was incorporated in Samoa. There is no income tax for companies domiciled in the BVI and Samoa. Accordingly, the Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not present any income tax provisions related to the BVI and Samoa tax jurisdictions
where Nova Furniture BVI and Nova Samoa are domiciled. Nova Malaysia is incorporated in Malaysia and is subject to Malaysia income taxes
at the statutory rate of 24 . 

The
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings such as global intangible
low-taxed income GILTI under IRC Section 951A, which is effective for the Company for tax years beginning after January
1, 2018. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has calculated its best estimate of the impact of the GILTI in its
income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing. 

On
December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal
Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 effective for tax years beginning
after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial system,
and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. 

On
March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act contains numerous income tax provisions,
such as relaxing limitations on the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating losses (NOLs) arising in taxable years beginning
after December 31, 2017. 

Beginning
in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year
incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years. While it is possible that Congress may defer, modify,
or repeal this provision, potentially with retroactive effect, we have no assurance that this provision will be deferred, modified, or
repealed. Furthermore, in anticipation of the new provision taking effect, we have analyzed the provision and worked with our advisors
to evaluate its application to our business. Since all research and development expenditures were incurred within the U.S. and the amount
is immaterial, we do not anticipate it having any material impact to our provision.

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the accumulated undistributed earnings generated by its foreign subsidiaries were approximately
 25.4 million and 25.4 million of which substantially all was previously subject to U.S. tax, the one-time transition tax on foreign
unremitted earnings required by the Tax Act, or GILTI. Those earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested and accordingly, no
deferred tax expense is recorded for U.S. federal and state income tax or applicable withholding taxes. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and 2023, unrecognized tax benefits were approximately 0. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that,

Nova
Lifestyle and Diamond Bar are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and tax years 2020-2023 remain open to examination by tax
authorities in the U.S. 

Intangible
Assets 

Intangible
assets consist primarily of computer software acquired for internal use. Acquired intangible assets are initially recorded at the acquisition-date
fair value. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and are carried at cost less accumulated
amortization. The estimated useful life of computer software is generally 5 years. 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
recognize revenues when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which
it expects to receive in exchange for those goods. We recognize revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASU No. 606:
(i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction
price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we
satisfy the performance obligation. 

Revenue
from product sales is recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which typically occurs upon shipment to the customer.
We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that it would
have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial. 

Revenue
from product sales is recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts
with our customers. 

Product
revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts,
returns and rebates. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified
as reductions of accounts receivable as the amount is payable to our customer. 

36 

 Table of Contents 

Our
sales policy allows for the return of product within the warranty period if the product is defective and the defects are our fault. As
alternatives for the product return option, the customers have the option of asking us for a discount for products with quality issues,
or of receiving replacement parts from us at no cost. The amount of reserves for return of products, the discount provided to the customers,
and cost for the replacement parts were immaterial for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

We
generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded
within selling expenses on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Foreign
Currency Translation and Transactions 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in United States Dollar or USD ),
which is also the functional currency of Nova LifeStyle, Nova Furniture, Nova Samoa, Diamond Bar, and i Design. 

The
Company s subsidiary with operations in Malaysia uses its local currency, Malaysian Ringgit RM ), as its functional
currency. An entity s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates, which is normally
the currency of the environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. Management s judgment is essential to
determine the functional currency by assessing various indicators, such as cash flows, sales price and market, expenses, financing and
inter-company transactions and arrangements. 

Foreign
currency transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using
the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at
the balance sheet date are re-measured at the applicable rates of exchange in effect at that date. Gains and losses resulting from foreign
currency re-measurement are included in the statements of operations. 

The
financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate
in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average of the exchange rates in effect during the
reporting period. Stockholders equity accounts are translated using the historical exchange rates at the date the entry to stockholders 
equity was recorded, except for the change in retained earnings during the period, which is translated using the historical exchange
rates used to translate each period s income statement. Differences resulting from translating functional currencies to the reporting
currency are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the balance sheets. 

Translation
of amounts from RM into U.S. dollars has been made at the following exchange rates:

Segment
Reporting 

ASC
Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires use of the management approach model for segment reporting. The management
approach model is based on the way a company s chief operating decision maker organizes segments within the company for making
operating decisions, assessing performance and allocating resources. Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography,
legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in which management disaggregates a company. 

37 

 Table of Contents 

We
determined that our operations constitute a single reportable segment in accordance with ASC 280. We operate exclusively in one business
and industry segment: the design and sale of furniture. 

We
concluded that we had one reportable segment under ASC 280 because Diamond Bar is a furniture distributor based in California focusing
on customers in the US and Nova Malaysia is a furniture retailer and distributor focusing on customers primarily in Malaysia and Asia.
Each of our subsidiaries is operated under the same senior management of our company, and we view the operations of Diamond Bar and Nova
Malaysia as a whole for making business decisions. Our long-lived assets are mainly property, plant and equipment located in the United
States and Malaysia for administrative purposes. 

Net
sales to customers by geographic area are determined by reference to the physical product shipment delivery locations requested by our
customers. For example, if the products are delivered to a customer in the U.S., the sales are recorded as generated in the U.S.; if
the customer directs us to ship its products to China, the sales are recorded as sold in China. 

New
Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently
Adopted Accounting Standards 

In
January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ASU 2017-04 ). ASU 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the two-step goodwill impairment test, under which a goodwill impairment
loss was measured by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
ASU 2017-04 requires only a one-step quantitative impairment test, whereby a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of a
reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value (not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit). This
Update is effective for smaller reporting companies for their annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2022, which is required to be applied prospectively from the date of adoption. The Company adopted ASU 2017-04 for
its interim and annual goodwill impairment tests beginning January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 did not have any impact on our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Recently
Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In
March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, Lease (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements, which clarifies the accounting for leasehold
improvements associated with leases between entities under common control (hereinafter referred to as common control lease). ASU 2023-01
requires entities to amortize leasehold improvements associated with common control lease over the useful life to the common control
group (regardless of the lease term) as long as the lessee controls the use of the underlying asset through a lease, and to account for
any remaining leasehold improvements as a transfer between entities under common control through an adjustment to equity when the lessee
no longer controls the underlying asset. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been
made available for issuance. An entity may apply ASU 2023-01 either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-01 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statement presentations and disclosures. 

ln
December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories
in the rate reconciliation,(2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between
domestic and foreign) and (3)income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU
2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among
other changes. The guidance is effective for annual period beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual
financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis,
but retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on
its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

We
do not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have a material
impact on our financial statement presentation or disclosures.

Net
Sales 

Net
sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.62 million, an increase of 6 from 2.48 million for the same period of 2023.
This increase in net sales resulted primarily from 19 increase in average selling price, while partially offset by 11 decrease in sales
volume. Our three largest selling product categories for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were sofas, beds and coffee tables,
which accounted for approximately 50 , 13 and 8 of sales, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the three largest
selling categories were sofas, beds and chairs, which accounted for approximately 44 , 17 and 10 of sales, respectively. 

The
 0.14 million increase in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, was mainly due
to increased sales to North America. Sales to North America increased by 5 to 2.55 million for the three months ended September 30,
2024, compared to 2.43 million for the same period of 2023, such increase mainly due to more sales order received from our customers
in North America. Also, sales to other countries increased by 29,330 to 64,208 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from
 34,878 for the same period of 2023, primary due to more direct container sales in other countries. However, the increase in net sales
was partially offset by the decrease in sales to Asia. Sales to Asia decreased by 100 to 0 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 0.01 million for the same period of 2023, such decreased mainly due to our liquidation sales of the entire inventory
of jade mats by Nova Malaysia for 1.99 million in Malaysia during the second quarter of 2023. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales consists primarily of costs of finished goods purchased from third-party manufacturers. Total cost of sales increased by 2 
to 1.44 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.41 million for the same period of 2023. Cost of sales
as a percentage of sales decreased to 55 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 57 for the same period of 2023.
The increase in cost of sales in dollar term was mainly due to increased net sales. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of
sales is a result of two factors: (a) we sold less direct containers which came with low profit margin since we shift to focus on high quality product
with high profit margin; and (b) our decreased inventory write down (reversal) of 2,618) for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to inventory write down of 23,544 for the same period of 2023.

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit was 1.18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.06 million for the same period of 2023, representing
an increase in gross profit of 0.11 million. Our gross profit margin was 45 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 43 for the same period of 2023. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was mainly a result of sales of high-quality
products which came with high profit margin during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses consisted of selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development. Operating expenses were 3.59 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.12 million for the same period of 2023. Selling expenses decreased by 30 ,
or 0.18 million, to 0.42 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 0.59 million for the same period of 2023, primarily
due to decreased marketing and advertising expenses. On the other hand, general and administrative expenses increased by 28 , or 0.43
million, to 1.95 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.52 million for the same period of 2023, primarily due
to an increase in consulting fees of 0.93 million and travel of 0.04 million, while the increase was partially offset by a decrease
in bad debt of 0.19 million, depreciation of 0.12 million and stock compensation of 0.16 million. In addition, research and development
increased by 1.22 million to 1.22 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 0 million for the same period of 2023,
primarily due to acquisitions of IT systems for integrating with our existing IT system during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Other
Expenses, Net 

Other
expenses, net was 58,986 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expenses, net of 90,321 for the same period
of 2023, representing a decrease in other expenses of 31,335. The decrease in other expenses was due primarily to a decrease in foreign
exchange loss by 43,664 to 74 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from foreign exchange loss of 43,738 for the same period
of 2023. The decrease in foreign exchange loss was mainly a result of the depreciation of U.S. dollar against Malaysian Ringgit on acquisition
of two IT systems in U.S. dollars. 

Income
Tax Expenses 

Income
tax expenses were 211 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 147,371 for the same period
of 2023, representing a decrease in income tax expense of 147,160. The decrease in income tax expenses were primarily due to no taxable
income from Nova Malaysia. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the income tax expense was primarily due to the net taxable
income from Nova Malaysia. The net taxable income was resulted from the income from debt forgiveness to Nova Malaysia from Nova HK, while
offset with inventory impairment loss incurred in Malaysia, current operating loss and prior year net operating loss in Nova Malaysia. 

Net
Loss 

As
a result of the foregoing, our net loss was 2.47 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.29 million for
the same period of 2023.

Net
Sales 

Net
sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 7.68 million, a decrease of 13 from 8.81 million for the same period of 2023.
This decrease in net sales resulted primarily from 43 decrease in sales volume, while partially offset by 53 increase in average selling
price. Our three largest selling product categories for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were sofas, beds and coffee tables,
which accounted for approximately 51 , 13 and 8 of sales, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the three largest
selling categories were sofa, jade mats, and beds, which accounted for approximately 34 , 22 and 13 of sales, respectively. 

The
 1.13 million decrease in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, was mainly due
to decreased sales to Asia. Sales to Asia decreased by 100 to 0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.00
million for the same period of 2023, such decrease mainly due to our liquidation sales of the entire inventory of jade mats by Nova Malaysia
for 2.00 million in Malaysia during nine months ended September 30, 2023. Also, sales to other countries decreased by 14,019 to 172,076
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 186,095 for the same period of 2023, primarily due to less direct container sales
in other countries. However, the decrease in net sales in Asia and other countries was partially offset by the increase in sales to North
America. Sales to North America increased by 0.89 million to 7.51 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 6.62
million for the same period of 2023, primary due to more sales order received from our customers in North America. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales consists primarily of costs of finished goods purchased from third-party manufacturers. Total cost of sales decreased by 24 
to 4.29 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.64 million for the same period of 2023. Cost of sales as
a percentage of sales decreased to 56 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 64 for the same period of 2023. The
decrease in cost of sales in dollar term was mainly due to decreased net sales. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales
is a result of two factors: (a) the decrease in average purchase cost; and (b) the liquidation sales of the jade mats in Malaysia which
came with high cost and low profit margin in the second quarter of 2023. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit was 3.39 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.17 million for the same period of 2023, representing
an increase in gross profit of 0.22 million. Our gross profit margin was 44 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 36 for the same period of 2023. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was mainly a result of the liquidation sales
of the jade mats in Malaysia which came with low profit margin during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses consisted of selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development. Operating expenses were 7.78 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.79 million for the same period of 2023. Selling expenses decreased by 26 ,
or 0.49 million, to 1.38 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.87 million for the same period of 2023, primarily
due to decreased marketing and advertising expenses. On the other hand, general and administrative expenses increased by 13 , or 0.05
million, to 4.43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.90 million for the same period of 2023, primarily due
to an increase in consulting fee of 0.95 million and stock compensation of 0.17 million, while the increase was partially offset by
a decrease in bad debt of 0.19 million and depreciation of 0.16 million. In addition, research and development increased by 193 ,
or 1.96 million to 1.97 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 10,144 for the same period of 2023, primary due
to our spending on two IT systems and AI-Calculation engine which are for integrating with our AI and IT system.

Other
Expenses, Net 

Other
expenses, net was 94,300 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expenses, net of 286,970 for the same period
of 2023, representing a decrease in other expenses of 192,670. The decrease in other expenses was due primarily to an increase in foreign
exchange gain by 247,974 to 70,575 for the September months ended September 30, 2024, from foreign exchange loss of 177,399 for the
same period of 2023. The increase in foreign exchange gain in 2024 from foreign exchange in 2023 loss was mainly a result of the appreciation
of U.S. dollar against Malaysian Ringgit on acquisition of two IT systems and AI-Calculation engine in U.S. dollars during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. 

Income
Tax Expenses 

Income
tax expenses were 5,087 and 149,771 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax expenses for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were mainly due to minimum California state tax incurred in US subsidiaries. The income tax
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to the net taxable income from Nova Malaysia. The net taxable
income was resulted from the income from debt forgiveness to Nova Malaysia from Nova HK, while offset with inventory impairment loss
incurred in Malaysia, current operating loss and prior year net operating loss in Nova Malaysia. 

Net
Loss 

As
a result of the foregoing, our net loss was 4.49 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.05 million for
the same period of 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
principal demands for liquidity are related to our efforts to increase sales and purchase inventory, and for expenditures related to
sales distribution and general corporate purposes. We intend to meet our liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related
to purchase of inventories and the expansion of our business, primarily through cash flow provided by operations, collections of accounts
receivable, and credit facilities from banks. 

We
rely primarily on internally generated cash flow and available working capital to support growth. We may seek additional financing in
the form of bank loans or other credit facilities or funds raised through offerings of our equity or debt, if and when we determine such
offerings are required. As of September 30, 2024, we do not have any credit facilities. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents
and anticipated cash receipts from sales of products will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements and capital
expenditures for the next 12 months. 

We
had working capital deficit of 1,278,453 at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1,338,510 from net working capital of 60,057 at December
31, 2023. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.71-to-1 at September 30, 2024. 

The
following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities during the nine months ended September

 Table of Contents 

The
increase in cash outflow was attributable primarily to (i) an increase in cash inflow of 3.13 million for inventory to 0.27 million
cash outflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.86 million cash inflow for the same period of 2023, such increase
in cash outflow being mainly a result of more purchase were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. (ii) an increase in
cash outflow of 0.32 million for accounts receivable to 0.08 million cash outflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from
0.22 million cash inflow for the same period of 2023, such increase in cash outflow being mainly due to more
credit sales, especially the credit sales of the direct containers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The increase
in operating cash outflow was partially offset by an increase in cash inflow of 1.96 million for research and development to 1.96 million
cash inflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 0 million cash inflow for the same period of 2023, such increase in cash
inflow being mainly due to issued our common stocks instead of cash to purchase various IT systems which are integrated with our current
existing IT system. 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in cash outflow of 2.47 million
from 2.47 million of cash used in investing activities for the same period of 2023. We incurred cash outflow of 2.47 million from the
virtual tour and web augmented reality experience software project during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 0.96 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0 for the same period
of 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed 0.36 million from a shareholder and sold 325,000 shares of common
stock with the proceeds of 0.60 million for our working capital. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had gross accounts receivable of 128,081 of which 35,682 was not yet past due and 89,852 was less than
90 days past due. We had an allowance for expected credit losses of 1,281. As of November 4, 2024, 61.6 or 78,930 of accounts
receivable outstanding as of September 30, 2024 had been collected. 

100 
of our accounts receivable outstanding at December 31, 2023 had been collected during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had advances to suppliers of 132,678 and 93,740, respectively. These supplier prepayments
are made for goods before we actually receive them. 

For
a new product, the normal lead time from new product R D, prototype, and mass production to delivery of goods from our suppliers
to us is approximately six to nine months after we make advance payments to our suppliers. For other products, the typical time is 4-6
months after our advance payment. We will consider the need for a reserve when and if a supplier fails to fulfill our orders within the
time frame as stipulated in the purchase contracts. 

As
of November 4, 2024, 32,203 or 41 and 93,740 or 100 of our advances to suppliers outstanding at September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023 had been delivered to us in the form of purchases of furniture. 

Other
Long-Term Liabilities 

As
of September 30, 2024, we recorded long-term taxes payable of 0.64 million, consisting of an income tax payable of 0.64 million, primarily
arising from a one-time transition tax recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 on our post-1986 foreign unremitted earnings, as ASC
740 specifies that tax positions for which the timing of the ultimate resolution is uncertain should be recognized as long-term liabilities. 

We
elected to pay the one-time transition tax over the eight years commencing April 2018.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
have evaluated, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ),
the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that as
of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as described above. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that
occurred during or subsequent to the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

On
March 8, 2019, Jie Yuan (the Jie Action filed a putative shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District
Court for the Central District of California, purportedly on behalf of the Company against its former and current CEOs and CFOs
(Thanh H. Lam, Ya Ming Wong, Jeffery Chuang and Yuen Ching Ho) and directors (Charlie Huy La, Bin Liu, Umesh Patel, and Min Su) and
vice president (Steven Qiang Liu) (collectively, the Defendants ). In this action, the putative derivative plaintiffs
seek to recover any losses the Company sustains as a result of alleged securities violations that were alleged in the matter of Barney
v. Nova Lifestyle, Inc. , United States District Court for the Central District of California. It is alleged that the Defendants caused the
Company to make the alleged false and/or misleading statements giving rise to the Barney Action. The Plaintiff also alleges
that President and CEO Lam engaged in self-dealing transactions by leasing her property to Diamond Bar, a Company subsidiary, and
asserts, in conclusory fashion, that Lam, former CEO and director Ya Ming Wong, former CFO and director Yuen Ching Ho, and director
Umesh Patel sold securities during the period of time when the alleged false and/or misleading statements were made with
knowledge of material non-public information. 

In
the Barney action, the putative class plaintiffs alleged that the Company artificially inflated its share price by issuing a press
release announcing a strategic relationship with Shanxi Winqing Senior Care Service Group, claiming in the Company s Annual Statements
on Form 10-Ks for the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years that Shanxi Winqing and Merlino Lewis LLP were among the Company s largest customers,
and reporting revenues from sales transactions with these entities. Plaintiffs claimed that Shanxi Winqing was a fictitious entity and
Merlno Lewis LLP dissolved in 2013, so that the announcement of a strategic alliance was false and the reported revenues non-existent.
The Company denied these allegations and all liability. It asserted that the entities referenced in its public disclosures were actual
companies and the revenues booked from those entities were genuine and actually collected. The Company alleged that no registration exists
for Shanxi Winqing because the Company slightly mistranslated its Chinese name in its public disclosures. Similarly, the Company claimed
to have previously sold products to Merlino Lewis LLP and failed to update its customer name when the customer restructured its business. 

On
May 15, 2019, Wilson Samuels (the Samuels Action filed a largely duplicative putative derivative complaint purportedly
on behalf of the Company against the same current and former directors and officers named in the Jie Action other than Steven
Qiang Liu. That action was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Samuels repeats the allegations
of the Complaint in the Jie Action. Additionally, Samuels claims that, in announcing its change of auditing firms in September
2016, the Company asserted that it made this move because its existing auditor ceased auditing public companies subject to regulation
in the United States without disclosing that its new auditing firm was created in a merger of three accounting firms, including a firm
whose registration was revoked by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Samuels also claims that the Company redeemed its stock
in reliance upon the same purported fraudulent recognition of revenues claimed in the putative class action. Samuels purports to state
direct claims under Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5. 

On
March 3, 2020, the defendants filed motions to stay the derivative actions until the Barney Action is resolved or alternatively to dismiss
on the grounds that plaintiffs failure to make demand upon the Board of Directors was not excused and the Complaints otherwise
fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. By Order entered April 7, 2020, the Court granted defendants Motion to
Stay and stayed the Jie Action until the Barney Action is resolved. The Court subsequently entered a similar Order in the Samuels Action.
It also took a motion that the derivative plaintiffs filed to consolidate the proceedings and appoint lead counsel off calendar.

 Table of Contents 

With
the final settlement of the Barney Action, the conditions for the stay have expired. The Court issued an Order requiring the parties
to submit a proposed order activating the cases. The parties requested a thirty-day extension. To date, plaintiffs counsel has
not pushed the issue. 

With
the settlement of the Barney action, it is expected that the stay of the derivative actions will be lifted. 

While
these derivative actions are purportedly asserted on behalf of the Company, when they are subsequently activated, the Company likely
will incur attorneys fees and costs in response to indemnity demands from the defendant directors and officers. Plaintiffs
also seek to require corporate governance changes. The Company believes there is no basis to the derivative complaints and they will
be vigorously defended if necessary. 

Other
than the above, the Company is not currently a party to any legal proceeding, investigation or claim which, in the opinion of the management,
is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations.
