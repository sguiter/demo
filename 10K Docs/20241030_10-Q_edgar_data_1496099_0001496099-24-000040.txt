 Except as noted in the tables above, there were no other transfers in or out of Level I, II, or III during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Transfers into Level III occur as quotations obtained through pricing services are deemed not representative of fair value as of the balance sheet date and such assets are internally valued. As quotations obtained through pricing services are substantiated through additional market sources, investments are transferred out of Level III. In addition, transfers out of Level III and transfers into Level III occur based on the increase or decrease in the availability of certain observable inputs. 
 The Company invests in revolving credit facilities. These investments are categorized as Level III investments as these assets are not actively traded and their fair values are often implied by the term loans of the respective portfolio companies. 
 The Company generally uses the following framework when determining the fair value of investments where there are little, if any, market activity or observable pricing inputs. The Company typically determines the fair value of its performing debt investments utilizing an income approach. Additional consideration is given using a market based approach, as well as reviewing the overall underlying portfolio company's performance and associated financial risks. The following outlines additional details on the approaches considered: 
 Company Performance, Financial Review, and Analysis: Prior to investment, as part of its due diligence process, the Company evaluates the overall performance and financial stability of the portfolio company. Post investment, the Company analyzes each portfolio company's current operating performance and relevant financial trends versus prior year and budgeted results, including, but not limited to, factors affecting its revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") growth, margin trends, liquidity position, covenant compliance and changes to its capital structure. The Company also attempts to identify and subsequently track any developments at the portfolio company, within its customer or vendor base or within the industry or the macroeconomic environment, generally, that may alter any material element of its original investment thesis. This analysis is specific to each portfolio company. The Company leverages the knowledge gained from its original due diligence process, augmented by this subsequent monitoring, to continually refine its outlook for each of its portfolio companies and ultimately form the valuation of its investment in each portfolio company. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, the Company will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private valuation. 
 For debt investments, the Company may employ the Market Based Approach (as described below) to assess the total enterprise value of the portfolio company, in order to evaluate the enterprise value coverage of the Company s debt investment. For equity investments or in cases where the Market Based Approach implies a lack of enterprise value coverage for the debt investment, the Company may additionally employ a discounted cash flow analysis based on the free cash flows of the portfolio company to assess the total enterprise value. After enterprise value coverage is demonstrated for the Company s debt

 (1) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the investments. 
 (2) Fair value was determined based on transaction pricing or recent acquisition or sale as the best measure of fair value with no material changes in operations of the related portfolio company since the transaction date.

 months commencing on March 1, 2024. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, the Company. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from the Company, consisting of components a base management fee and an incentive fee. On November 1, 2021, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Investment Management Agreement Amendment No. 1 ). As described below, the sole purpose of Amendment No. 1 was to reduce the base management fee from of the Company s gross assets to of the Company s gross assets. 
 Pursuant to Amendment No. 1, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of of the Company's gross assets, which equals the Company's total assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears, and is calculated based on the average value of the Company's gross assets, which equals the Company's total assets, as determined in accordance with GAAP, less cash and cash equivalents at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted on a pro rata basis for any equity capital raises or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. To the extent the Company invests in derivatives, the Company uses the actual value of the derivatives, as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, for purposes of calculating its base management fee. 
 Effective as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 through the quarter ending December 31, 2024, the Investment Adviser entered into a fee waiver agreement (the "Fee Waiver Agreement"), amended on August 7, 2023, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser will waive base management fees in order to reach a target base management fee of on gross assets (the Reduced Base Management Fee ).

 and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, management fees waived were approximately and , respectively. 
 The incentive fee consists of parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equals of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a preferred return , or hurdle , and a catch-up feature. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, upfront, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under an administration agreement, as amended and restated (the Administration Agreement ), with the Administrator, and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock (of which there were as of September 30, 2024), but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, will be compared to a "hurdle rate" of per quarter annualized), subject to a "catch-up" provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. The hurdle rate is appropriately pro-rated for any partial periods. The calculation of the Company s incentive fee with respect to the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for each quarter is as follows: 
 No incentive fee is payable to the Investment Adviser in any calendar quarter in which the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of (the "preferred return" or "hurdle"). 
 of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to in any calendar quarter annualized) is payable to the Investment Adviser. This portion of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to is referred to as the "catch-up". The catch-up provision is intended to provide the Investment Adviser with an incentive fee of on all of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds in any calendar quarter. 
 of the amount of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds in any calendar quarter annualized) is payable to the Investment Adviser once the hurdle is reached and the catch-up is achieved. 
 The second part of the incentive fee will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement) and will equal of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fee. 
 In accordance with GAAP, the Company accrues a hypothetical capital gains incentive fee based upon the cumulative net realized capital gains and realized capital losses and the cumulative net unrealized capital appreciation and unrealized capital depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. Actual amounts paid to the Investment Adviser are consistent with the Investment Management Agreement and are based only on actual realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year.

The Company designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges in a qualifying fair value hedge accounting relationship to mitigate risk of changes in the fair value of financial liabilities due to interest rate risk. As a result, the Company will present changes in fair value of the hedging instruments and the related hedged items in interest expense within the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 The Company recorded and formally documented all hedging relationships, its risk management objective and strategy upon entering into each hedging relationship. For each hedging relationship, the Company performs quarterly quantitative assessments of the hedge effectiveness to assess that the hedging relationships are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values of hedged items and whether the relationship is expected to continue to be highly effective in the future. To the extent the changes in fair value of the derivative do not offset the changes in fair value of the hedged item, the difference is recognized. The corresponding adjustment to the hedged asset or liability is included in the basis of the hedged item, while the corresponding change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded as an adjustment to "Derivative assets at fair value" or "Derivative liabilities at fair value", as applicable. 
 If a hedge relationship is de-designated or if hedge accounting is discontinued because the hedged item no longer exists, the derivative will continue to be recorded as a "Derivative asset at fair value" or "Derivative liability at fair value" in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation).

 SBA-guaranteed debentures On August 1, 2014 and August 25, 2017, respectively, SBIC I and SBIC II received licenses from the SBA to operate as SBICs. 
 These SBIC licenses allow each of SBIC I and SBIC II to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the issuance of a capital commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse to the Company, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten year maturities. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to the assets of SBIC I and SBIC II over the Company's stockholders in the event SBIC I and SBIC II are liquidated or the SBA exercises remedies upon an event of default. 
 The maximum amount of borrowings available under current SBA regulations for a single licensee is 150,000 as long as the licensee has at least 75,000 in regulatory capital, receives a capital commitment from the SBA and has been through an examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing. In June 2018, legislation amended the 1958 Act by increasing the individual leverage limit from 150,000 to 175,000, subject to SBA approvals. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, SBIC I had regulatory capital of and , respectively, and SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, SBIC II had regulatory capital of and , respectively, and and , respectively, of SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding.

 The SBIC program is designed to stimulate the flow of private investor capital into eligible small businesses, as defined by SBA regulations that, among other things: require SBICs to invest in eligible small businesses and invest at least 25.0 of investment capital in eligible smaller enterprises (as defined by the SBA regulations), place certain limitations on the financing terms of investments, regulate the types of financing provided by an SBIC, prohibit investments in small businesses with certain characteristics or in certain industries and require capitalization thresholds that limit distributions to the Company. SBICs are subject to an annual periodic examination by an SBA examiner to determine the SBIC's compliance with the relevant SBA regulations and an annual financial audit of its financial statements that are prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP (such as ASC 820) by an independent auditor. 
 
 Leverage risk factors The Company utilizes and may utilize leverage to the maximum extent permitted by the law for investment and other general business purposes. The Company's lenders will have fixed dollar claims on certain assets that are superior to the claims of the Company's common stockholders, and the Company would expect such lenders to seek recovery against these assets in the event of a default. The use of leverage also magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested. Leverage may magnify interest rate risk (particularly on the Company's fixed-rate investments), which is the risk that the prices of portfolio investments will fall or rise if market interest rates for those types of securities rise or fall. As a result, leverage may cause greater changes in the Company's net asset value. Similarly, leverage may cause a sharper decline in

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of New Mountain Finance Corporation 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of New Mountain Finance Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company"), including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of September 30, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our reviews we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of the Company, including the consolidated schedule of investments as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 26, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

("NMF OEC"), which are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are intended to facilitate our compliance with the requirements to be treated as a RIC under the Code by holding equity or equity related investments in portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies (or other forms of pass-through entities); we consolidate these corporations for accounting purposes but the corporations are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may incur income tax expense as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies; and 
 New Mountain Finance Servicing, L.L.C. ("NMF Servicing"), which serves as the administrative agent on certain investment transactions. 
 New Mountain Net Lease Corporation ("NMNLC") is a majority-owned consolidated subsidiary of ours, which acquires commercial real estate properties that are subject to "triple net" leases has elected to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, within the meaning of Section 856(a) of the Code. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our net asset value was approximately 1,361.3 million and our portfolio had a fair value, as determined in good faith by the board of directors, of approximately 3,265.3 million in 127 portfolio companies, with a weighted average yield to maturity at cost for income producing investments ("YTM at Cost") of approximately 10.5 and a weighted average yield to maturity at cost for all investments ("YTM at Cost for Investments") of approximately 9.5 . The YTM at Cost calculation assumes that all investments, including secured collateralized agreements, not on non-accrual are purchased at cost on the quarter end date and held until their respective maturities with no prepayments or losses and exited at par at maturity. The YTM at Cost for Investments calculation assumes that all investments, including secured collateralized agreements, are purchased at cost on the quarter end date and held until their respective maturities with no prepayments or losses and exited at par at maturity. YTM at Cost and YTM at Cost for Investments calculations exclude the impact of existing

YTM at Cost and YTM at Cost for Investments use Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate ("SONIA"), Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") and Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") curves at each quarter's end date. The actual yield to maturity may be higher or lower due to the future selection of the SONIA, SOFR and EURIBOR contracts by the individual companies in our portfolio or other factors. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 On October 23, 2024, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter 2024 distribution of 0.32 per share and a supplemental distribution related to third quarter earnings of 0.01 per share, each payable on December 31, 2024 to holders of record as of December 17, 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies. 
 Basis of Accounting 
 We consolidate our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries: NMF Holdings, NMF Servicing, NMFDB, SBIC I, SBIC I GP, SBIC II, SBIC II GP, NMF Ancora, NMF QID, NMF YP, NMF Permian, NMF HB, NMF TRM, NMF Pioneer and NMF OEC and our majority-owned consolidated subsidiary, NMNLC. We are an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance as described in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies ("ASC 946"). 
 Valuation and Leveling of Portfolio Investments 
 At all times consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act, we conduct a valuation of our assets, which impacts our net asset value. 
 We value our assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. In all cases, our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of our portfolio investments on a quarterly basis in good faith, including investments that are not publicly traded, those whose market prices are not readily available and any other situation where our portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Our quarterly valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below: 
 (1) Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at such market quotations based on the closing price indicated from independent pricing services. 
 (2) Investments for which indicative prices are obtained from various pricing services and/or brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process, as described below, to determine whether the quote(s) obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP. 
 a. Bond quotes are obtained through independent pricing services. Internal reviews are performed by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser to ensure that the quote obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP and, if so, the quote is used. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote(s) internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below); and 
 b. For investments other than bonds, we look at the number of quotes readily available and perform the following procedures: 
 i. Investments for which two or more quotes are received from a pricing service are valued using the mean of the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained. We will evaluate the reasonableness of the quote, and if the quote is determined to not be representative of fair value, we will use one or more of the methodologies outlined below to determine fair value; 
 ii. Investments for which one quote is received from a pricing service are validated internally. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser analyze the market quotes obtained using an array of valuation methods (further described below) to validate the fair value. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below). 
 117 

Table of Contents 

 (3) Investments for which quotations are not readily available through exchanges, pricing services, brokers, or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process: 
 a. Each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the credit monitoring; 
 b. Preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with our senior management; 
 c. If an investment falls into (3) above for four consecutive quarters and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, then at least once each fiscal year, the valuation for each portfolio investment for which we do not have a readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors; and 
 d. When deemed appropriate by our management, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to review and value investment(s) of a portfolio company, without any preliminary valuation being performed by the Investment Adviser. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser will review and validate the value provided. 
 For investments in revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments, the cost basis of the funded investments purchased is offset by any costs/netbacks received for any unfunded portion on the total balance committed. The fair value is also adjusted for the price appreciation or depreciation on the unfunded portion. As a result, the purchase of a commitment not completely funded may result in a negative fair value until it is called and funded. 
 The values assigned to investments are based upon available information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual positions are liquidated. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuations could be material. 
 GAAP fair value measurement guidance classifies the inputs used in measuring fair value into three levels as follows: 
 Level I Quoted prices (unadjusted) are available in active markets for identical investments and we have the ability to access such quotes as of the reporting date. The type of investments which would generally be included in Level I include active exchange-traded equity securities and exchange-traded derivatives. As required by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"), we, to the extent that we hold such investments, do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price. 
 Level II Pricing inputs are observable for the investments, either directly or indirectly, as of the reporting date, but are not the same as those used in Level I. Level II inputs include the following: 
 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; 
 Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (examples include corporate and municipal bonds, which trade infrequently); 
 Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (examples include most over-the-counter derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts); and 
 Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
 Level III Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. 
 The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels. In all instances when the inputs fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. As such, a Level III fair value measurement may include inputs that are both observable and unobservable. Gains and losses for such assets categorized within the Level III table below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs and unobservable inputs. 
 The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment or estimation by management and consideration of factors specific to each investment. A review of the fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in the transfer of certain investments within the fair value hierarchy from period to period.

 See Item 1 . Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4. Fair Value in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2024. 
 We generally use the following framework when determining the fair value of investments where there are little, if any, market activity or observable pricing inputs. We typically determine the fair value of our performing debt investments utilizing an income approach. Additional consideration is given using a market based approach, as well as reviewing the overall underlying portfolio company's performance and associated financial risks. The following outlines additional details on the approaches considered: 
 Company Performance, Financial Review, and Analysis: Prior to investment, as part of our due diligence process, we evaluate the overall performance and financial stability of the portfolio company. Post investment, we analyze each portfolio company's current operating performance and relevant financial trends versus prior year and budgeted results, including, but not limited to, factors affecting its revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") growth, margin trends, liquidity position, covenant compliance and changes to its capital structure. We also attempt to identify and subsequently track any developments at the portfolio company, within its customer or vendor base or within the industry or the macroeconomic environment, generally, that may alter any material element of our original investment thesis. This analysis is specific to each portfolio company. We leverage the knowledge gained from our original due diligence process, augmented by this subsequent monitoring, to continually refine our outlook for each of our portfolio companies and ultimately form the valuation of our investment in each portfolio company. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private valuation. 
 For debt investments, we may employ the Market Based Approach (as described below) to assess the total enterprise value of the portfolio company, in order to evaluate the enterprise value coverage of our debt investment. For equity investments or in cases where the Market Based Approach implies a lack of enterprise value coverage for the debt investment, we may additionally employ a discounted cash flow analysis based on the free cash flows of the portfolio company to assess the total enterprise value. After enterprise value coverage is demonstrated for our debt investments through the method(s) above, the Income Based Approach (as described below) may be employed to estimate the fair value of the investment. 
 Market Based Approach: We may estimate the total enterprise value of each portfolio company by utilizing EBITDA or revenue multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions. We consider numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose trading multiples are used to value our portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, and relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. We may apply an average of various relevant comparable company EBITDA or revenue multiples to the portfolio company's latest twelve month ("LTM") EBITDA or revenue, or projected EBITDA or revenue to calculate the enterprise value of the portfolio company. Significant increases or decreases in the EBITDA or revenue multiples will result in an increase or decrease in enterprise value, which may result in an increase or decrease in the fair value estimate of the investment. 
 Income Based Approach: We also may use a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the investment. Projected cash flows represent the relevant security's contractual interest, fee and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the investment's expected maturity date. These cash flows are discounted at a rate established utilizing a combination of a yield calibration approach and a comparable investment approach. The yield calibration approach incorporates changes in the credit quality (as measured by relevant statistics) of the portfolio company, as compared to changes in the yield associated with comparable credit quality market indices, between the date of origination and the valuation date. The comparable investment approach utilizes an average yield-to maturity of a selected set of high-quality, liquid investments to determine a comparable investment discount rate. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value measurement.

 New Mountain Net Lease Corporation 
 NMNLC was formed to acquire commercial real estate properties that are subject to "triple net" leases. NMNLC's investments are disclosed on our Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of September 30, 2024. 
 On March 30, 2020, an affiliate of the Investment Adviser purchased directly from NMNLC 105,030 shares of NMNLC s common stock at a price of 107.73 per share, which represented the net asset value per share of NMNLC at the date of purchase, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 11.3 million. Immediately thereafter, NMNLC redeemed 105,030 shares of its common stock held by NMFC in exchange for a promissory note with a principal amount of 11.3 million and a 7.0 interest rate, which was repaid by NMNLC to NMFC on March 31, 2020. Effective July 1, 2024, NMNLC purchased 63,575 shares of NMNLC's common stock from an affiliate of the Investment Adviser at remaining original cost, a price of 73.39 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 4.7 million. Immediately thereafter, NMNLC sold

 Collateralized agreements or repurchase financings 
 We follow the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing Secured Borrowing and Collateral ("ASC 860") when accounting for transactions involving the purchases of securities under collateralized agreements to resell (resale agreements). These transactions are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, as specified in the respective agreements. Interest on collateralized agreements is accrued and recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held one collateralized agreement to resell with a cost basis of 30.0 million and 30.0 million, respectively, and a fair value of 13.5 million and 16.5 million, respectively. The collateralized agreement to resell is on non-accrual. The collateralized agreement to resell is guaranteed by a private hedge fund, PPVA Fund, L.P. The private hedge fund is currently in liquidation under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Pursuant to the terms of the collateralized agreement, the private hedge fund was obligated to repurchase the collateral from us at the par value of the collateralized agreement. The private hedge fund has breached its agreement to repurchase the collateral under the collateralized agreement. The default by the private hedge fund did not release the collateral to us, therefore, we do not have full rights and title to the collateral. A claim has been filed with the Cayman Islands joint official liquidators to resolve this matter. The joint official liquidators have recognized our contractual rights under the collateralized agreement. We continue to exercise our rights under the collateralized agreement and continue to monitor the liquidation process of the private hedge fund. The fair value of the collateralized agreement to resell is reflective of the increased risk of the position. 
 PPVA Black Elk (Equity) LLC 
 On May 3, 2013, we entered into a collateralized securities purchase and put agreement (the SPP Agreement with a private hedge fund. Under the SPP Agreement, we purchased twenty million Class E Preferred Units of Black Elk Energy Offshore Operations, LLC Black Elk for 20.0 million with a corresponding obligation of the private hedge fund, PPVA Black Elk (Equity) LLC, to repurchase the preferred units for 20.0 million plus other amounts due under the SPP Agreement. The majority owner of Black Elk was the private hedge fund. In August 2014, we received a payment of 20.5 million, the full amount due under the SPP Agreement. 
 In August 2017, a trustee (the Trustee for Black Elk informed us that the Trustee intended to assert a fraudulent conveyance claim (the Claim against us and one of its affiliates seeking the return of the 20.5 million repayment. Black Elk filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in August 2015. The Trustee alleged that individuals affiliated with the private hedge fund conspired with Black Elk and others to improperly use proceeds from the sale of certain Black Elk assets to repay, in August 2014, the private hedge fund s obligation to us under the SPP Agreement. We were unaware of these claims at the time the repayment was received. The private hedge fund is currently in liquidation under the laws of the Cayman Islands. 
 On December 22, 2017, we settled the Trustee s 20.5 million Claim for 16.0 million and filed a claim with the Cayman Islands joint official liquidators of the private hedge fund for 16.0 million that is owed to us under the SPP Agreement. The SPP Agreement was restored and is in effect since repayment has not been made. We continue to exercise our rights under the SPP Agreement and continue to monitor the liquidation process of the private hedge fund. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received a 1.5 million payment from our insurance carrier in respect to the settlement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the SPP Agreement had a cost basis of 14.5 million and 14.5 million, respectively, and a fair value of 6.5 million and 8.0 million, respectively, which is reflective of the higher inherent risk in this transaction.

 Interest and dividend income: Interest income, including amortization of premium and discount using the effective interest method, is recorded on the accrual basis and periodically assessed for collectability. Interest income also includes interest earned from cash on hand. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties are recorded as part of interest income. We have loans and certain preferred equity investments in the portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind PIK interest or dividend provision. PIK interest and dividends are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The PIK interest and dividends are added to the principal or share balances on the capitalization dates and are generally due at maturity or when redeemed by the issuer. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized PIK and non-cash interest from investments of approximately 9.1 million and 27.7 million, respectively, and PIK and non-cash dividends from investments of approximately 8.3 million and 23.5 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized PIK and non-cash interest from investments of approximately 7.9 million and 24.8 million, respectively, and PIK and non-cash dividends from investments of approximately 7.0 million and 20.2 million, respectively. 
 Dividend income on common equity is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Dividend income on preferred securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are deemed collectible. 
 Non-accrual income: Investments are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due for 30 days or more and when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued cash and un-capitalized PIK interest or dividends are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends are not reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment of the ultimate collectibility. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. 
 Other income: Other income represents delayed compensation, consent or amendment fees, revolver fees, structuring fees, upfront fees and other miscellaneous fees received and are typically non-recurring in nature. Delayed compensation is income earned from counterparties on trades that do not settle within a set number of business days after trade date. Other income may also include fees from bridge loans. We may from time to time enter into bridge financing commitments, an obligation to provide interim financing to a counterparty until permanent credit can be obtained. These commitments are short-term in nature and may expire unfunded. A fee is received for providing such commitments. Structuring fees and upfront fees are recognized as income when earned, usually when paid at the closing of the investment, and are non-refundable. 
 
 Monitoring of Portfolio Investments 
 We monitor the performance and financial trends of our portfolio companies on at least a quarterly basis. We attempt to identify any developments within the portfolio company, the industry or the macroeconomic environment that may alter any material element of our original investment strategy. Our portfolio monitoring procedures are designed to provide a simple yet comprehensive analysis of our portfolio companies based on their operating performance and underlying business characteristics, which in turn forms the basis of its Risk Rating (as defined below). 
 We use an investment risk rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in the portfolio. As such, we assign each investment a composite score Risk Rating based on two metrics 1) Operating Performance and 2) Business Characteristics: 
 Operating Performance assesses the health of the investment in context of its financial performance and the market environment it faces. The metric is expressed in Tiers of 4 to 1 , with 4 being the best and 1 being the worst: 
 Tier 4 Business performance is in-line with or above expectations 
 Tier 3 Moderate business underperformance and/or moderate market headwinds 
 Tier 2 Significant business underperformance and/or significant market headwinds 
 Tier 1 Severe business underperformance and/or severe market headwinds 
 Business Characteristics assesses the health of the investment in context of the underlying portfolio company s business and credit quality, the underlying portfolio company s current balance sheet, and the level of support from the

 equity sponsor. The metric is expressed as on a qualitative scale of A to C , with A being the best and C being the worst. 
 The Risk Rating for each investment is a composite of these two metrics. The Risk Rating is expressed in categories of Green, Yellow, Orange and Red, with Green reflecting an investment that is in-line with or above expectations and Red reflecting an investment performing materially below expectations. The mapping of the composite scores to these categories are below: 
 Green 4C, 3B, 2A, 4B, 3A, and 4A (e.g., Tier 4 for Operating Performance and C for Business Characteristics) 
 Yellow 3C, 2B, and 1A 
 Orange 2C and 1B

 Our total investment income increased by approximately 1.0 million, or 1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income of approximately 95.3 million consisted of approximately 61.9 million in cash interest from investments, approximately 9.0 million in PIK and non-cash interest from investments, approximately 0.1 million in prepayment fees, net amortization of purchase premiums and discounts of approximately 1.7 million, approximately 12.0 million in cash dividends from investments, approximately 8.4 million in PIK and non-cash dividends from investments and approximately 2.2 million in other income. The decrease in interest income of approximately 1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in total coupon rates on our floating rate investments, partially offset by a larger invested balance. The increase in dividend income of approximately 2.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends from SLP III and an increase in PIK dividends on our preferred equity investments. Other income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which represents fees that are generally non-recurring in nature, was primarily attributable to upfront and amendment fees received from 19 different portfolio companies.

Our management fee, net of a management fee waiver, remained relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our incentive fee decreased by approximately 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in incentives fees was attributable to a decrease in net investment income. Interest and other financing expenses increased by approximately 6.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the acceleration of financing costs upon termination of the DB Credit Facility, an increase in our cost of borrowings due to higher SOFR rates on our floating rate facilities, our 8.250 Unsecured Notes, issued on November 13, 2023 and our 6.875 Unsecured Notes, issued on February 1, 2024, partially offset by the repayment of our 2019A Unsecured Notes on February 5, 2024.

 Our net realized losses and unrealized gains and losses resulted in a net loss of approximately 11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net realized gains and unrealized losses resulting in a net loss of approximately 12.0 million for the same period in 2023. As movement in unrealized appreciation or depreciation can be the result of realizations, we look at net realized and unrealized gains or losses together. The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by unrealized depreciation in New Permian Holdco, Inc., TVG-Edmentum Holdings, LLC ("Edmentum") and AAC, partially offset by unrealized appreciation in HB Wealth Management, LLC ("Homrich"), NM NL Holdings, L.P. and NM YI, LLC. The provision for income taxes was attributable to equity investments that are held as of September 30, 2024 in eight of our corporate subsidiaries. The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by unrealized depreciation in Edmentum and UniTek, partially offset by realized gains in Haven Midstream Holdings LLC and unrealized appreciation in Vectra Co. and TMK Hawk Parent, Corp.

The decrease in interest income of approximately 10.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to lower leverage, resulting in a smaller invested asset base, along with slightly lower yields on the portfolio. The increase in dividend income of approximately 8.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in cash dividends from our investments in SLP III and SLP IV, an increase in PIK dividends on our preferred equity investments and a cash distribution from our common shares investment in OA Topco, L.P.

 Liquidity, Capital Resources, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness, investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate purposes. 
 Since our IPO, and through September 30, 2024, we have raised approximately 1,034.6 million in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock. 
 Our liquidity is generated and generally available through advances from the revolving credit facilities, from cash flows from operations, and, we expect, through periodic follow-on equity offerings. In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. On June 8, 2018 our shareholders approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, which resulted in the reduction of the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to us from 200.0 to 150.0 as of June 9, 2018. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 150.0 after such borrowing (which means we can borrow 2 for every 1 of our equity). As a result of our exemptive relief received on November 5, 2014, we are permitted to exclude the SBA-guaranteed debentures held by SBIC I and SBIC II from the 150.0 asset coverage ratio that we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. The agreements governing the NMFC Credit Facility, the Convertible Notes and certain of the Unsecured Notes (as defined in Item 1 Financial Statements Note 7. Borrowings contain certain covenants and terms, including a requirement that we not exceed a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.65 to 1.00 at the time of incurring additional indebtedness and a requirement that we not exceed a secured debt ratio of 0.70 to 1.00 at any time. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was 179.2 .

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our borrowings consisted of the 2019A Unsecured Notes (repaid on February 5, 2024), 2021A Unsecured Notes, 2022A Unsecured Notes, 8.250 Unsecured Notes, 6.875 Unsecured Notes (issued on February 1, 2024), SBA-guaranteed debentures, Holdings Credit Facility, 2022 Convertible Notes, DB Credit Facility (repaid and terminated on September 30, 2024), NMFC Credit Facility, NMNLC Credit Facility II and Unsecured Management Company Revolver. See Item 1 Financial Statements Note 7. Borrowings in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 61.9 million and 70.1 million, respectively. Our cash (used in) provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was approximately (153.2) million and 207.0 million, respectively. We expect that all current liquidity needs will be met with cash flows from operations and other activities. 
 On November 3, 2021, we entered into an equity distribution agreement, as amended on May 18, 2023, August 23, 2023, June 27, 2024 and August 1, 2024 (the Distribution Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. and Raymond James Associates, Inc. (collectively, the Agents ). The Distribution Agreement originally provided that we may issue and sell our shares from time to time through the Agents, up to 250.0 million worth of our common stock by means of at-the-market ("ATM") offerings. As of the amendment on June 27, 2024, we increased the maximum amount of shares to be sold through the ATM program from 250.0 million to 400.0 million. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares of common stock under the Distribution Agreement. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 5,292,556 shares of common stock under the Distribution Agreement and received total accumulated net proceeds of approximately 67.7 million, including 0.0 million of offering expenses, from these sales. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 502,623 and 502,623 shares, respectively, of common stock, under the Distribution Agreement and received total accumulated net proceeds of approximately 6.6 million and 6.6 million, respectively, including 0.0 million and 0.0 million, respectively, of offering expenses, from these sales. 
 We generally use net proceeds from these ATM offerings to make investments, to pay down liabilities and for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, shares representing approximately 258.0 million of our common stock remain available for issuance and sale under the Distribution Agreement. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Agreements 
 We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding commitments to third parties to fund investments totaling 277.4 million and 156.8 million, respectively, under various undrawn revolving credit facilities, delayed draw commitments or other future funding commitments. 
 We may from time to time enter into financing commitment letters or bridge financing commitments, which could require funding in the future. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had commitment letters to purchase investments in an aggregate par amount of 87.6 million and 11.1 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had not entered into any bridge financing commitments which could require funding in the future.

 We have entered into an investment management and advisory agreement (the "Investment Management Agreement") with the Investment Adviser in accordance with the 1940 Act. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser has agreed to provide us with investment advisory and management services. We have agreed to pay for these services (1) a management fee and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance. 
 We have also entered into the administration agreement, as amended and restated (the "Administration Agreement") with the Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator has agreed to arrange office space for us and provide office equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services and other administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations. The Administrator has also agreed to maintain, or oversee the maintenance of, our financial records, our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. 
 If any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that are entered into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under the Investment Management Agreement and the Administration Agreement.

 Related Parties 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 We have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. Therefore, New Mountain Capital is entitled to any profits earned by the Investment Adviser, which includes any fees payable to the Investment Adviser under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, less expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing its services under the Investment Management Agreement. 
 We have entered into a fee waiver agreement (the "Fee Waiver Agreement") with the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser agreed to voluntarily reduce the base management fees payable to the Investment Adviser by us under the Investment Management Agreement beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2021 through the quarter ending December 31, 2024. See Item 1 Financial Statements Note 5. Agreements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details. 
 We have entered into the Administration Agreement with the Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. The Administrator arranges our office space and provides office equipment and administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations pursuant to the Administration Agreement. We reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations to us under the Administration Agreement, which includes the fees and expenses associated with performing administrative, finance, and compliance functions, and the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement and further restricted by us, the Administrator may, in its own discretion, submit to us for reimbursement some or all of the expenses that the Administrator has incurred on our behalf during any quarterly period. As a result, the amount of expenses for which we will have to reimburse the Administrator may fluctuate in future quarterly periods and there can be no assurance given as to when, or if, the Administrator may determine to limit the expenses that the Administrator submits to us for reimbursement in the future. However, it is expected that the Administrator will continue to support part of our expense burden in the near future and may decide to not calculate and charge through certain overhead related amounts as well as continue to cover some of the indirect costs. The Administrator cannot recoup any expenses that the Administrator has previously waived. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 approximately 0.6 million and 1.8 million, respectively, of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, of which no expenses were waived by the Administrator. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 0.6 million of indirect administrative expenses were included in payable to affiliates. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the reimbursement to the Administrator represented approximately 0.02 and 0.05 , respectively, of our gross assets. 
 We, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator have entered into a royalty-free Trademark License Agreement, as amended, with New Mountain Capital, pursuant to which New Mountain Capital has agreed to grant us, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name "New Mountain" and "New Mountain Finance", as well as the NMF logo. 
 In addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our officers and directors, which is available on our website at www.newmountainfinance.com. These officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by the 1940 Act and the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to our investment mandates. The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Investment Adviser's allocation procedures. On October 8, 2019, the SEC issued an exemptive order (the Exemptive Order ), which superseded a prior order issued on December 18, 2017, which permits us to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain funds or entities managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, subject to the conditions of the Exemptive Order. Pursuant to the Exemptive Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then-current investment objective and strategies. The Exemptive Order was amended on August 30, 2022 to permit us to complete follow-on

 investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds do not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company, subject to certain conditions. 
 On March 30, 2020, an affiliate of the Investment Adviser purchased directly from NMNLC 105,030 shares of NMNLC s common stock at a price of 107.73 per share, which represented the net asset value per share of NMNLC at the date of purchase, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 11.3 million. Immediately thereafter, NMNLC redeemed 105,030 shares of its common stock held by NMFC in exchange for a promissory note with a principal amount of 11.3 million and a 7.0 interest rate, which was repaid by NMNLC to NMFC on March 31, 2020. Effective July 1, 2024, NMNLC purchased 63,575 shares of NMNLC's common stock from an affiliate of the Investment Adviser at remaining original cost, a price of 73.39 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 4.7 million. Immediately thereafter, NMNLC sold the 63,575 shares of its common stock to NMFC at remaining original cost, a price of 73.39 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 4.7 million. 
 On March 30, 2020, we entered into the Uncommitted Revolving Loan Agreement with NMF Investments III, L.L.C., an affiliate of the Investment Adviser, with a 30.0 million maximum amount of revolver borrowings available and a maturity date of December 31, 2022. On May 4, 2020, we entered into an Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Loan Agreement with NMF Investments III, L.L.C., which increased the maximum amounts of revolving borrowings available thereunder from 30.0 million to 50.0 million. On December 17, 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Loan Agreement with NMF Investments III, L.L.C., which lowered the interest rate and extended the maturity date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. On October 31, 2023, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Loan Agreement with NMF Investments III, L.L.C., which increased the maximum amount of revolving borrowings thereunder from 50.0 million to 100.0 million, extended the maturity date from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2027 and changed the interest rate to the Applicable Federal Rate. Refer to Item 1 Financial Statements Note 7. Borrowings for discussion of the Unsecured Management Company Revolver.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to certain financial market risks, such as interest rate fluctuations. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. From March 2022 to July 2023, the Federal Reserve was periodically raising interest rates to combat inflation and maintained the same rate benchmark from July 2023 to September 2024. While the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate in the third quarter of 2024 for the first time since March 2020 and indicated that there may be additional rate cuts in 2024, future reductions to benchmark rates are not certain. In a high interest rate environment, our net investment income would increase due to an increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. However, our cost of funds would also increase, which could also impact net investment income. It is possible that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle could result in a recession in the United States, which would likely decrease interest rates. Alternatively, in a prolonged low interest rate environment, including a reduction of base rates, such as SONIA or SOFR, to zero, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net interest income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, certain of the loans held in our portfolio had floating SOFR, SONIA, EURIBOR or Prime interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 84.94 of our investments at fair value (excluding investments on non-accrual, unfunded debt investments and non-interest bearing equity investments) represent floating-rate investments with a SOFR, SONIA or EURIBOR floor (includes investments bearing prime interest rate contracts) and approximately 15.06 of investments at fair value represent fixed-rate investments. Additionally, our senior secured revolving credit facilities are also subject to floating interest rates and are currently paid based on floating SOFR, SONIA or EURIBOR rates. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in interest income, net of interest expense, should interest rates decrease by 200, 150, 100 or 50 basis points, or increase by 50, 100, 150 or 200 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our portfolio of investments held on September 30, 2024. Interest expense is calculated based on the terms of our outstanding revolving credit facilities, convertible notes and unsecured notes. For our credit facilities, we use the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. This analysis does not take into account the impact of the incentive fee or other expenses. These hypothetical calculations are based on a model of the investments in our portfolio, held as of September 30, 2024, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates. 
 Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table. 
 Change in Interest Rates Estimated Percentage Change in Interest Income Net of Interest Expense (unaudited) -200 Basis Points (14.16) -150 Basis Points (10.62) -100 Basis Points (7.08) -50 Basis Points (3.54) +50 Basis Points 3.54 +100 Basis Points 7.08 +150 Basis Points 10.62 +200 Basis Points 14.16

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 Management has not identified any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 The terms we , us , our and the Company refers to New Mountain Finance Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We, our consolidated subsidiaries, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator are not currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings as of September 30, 2024. From time to time, we or our consolidated subsidiaries may be a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business including the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We may be subject to additional risks if we invest in foreign securities. 
 The 1940 Act generally requires that 70.0 of our investments be in issuers each of whom is, among other things, organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in the United States. Our investment strategy does not presently contemplate significant investments in securities of non-U.S. companies. However, we may desire to make such investments in the future, to the extent that such transactions and investments are permitted under the 1940 Act and any other applicable laws. We expect that these investments would focus on the same types of investments that we make in U.S. middle market companies and accordingly would be complementary to our overall strategy and enhance the diversity of our holdings. Investing in foreign companies could expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies. These risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the U.S., higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility. Investments denominated in foreign currencies would be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we can offer no assurance that we will, in fact, hedge currency risk, or that if we do, such strategies will be effective. 
 Hedging using derivatives may impact investment performance . 
 We may use over-the-counter (OTC) and cleared derivatives to hedge against fluctuations of the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in market interest rates or currency exchange rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions would not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of the positions declined. However, such hedging could establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. 
 Hedging transactions may limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions increased. Moreover, it might not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that was so generally anticipated that we would not be able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price. If we choose to engage in hedging transactions, there can be no assurances that we will achieve the intended benefits of such transactions and, depending on the degree of exposure such transactions could create, such transactions may expose us to risk of loss. 
 While we may enter into derivatives transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates could result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged could vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we might not seek to establish a perfect correlation between the hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any imperfect correlation could prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of 
 138 

Table of Contents 

 loss. In addition, it might not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities would likely fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations. 
 Our ability to enter into transactions involving derivatives and unfunded commitment transactions may be limited. 
 In 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 18f-4 under the 1940 Act, which relates to the use of derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations by BDCs (and other funds that are registered investment companies). Under Rule 18f-4, for which compliance was required beginning in August 2022, BDCs that use derivatives are subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit, certain derivatives risk management program and testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These new requirements apply unless the BDC qualifies as a limited derivatives user, as defined in Rule 18f-4. A BDC that enters into reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions could either (i) comply with the asset coverage requirements of Section 18, as modified by Section 61 of the 1940 Act, when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements or (ii) choose to treat such agreements as derivatives transactions under Rule 18f-4. In addition, under Rule 18f-4, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. If the BDC cannot meet this requirement, it is required to treat the unfunded commitment as a derivatives transaction subject to the aforementioned requirements of Rule 18f-4. 
 We qualify as a limited derivatives user for purposes of Rule 18f-4 and as a result the requirements applicable to us under Rule 18f-4 may limit our ability to use derivatives and enter into certain other financial contracts. However, if we fail to qualify as a limited derivatives user and become subject to the additional requirements under Rule 18f-4, compliance with such requirements may increase cost of doing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Valuing OTC derivatives may be less certain than actively traded financial instruments. 
 In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because, for OTC derivatives, the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources. In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction. As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction. 
 Our rights under an OTC derivative may be restricted by regulations. 
 Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators that are now in effect require certain prudentially regulated entities and certain of their affiliates and subsidiaries (including swap dealers) to include in their derivatives contracts and certain other financial contracts terms that delay or restrict the rights of counterparties to terminate such contracts, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the prudentially regulated entity and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types of resolution or insolvency proceedings. Similar regulations and laws have been adopted in non-U.S. jurisdictions that may apply to any of our counterparties that located in those jurisdictions. It is possible that these new requirements, as well as potential additional resulted government regulation, could adversely affect our ability to terminate existing derivatives contracts, exercise default rights, or satisfy obligations owed to us with collateral received under such contracts. 
 The use of OTC derivatives may expose us to early termination risk, which could result in significant losses. 
 OTC derivatives do not have uniform terms. An OTC derivatives counterparty may have the right to close out our position due to the occurrence of certain events (for example, if a counterparty is unable to hedge its obligations to us, or if we defaults on certain terms of the OTC swaps agreement, or if there is a material decline in our NAV on a particular day) and request immediate payment of amounts owed by us under the agreement. If the level of our NAV has a dramatic intraday move, the terms of our OTC derivatives document may permit the counterparty to early close out a transaction with us at a price calculated by the counterparty that, in good faith, represents such counterparty s loss, which may not represent fair market value. An OTC derivatives counterparty may also have the right to close out our position for no reason, in some cases with same day notice.

Each Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of the Borrower with such Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(f), by remittance to such Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., New York time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan. (c) Refunding of Swingline Loans. With respect to any Swingline Loans which have not been repaid by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.09 or voluntarily prepaid by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.10, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of such Swingline Lender, shall request settlement Settlement with the Lenders on a weekly basis (or on a more frequent basis if so determined by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Swingline Lender), no later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least one Business Day in advance of the proposed date of such requested Settlement (the date of such requested Settlement being the Settlement Date ).

Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (1) the proceeds of such Refunding Loans made by the Lenders other than such Swingline Lender shall be immediately delivered by Administrative Agent to such Swingline Lender (and not to the Borrower) and applied to repay a corresponding portion of the Refunded Swingline Loans and (2) 

62 770580030 on the day such Refunding Loans are made, such Swingline Lender s pro rata share of the Refunded Swingline Loans shall be deemed to be paid with the proceeds of a Refunding Loan made by such Swingline Lender to Borrower, and such portion of the Swingline Loans deemed to be so paid shall no longer be outstanding as Swingline Loans but shall instead constitute part of such Swingline Lender s outstanding Multicurrency Loans or Dollar Loans, as applicable, to the Borrower. If any portion of any such amount paid (or deemed to be paid) to such Swingline Lender should be recovered by or on behalf of the Borrower from such Swingline Lender in bankruptcy, by assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all Lenders in the manner contemplated by Section 2.17. (d) Participations by Lenders in Swingline Loans. If for any reason Refunding Loans are not made pursuant to Section 2.04(c) above in an amount sufficient to repay the Refunded Swingline Loans on or before the third Business Day after demand for payment thereof by such Swingline Lender, each Lender holding a Revolving Credit Exposure (other than Non- Extending Lenders for which such Non-Extending Lender s applicable Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date shall have occurred; provided that the foregoing will not release any Non-Extending Lender from any such obligation to acquire or fund participations in Swingline Loans, in each case, that was required to be performed on or prior to the Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date for such Non-Extending Lender) shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have purchased a participation in such outstanding Swingline Loans, and in an amount equal to its Applicable Multicurrency Percentage or Applicable Dollar Percentage of the applicable unpaid amount together with accrued interest thereon. Upon one Business Day s notice from such Swingline Lender, each Lender holding a Revolving Credit Exposure shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of such Swingline Lender, an amount equal to its respective participation in the applicable unpaid amount as provided below. In order to evidence such participation each Lender holding a Revolving Credit Exposure agrees to enter into a participation agreement at the request of such Swingline Lender in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Swingline Lender. In the event any Lender holding a Revolving Credit Exposure fails to make available to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of such Swingline Lender, the amount of such Lender s participation as provided in this paragraph, such Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender at the Alternate Base Rate. Subject to the foregoing, each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph (d) is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments of the respective Class, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the relevant Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by a Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by such Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations 63 770580030 therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the applicable Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof. (e) Resignation and Replacement of Swingline Lender. Any Swingline Lender may resign and be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the resigning Swingline Lender and a successor Swingline Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such resignation and replacement of any Swingline Lender. In addition to the foregoing, if a Lender becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, and if any Default has arisen from a failure of the Borrower to comply with Section 2.19(a), then each Swingline Lender may, upon prior written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, resign as a Swingline Lender, effective at the close of business New York time on a date specified in such notice (which date may not be less than five (5) Business Days after the date of such notice). On or after the effective date of any such resignation, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may, by written agreement, appoint one or more successor Swingline Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such appointment of a successor Swingline Lender. Upon the effectiveness of any resignation of any Swingline Lender, the Borrower shall repay in full all outstanding Swingline Loans together with all accrued interest thereon. From and after the effective date of the appointment of a successor Swingline Lender, (i) such successor Swingline Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Swingline Lender under this Agreement with respect to Swingline Loans to be made thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Swingline Lender shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Swingline Lender, or to such successor and all previous Swingline Lenders, as the context shall require. After the replacement of the Swingline Lender hereunder, the replaced Swingline Lender shall have no obligation to make additional Swingline Loans. (f) Designation of Additional Swingline Lenders. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), designate as additional Swingline Lenders one (1) or more Lenders with Revolving Credit Exposure that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below. The acceptance by a Lender with Revolving Credit Exposure of an appointment as a Swingline Lender hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement, which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such designated Lender and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of a Swingline Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein or therein to the term Swingline Lender shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as a maker of Swingline Loans hereunder; provided that each such agreement shall include an updated Schedule 2.05; provided, further, that the Borrower shall not update Schedule 2.05 to increase any Swingline Lender s maximum Swingline Exposure without such Swingline Lender s consent. 64 770580030 SECTION 2.05. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, in addition to the Loans provided for in Section 2.01, the Borrower may request any Issuing Bank to issue, at any time and from time to time at least thirty (30) days prior to the Extended Commitment Termination Date, during the Extended Availability Period and under either the Dollar Commitments or Multicurrency Commitments, Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or (in the case of Letters of Credit under the Multicurrency Commitments) in any Agreed Foreign Currency for its own account in such form as is acceptable to such Issuing Bank in its sole discretion. Each requested Letter of Credit must satisfy the requirements of this Agreement (unless waived to the extent permitted by this Agreement) and such Issuing Bank's internal policies, forms and procedures (unless waived by such Issuing Bank). Letters of Credit issued hereunder shall constitute utilization of the Commitments up to the aggregate amount available to be drawn thereunder. Without limiting any rights of an Issuing Bank under this Section 2.05, no Issuing Bank shall be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit that is not a standby letter of credit. (b) Notice of Issuance or Amendment. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by such Issuing Bank) to any Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (at least three (3) Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit or amendment, and specifying the date of issuance or amendment (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (d) of this Section), the amount and Currency of such Letter of Credit, whether such Letter of Credit is to be issued under the Dollar Commitments or the Multicurrency Commitments, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare such Letter of Credit or amendment. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit to such Issuing Bank a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank s standard forms in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, such Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. (c) Limitations on Amounts. A Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, only if (and upon issuance or amendment of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance or amendment (i) the aggregate LC Exposure of the Issuing Banks (determined for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the Lenders pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section) shall not exceed 50,000,000, (ii) the total Revolving Dollar Credit Exposures of Dollar Lenders with Dollar Commitments then in effect shall not exceed the aggregate Dollar Commitments at such time, (iii) the total Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures of Multicurrency Lenders with Multicurrency Commitments then in effect shall not exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments at such time, (iv) with respect to each Issuing Bank that is a Swingline Lender with a Multicurrency Commitment, the sum of such Swingline Lender s outstanding Multicurrency Loans, its Multicurrency LC Exposure, its outstanding Swingline Loans and (without duplication) its other Swingline Exposure shall not exceed its Multicurrency Commitment then in effect, (v) with respect 65 770580030 to each Issuing Bank that is a Swingline Lender with a Dollar Commitment, the sum of such Swingline Lender s outstanding Dollar Loans, its Dollar LC Exposure, its outstanding Swingline Loans and (without duplication) its other Swingline Exposure shall not exceed its Dollar Commitment then in effect, (vi) the LC Exposure of the applicable Issuing Bank requested to issue such Letter of Credit (determined for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the Lenders pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section) shall not exceed the amount set forth opposite the name of such Issuing Bank on Schedule 2.05 and (vii) the total Covered Debt Amount shall not exceed the Borrowing Base then in effect. The minimum initial amount of each Letter of Credit shall be 250,000 and no more than ten (10) Letters of Credit may be outstanding at any one time. (d) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall provide that it expires within one year from the date of issuance. If a Letter of Credit also provides for automatic extension, such Letter of Credit must also provide for automatic expiration at the initial or any subsequent expiration date upon such Issuing Bank's sending a notice of non-extension to the beneficiary reasonably before the then current expiration date, that no automatic extension may exceed one year in duration, and that the Letter of Credit must in all events expire on a final and certain date stated in the Letter of Credit that is not later than ten (10) days prior to the Extended Commitment Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Letter of Credit is outstanding following the earlier to occur of the Extended Commitment Termination Date and the Termination Date, the Letter of Credit must be Cash Collateralized in an amount of at least 102 of the undrawn face amount and any unreimbursed drawings not honored or refused of each Letter of Credit on terms acceptable to such Issuing Bank, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Extended Commitment Termination Date or Termination Date, as applicable, or supported by another letter of credit approved by such Issuing Bank, and (ii) the Borrower pays in full prior to the Extended Commitment Termination Date all commissions, fees and expenses required to be paid with respect to any such Letter of Credit through the then current expiration date of such Letter of Credit (and, in that connection, the Lenders agree not later than the date two Business Days after the date upon which the last such Letter of Credit shall expire or be terminated to rebate to the Borrower the excess, if any, of the aggregate participation and fronting fees that have been prepaid by the Borrower over the sum of the amount of such fees that ultimately accrue through the date of such expiration or termination and the aggregate amount of all other unpaid obligations hereunder at such time), in each case pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent. (e) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit of a Class of Commitment (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by any Issuing Bank, and without any further action on the part of such Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grant to each Lender (other than any Non-Extending Lender for which such Non- Extending Lender s applicable Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date has occurred; provided that the foregoing will not release any Non-Extending Lender from any such obligation to acquire or fund participations in Letters of Credit, in each case, that was required to be performed on or prior to the Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date for such Non- Extending Lender) of such Class, and each Lender of such Class hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender s Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage, as the case may be, of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to 

66 770580030 acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the applicable Commitments; provided that no Lender shall be required to purchase a participation in a Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.05(e) if (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 would not be satisfied in respect of a Borrowing at the time such Letter of Credit was issued and (y) the Required Lenders of the respective Class shall have so notified such Issuing Bank in writing at least two (2) Business Days prior to the requested date of issuance of such Letter of Credit and shall not have subsequently determined that the circumstances giving rise to such conditions not being satisfied no longer exist. Unless an Issuing Bank has received written notice from the Required Lenders of the Respective Class or the Borrower, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the requested date of issuance of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Section 4.02 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to assume all such conditions are satisfied. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender of a Class (other than any Non-Extending Lender for which such Non-Extending Lender s applicable Non- Extended Commitment Termination Date has occurred; provided that that foregoing will not release any Non-Extending Lender from any such obligation to acquire or fund participations in Letters of Credit, in each case, that was required to be performed on or prior to the Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date for such Non-Extending Lender) hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of each Issuing Bank, such Lender s Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage, as the case may be, of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank in respect of Letters of Credit of such Class promptly upon the request of such Issuing Bank at any time from the time of such LC Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to the next following paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. (f) Reimbursement. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank in respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to such Issuing Bank an amount equal to such LC Disbursement in the Currency in which such Letter of Credit is denominated not later than 3:00 p.m., New York time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 11:00 a.m., New York time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to 67 770580030 such time; provided that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than 100,000 and is denominated in Dollars, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with a Syndicated ABR Borrowing or a Swingline Loan of the respective Class in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Syndicated ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan and in the event the Borrower elects to finance the LC Disbursement, the Administrative Agent shall pay to such Issuing Bank the proceeds of such Loan. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due and does not request and receive a Syndicated ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan in the unpaid amount pursuant to Section 2.05(f) hereof, the Administrative Agent shall notify each applicable Lender with a Commitment then in effect of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender s Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage, as the case may be, thereof. (g) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit, and (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower s obligations hereunder. None of the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders, the Issuing Banks or any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the Issuing Banks or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Banks; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank s fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgement. The parties hereto expressly agree that: (i) the Issuing Banks may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make 68 770580030 payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (ii) the Issuing Banks shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and (iii) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by the Issuing Banks when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing). (h) Disbursement Procedures. Each Issuing Bank shall, within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the applicable Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. (i) Interim Interest. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Syndicated ABR Loans; provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement within two Business Days following the date when due pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section, then the provisions of Section 2.12(c) shall apply automatically without further action by the Lenders. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. (j) Resignation and/or Replacement of an Issuing Bank. Any Issuing Bank may resign and be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the resigning Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. In addition, if any Issuing Bank, in its capacity as a Lender, assigns all of its Loans and Commitments in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing Bank hereunder upon not less than thirty days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such resignation and replacement of an Issuing Bank. Upon the effectiveness of any resignation of an Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for account of the resigning Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of the appointment of a successor Issuing Bank, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any 69 770580030 previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the effective resignation of any Issuing Bank hereunder, the resigning Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or amend outstanding Letters of Credit (k) Cash Collateralization. If the Borrower shall be required to provide Cash Collateral for LC Exposure pursuant to Section 2.05(d), Section 2.10(b) or (c) or the last paragraph of Article VII, the Borrower shall promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business Days, deposit into a segregated collateral account or accounts (herein, collectively, the Letter of Credit Collateral Account in the name and under the dominion and control of such Issuing Bank Cash denominated in the Currency of the Letter of Credit under which such LC Exposure arises in an amount equal to the amount required under Section 2.05(d), Section 2.10(b) or (c) or the last paragraph of Article VII, as applicable. Such deposit shall be held by such Issuing Bank or its agent as collateral in the first instance for the LC Exposure under this Agreement and thereafter for the payment of the Secured Obligations under and as defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement, and for these purposes the Borrower hereby grants a security interest (subject only to Liens of the type described in clause (g) of the definition of Permitted Liens and unrecorded Liens permitted hereunder which have priority over the Liens on the Collateral by operation of law) to such Issuing Bank in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and in any financial assets (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) or other property held therein. If the Borrower is required to provide Cash Collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such Cash Collateral (to the extent not applied as set forth in this Section 2.05(k)) shall be returned to the Borrower promptly after all Events of Default have been waived. If the Borrower is required to provide Cash Collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(ii), such Cash Collateral (to the extent not applied as set forth in this Section 2.05(k)) shall be returned to the Borrower promptly as and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures would not exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments. (l) No Obligation to Issue After Certain Events. No Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to issue, amend, reinstate or extend any Letter of Credit if: any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing, amending, reinstating or extending such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to such Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Bank shall refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Effective Date and which such Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it, or the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally. (m) Applicability of ISP and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Issuing Banks and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, (i) the rules of the International 

70 770580030 Standby Practices shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit. (n) Additional Issuing Banks. From time to time, the Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent, designate one or more additional Lenders with Revolving Credit Exposure as an Issuing Bank, so long as each such Lender agrees (in its sole discretion) to act in such capacity and is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; provided that each such notice shall include an updated Schedule 2.05; provided, further, that the Borrower shall not update Schedule 2.05 to increase any Issuing Bank s maximum LC Exposure without such Issuing Bank s consent. Each such additional Issuing Bank shall execute a counterpart of this Agreement upon the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and shall thereafter be an Issuing Bank hereunder for all purposes. SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Funding by Lenders. Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder by wire transfer of immediately available funds by (i) 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the date of Borrowing specified in the applicable Borrowing Request for any Loan denominated in Dollars or Canadian Dollars, (ii) 9:00 a.m., New York time, on the date of Borrowing specified in the applicable Borrowing Request for any Loan denominated in English Pounds Sterling or Euros, or (iii) 6:00 p.m., New York time, on the date before the date of Borrowing specified in the applicable Borrowing Notice for any Loan denominated in Australian Dollars, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that Syndicated ABR Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(f) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank. (b) Presumption by the Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree that the Administrative Agent may recover such corresponding amount with interest thereon for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent as follows: (a) in the case of such Lender, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate; or (b) in the case of the Borrower, at the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Nothing in this paragraph shall relieve any Lender of its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder, and this paragraph shall be without prejudice 71 770580030 to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections. (a) Elections by the Borrower for Syndicated Borrowings. Subject to Section 2.03(d), the Loans constituting each Syndicated Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, shall have the Interest Period specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, may elect the Interest Period therefor, all as provided in this Section; provided, however, that (i) a Syndicated Borrowing of a Class may only be continued or converted into a Syndicated Borrowing of the same Class, (ii) except as set forth in Sections 2.13, 2.20(e) and 2.21, a Syndicated Borrowing denominated in one Currency may not be continued as, or converted to, a Syndicated Borrowing in a different Currency, (iii) no Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may be continued if, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures would exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments, and (iv) neither a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency nor a RFR Borrowing may not be converted to a Borrowing of a different Type. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders of the respective Class holding the Loans constituting such Borrowing, and the Loans constituting each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued. (b) Notice of Elections. To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election in writing by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Syndicated Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower. (c) Content of Interest Election Requests. Each Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: (i) the Borrowing (including the Class of Commitment) to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) whether, in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Term Benchmark Borrowing; and 72 770580030 (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Interest Period therefor after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period and permitted under Section 2.02(d). (d) Notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders. Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender s portion of each resulting Borrowing. (e) Failure to Elect; Events of Default. If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely and complete Interest Election Request with respect to a Term Benchmark Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, (i) if such Borrowing is denominated in Dollars, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to a Syndicated Term Benchmark Borrowing of the same Class having an Interest Period of one month, and (ii) if such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month s duration. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, (i) any Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall, at the end of the applicable Interest Period for such Term Benchmark Borrowing, be automatically converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) any Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency shall not have an Interest Period of more than one month s duration. SECTION 2.08. Termination, Reduction or Increase of the Commitments. (a) Scheduled Termination. Unless previously terminated, the Commitments of each Extending Lender with respect to such Extending Lender s Extended Loans shall terminate on the Extended Commitment Termination Date and the Commitments of each Non-Extending Lender with respect to such Non-Extending Lender s Non-Extended Loans shall terminate on the Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date for such Non-Extending Lender; provided that the foregoing will not release any Non-Extending Lender from any such obligation to make Loans to the Borrower, or acquire or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans, in each case, that was required to be performed on or prior to the Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date for such Non-Extending Lender. (b) Voluntary Termination or Reduction. The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments of either Class of Commitment, ratably among the Lenders of such Class of Commitment; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments of a Class shall be in an amount that is 5,000,000 (or, if less, the entire amount of the Commitments of such Class) or a larger multiple of 1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments of either Class of Commitment if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Syndicated Loans of such Class in accordance with Section 2.10, the total Revolving Credit Exposures of such Class would exceed the total Commitments of such Class. Any such reduction of the Commitments below the principal amount of the Swingline Loans permitted under Section 2.04(a)(i) and the Letters of Credit permitted under Section 2.05(c)(i) shall result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction of such amounts as applicable. 73 770580030 (c) Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments of a Class delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or a transaction contemplated by Section 2.10(d), in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. (d) Effect of Termination or Reduction. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of a Class of Commitments pursuant to clause (b) shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of a Class of Commitments pursuant to clause (b) shall be made ratably among the Lenders of such Class (including with respect to (x) Dollar Lenders and Multicurrency Lenders and (y) Extending Lenders and Non-Extending Lenders) in accordance with their respective Commitments. (e) Increase of the Commitments. (i) Requests for Increase by Borrower. The Borrower may, at any time, request that the Commitments hereunder of a Class of Commitments be increased (each such proposed increase being a Commitment Increase ), upon notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders), which notice shall specify each existing Lender (each an Increasing Lender and/or each additional lender (each an Assuming Lender that shall have agreed to an additional Commitment and the date on which such increase is to be effective (the Commitment Increase Date ), which shall be a Business Day at least three Business Days (or such lesser period as the Administrative Agent may reasonably agree) after delivery of such notice and at least 30 days prior to the Extended Commitment Termination Date; provided that: (A) the minimum amount of the Commitment of any Assuming Lender, and the minimum amount of the increase of the Commitment of any Increasing Lender, as part of such Commitment Increase shall be 5,000,000 or a larger multiple of 1,000,000 in excess thereof (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may reasonably agree); (B) immediately after giving effect to such Commitment Increase (including, if applicable, the substantially concurrent reduction of the Commitments of a Non-Extending Lender in accordance with Section 2.08(f)), the total Commitments of all of the Lenders hereunder shall not exceed 790,000,000; (C) each Assuming Lender shall be consented to by the Administrative Agent, each Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld); 

74 770580030 (D) in the case of any Commitment Increase (other than a Commitment Increase used in connection with a Specified Purchase) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such Commitment Increase Date or shall result from the proposed Commitment Increase; and (E) (1) in the case of a Commitment Increase used in connection with a merger or consolidation with, or acquisition by an Obligor of all or substantially all of the assets of, any other business development company advised by the External Manager permitted under Section 6.03 (such Person, a Specified Target and such merger, consolidation or acquisition a Specified Purchase ), the Specified Representations (immediately after giving effect to such merger, consolidation or acquisition) and the Specified Purchase Agreement Representations (immediately prior to giving effect to such merger, consolidation or acquisition) shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such Commitment Increase Date, or (2) in the case of any other Commitment Increase, the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects (or, in the case of any portion of the representations and warranties already subject to a materiality qualifier, true and correct in all respects) on and as of the Commitment Increase Date as if made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date). (ii) Effectiveness of Commitment Increase by Borrower. An Assuming Lender, if any, shall become a Lender hereunder as of such Commitment Increase Date and the Commitment of the respective Class of any Increasing Lender and such Assuming Lender shall be increased as of such Commitment Increase Date; provided that: (x) the Administrative Agent shall have received on or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York time, on such Commitment Increase Date (or on or prior to a time on an earlier date specified by the Administrative Agent) a certificate of a duly authorized officer of the Borrower stating that each of the applicable conditions to such Commitment Increase set forth in clauses (D) and (E) of the foregoing paragraph (i) has been satisfied; and (y) each Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent, on or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York time on such Commitment Increase Date (or on or prior to a time on an earlier date specified by the Administrative Agent) (each, a Increasing Lender/Joining Lender Agreement ), an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which such Lender shall, effective as of such Commitment Increase Date, undertake a Commitment or an increase of Commitment in each case of the respective Class, duly executed by such Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender, as applicable, and the Borrower and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent. Promptly following satisfaction of such conditions, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of such Class (including any Assuming Lenders) thereof and of the occurrence 75 770580030 of the Commitment Increase Date by facsimile transmission or electronic messaging system.

(iv) Adjustments of Borrowings upon Effectiveness of Increase. On the Commitment Increase Date, the Borrower shall (A) prepay the outstanding Loans (if any) of the affected Class of Commitments in full, (B) simultaneously borrow new Loans of such Class hereunder in an amount equal to such prepayment; provided that with respect to subclauses (A) and (B), (x) the prepayment to, and borrowing from, any existing Lender shall be effected by book entry to the extent that any portion of the amount prepaid to such Lender will be subsequently borrowed from such Lender and (y) the existing Lenders, the Increasing Lenders and the Assuming Lenders shall make and receive payments among themselves, in a manner acceptable to the Administrative Agent, so that, after giving effect thereto, the Loans of such Class are held ratably by the Lenders of such Class in accordance with the respective Commitments of such Class of such Lenders (after giving effect to such Commitment Increase) and (C) pay to the Lenders of such Class the amounts, if any, payable under Section 2.15 as a result of any such prepayment. Concurrently therewith, the Lenders of such Class shall be deemed to have adjusted their participation interests in any outstanding Letters of Credit of such Class so that such interests are held ratably in accordance with their Revolving Commitments of such Class as so increased. (v) Terms of Loans Issued on the Commitment Increase Date. The terms and provisions of any new Loans issued by any Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender, and the Commitment Increase of any Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender, shall be identical to the terms and provisions of Loans issued by, and the Commitments of, the Revolving Lenders immediately prior to the applicable Commitment Increase Date (except that any upfront or similar one-time fee may be different). (f) Reduction of Non-Extending Lenders Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including Section 2.08(d)): (i) The Borrower may at any time (x) terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitment of any Non-Extending Lender without reducing the Commitments of any other Lender of the same Class of Commitments of such Non-Extending Lender or (y) at any time after a Non-Extending Lender s Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date and so long as (1) no Event of Default exists, (2) no event or condition exists which, upon notice, lapse of time or both would, unless cured or waived, become an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Section 7.01 and (3) the Borrowing Base exceeds the Covered Debt Amount at such time, prepay the Loans of such Non-Extending Lender without prepaying the Loans of any other Lender of the same Class of Commitments of such Non-Extending Lender; provided that each reduction of the Commitment or prepayment of Loans of a Non-Extending Lender pursuant to this clause (f) shall be in an 76 770580030 amount that is 5,000,000 or a larger multiple of 1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in each case, the entire Commitment or outstanding Loans of such Non-Extending Lender, as applicable). (ii) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitment or prepay the Loans of any Non-Extending Lender under this clause (f) at least two Business Days (or such lesser period as the Administrative Agent may reasonably agree) prior to (x) the related Commitment Increase Date in the case of any termination or reduction or (y) the effective date of such prepayment, in each case, specifying such election and the related Commitment Increase Date or effective date thereof, as applicable. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this clause (f) shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination or reduction may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other events, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. (iii) Any termination or reduction of the Commitment or prepayment of Loans of any Non-Extending Lender pursuant to this clause (f) shall be permanent and, if applicable in connection with any termination or reduction of Commitments, shall be made concurrently with all required reallocations, prepayments and cash collateralizations required under Section 2.21; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, if any Loans or Letters of Credit are outstanding, no reduction or termination of Commitments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.08(f) if the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are not satisfied on the date of such reduction or termination. SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) Repayment. The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay the Loans of each Class of Commitments, as applicable, as follows: (i) to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders of such Class the outstanding principal amount of the Syndicated Loans of the Lenders of such Class and all other amounts due and owing hereunder and under the other Loan Documents on such Lenders applicable Final Maturity Date; and (ii) to the applicable Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan of such Class of Commitment denominated in Dollars made by such Swingline Lender, as provided in Section 2.04; provided that on each date that a Syndicated Borrowing of such Class of Commitment is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans of such Class of Commitment then outstanding. (b) Manner of Payment. Prior to any repayment or prepayment of any Borrowings to any Lenders of any Class of Commitment hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings of such Class to be paid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed in writing) of such selection not later than the time set forth in Section 2.10(e) prior to the scheduled date of such repayment; provided that each repayment of Borrowings 77 770580030 in Dollars to any Lenders of a Class shall be applied to repay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of such Class before any other Borrowings of such Class. If the Borrower fails to make a timely selection of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid or prepaid, such payment shall be applied to repay Borrowings in the same Currency and, solely in the case of any such payment in Dollars, first, to pay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of the applicable Class and, second, to other Borrowings of such Class in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first). Other than in connection with a reduction or termination of Commitments or prepayment of Loans pursuant to Section 2.08(f), the occurrence of the Final Maturity Date with respect to any Lender pursuant to Section 2.09(a) or a mandatory prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10(d), each payment of a Syndicated Borrowing to Lenders of a Class shall be applied ratably (both with respect to (x) Dollar Loans and Multicurrency Loans and (y) Extended Loans and Non-Extended Loans) to the Loans included in such Borrowing. (c) Maintenance of Records by Lenders. Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice records evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts and Currency of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. (d) Maintenance of Records by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall maintain records in which it shall record (i) the amount and Currency of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and each Interest Period therefor, (ii) the amount and Currency of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender of such Class of Commitment hereunder and (iii) the amount and Currency of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for account of the Lenders and each Lender s share thereof. (e) Effect of Entries. The entries made in the records maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence, absent obvious error, of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (f) Promissory Notes. Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be evidenced by a promissory note; in such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered permitted assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered, permitted assigns). SECTION 2.10. Prepayment of Loans. (a) Optional Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, without premium or penalty except 

78 770580030 for payments under Section 2.15, subject to the requirements of this Section. Any prepayment of a Borrowing made in accordance with this clause (a) shall be applied ratably among the Lenders of a Class of Commitment unless such prepayment is made in connection with the reduction of Commitments in accordance with Section 2.08(b) or 2.08(f) in which case such prepayment shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.08(d) or 2.08(f), as applicable. (b) Mandatory Prepayments due to Changes in Exchange Rates. (i) Determination of Amount Outstanding. On each Quarterly Date and, in addition, promptly upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent of a Currency Valuation Notice (as defined below), the Administrative Agent shall determine the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure. For the purpose of this determination, the outstanding principal amount of any Loan or Letter Credit that is denominated in any Foreign Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount in the Foreign Currency of such Loan or Letter of Credit, determined as of such Quarterly Date or, in the case of a Currency Valuation Notice received by the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., New York time, on a Business Day, on such Business Day or, in the case of a Currency Valuation Notice otherwise received, on the first Business Day after such Currency Valuation Notice is received. Upon making such determination, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Multicurrency Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower thereof. (ii) Prepayment. If on the date of such determination the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure minus the Multicurrency LC Exposure fully Cash Collateralized on such date exceeds 105 of the aggregate amount of the Multicurrency Commitments as then in effect, the Borrower shall, prepay the Syndicated Multicurrency Loans and Swingline Multicurrency Loans (and/or provide Cash Collateral for Multicurrency LC Exposure as specified in Section 2.05(k)) within 15 Business Days following the Borrower s receipt of such request in such amounts as shall be necessary so that after giving effect thereto the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure does not exceed the Multicurrency Commitments. For purposes hereof Current Valuation Notice means a notice given by the Required Multicurrency Lenders or the Issuing Banks to the Administrative Agent stating that such notice is a Currency Valuation Notice and requesting that the Administrative Agent determine the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to make more than one valuation determination pursuant to Currency Valuation Notices within any rolling three month period. Any prepayment pursuant to this paragraph shall be applied, first to Swingline Multicurrency Loans outstanding, second, to Syndicated Multicurrency Loans outstanding and third, as cover for Multicurrency LC Exposure. (c) Mandatory Prepayments due to Borrowing Base Deficiency. In the event that at any time any Borrowing Base Deficiency shall exist, the Borrower shall, within five Business Days after delivery of the applicable Borrowing Base Certificate, prepay the Loans (or provide Cash Collateral for Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.05(k)) or reduce Other 79 770580030 Covered Indebtedness or any other Indebtedness that is included in the Covered Debt Amount at such time or otherwise remedy the Borrowing Base Deficiency in such amounts as shall be necessary so that such Borrowing Base Deficiency is cured; provided that (i) the aggregate amount of such prepayment of Loans (and Cash Collateral for Letters of Credit) shall be at least equal to the Revolving Percentage times the aggregate prepayment of the Covered Debt Amount, and (ii) if, within five (5) Business Days after delivery of a Borrowing Base Certificate demonstrating such Borrowing Base Deficiency, the Borrower shall present the Administrative Agent with a reasonably feasible plan to enable such Borrowing Base Deficiency to be cured within 30 Business Days (which 30-Business Day period shall include the five Business Days permitted for delivery of such plan), then such prepayment or reduction shall not be required to be effected immediately but may be effected in accordance with such plan (with such modifications as the Borrower may reasonably determine), so long as such Borrowing Base Deficiency is cured within such 30- Business Day period. (d) Mandatory Prepayments During Amortization Period. During the period commencing on the date immediately following the Commitment Termination Date with respect to any Loans of any Lender or Lenders and ending on the Final Maturity Date with respect to the Loans of such Lender or Lenders: (i) Asset Disposition. If the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than a Financing Subsidiary) Disposes of any property which results in the receipt by such Person of Net Cash Proceeds in excess of 5,000,000 in the aggregate since the applicable Commitment Termination Date, the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of such Loans owed to such Lender or Lenders equal to 100 of such Net Cash Proceeds no later than the fifth Business Day following the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in Section 2.09(b)); (ii) Equity Issuance. Upon the sale or issuance by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than a Financing Subsidiary) of any of its Equity Interests (other than any sales or issuances of Equity Interests to the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of such Loans owed to such Lender or Lenders equal to 75 of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom no later than the fifth Business Day following the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in Section 2.09(b)); (iii) Indebtedness. Upon the incurrence or issuance by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than a Financing Subsidiary) of any Indebtedness (excluding any Permitted Advisor Loan or the making of any Loans or issuance of any Letters of Credit hereunder), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of such Loans owed to such Lender or Lenders equal to 100 of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom no later than the fifth Business Day following the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in Section 2.09(b)); (iv) Extraordinary Receipt. Upon any Extraordinary Receipt (which, when taken with all other Extraordinary Receipts received after the applicable Commitment Termination Date, exceeds 5,000,000 in the aggregate) received by or paid to or for the account of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than a Financing Subsidiary), and 80 770580030 not otherwise included in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 2.10(d), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of such Loans owed to such Lender or Lenders equal to 100 of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom no later than the fifth Business Day following the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in Section 2.09(b)); and (v) Return of Capital.

Until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Syndicated Borrowing to, or the continuation of any Syndicated Borrowing as, a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in the Affected Currency shall be ineffective and, if the Affected Currency is Dollars, such Syndicated Borrowing (unless prepaid) shall be continued as, or converted to, a Syndicated ABR Borrowing at the end of the applicable Interest Period, (ii) if the Affected Currency is Dollars and any Borrowing Request requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as a Syndicated ABR Borrowing, (iii) if the Affected Currency is a Foreign Currency other than Canadian Dollars, (A) any Borrowing Request that requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing denominated in the Affected Currency shall be made as a Term Benchmark Borrowing with a Relevant Rate equal to the Central Bank Rate for the 85 770580030 applicable Agreed Foreign Currency; provided, that if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency cannot be determined, such Borrowing Request shall be ineffective, and (B) any outstanding Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing in the Affected Currency, at the Borrower s election shall either (1) be converted to a Syndicated Borrowing bearing interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency cannot be determined, such Borrowing shall be converted into a Syndicated ABR Borrowing denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Affected Currency) immediately in the case of an RFR Borrowing or, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, at the end of the applicable Interest Period, (2) be converted into a Syndicated ABR Borrowing denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Affected Currency) immediately in the case of an RFR Borrowing or, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, at the end of the applicable Interest Period, or (3) be prepaid in full immediately in the case of an RFR Borrowing or, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, at the end of the applicable Interest Period, and (iv) if the Affected Currency is Canadian Dollars, (A) any Borrowing Request that requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Canadian Dollars shall be made as a Term Benchmark Borrowing with a Relevant Rate equal to the Canadian Prime Rate; provided, that if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Canadian Prime Rate cannot be determined, such Borrowing Request shall be ineffective, and (B) any outstanding Term Benchmark Borrowing in Canadian Dollars, at the Borrower s election, shall either (1) be converted to a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Canadian Dollars with a Relevant Rate equal to the Canadian Prime Rate at the end of applicable Interest Period; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines, which determination shall be conclusive and biding absent manifest error) that the Canadian Prime Rate cannot be determined, such Borrowing shall be converted into a Syndicated ABR Borrowing denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Affected Currency) at the end of the applicable Interest Period, (2) be converted into a Syndicated ABR Borrowing denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Affected Currency) at the end of the applicable Interest Period, or (3) be prepaid in full at the end of the applicable Interest Period; provided that if no election is made by the Borrower by the date that is three Business Days after receipt by the Borrower of such notice or, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Term Benchmark Loan, if earlier, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected clause (iii)(B)(1) or (iv)(B)(1) above, as applicable. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document (and any Hedging Agreement shall be deemed not to be a Loan Document for purposes of this Section 2.13), if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then- current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with any of clauses (1) through (4) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined 

86 770580030 in accordance with clause (5) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders of each affected Class. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document and subject to the proviso below in this paragraph, with respect to a Loan denominated in Euros, if a Term ESTR Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, as applicable, have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then the applicable Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder or under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, this clause (c) shall not be effective unless the Administrative Agent has delivered to the Lenders and the Borrower a Term ESTR Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to deliver any Term ESTR Notice after the occurrence of a Term ESTR Transition Event, and may do so in its sole discretion. (d) In connection with the implementation and administration of a Benchmark Replacement or Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement. (e) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes, (iii) the commencement of a Benchmark Transition Event and (iv) the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.13, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.13. (f) At any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR or Term ESTR), then the Administrative Agent may remove any tenor of such Benchmark that is unavailable or non-representative for Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement) settings and (ii) the Administrative Agent may reinstate any such previously removed tenor for Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement) settings. 87 770580030 (g) Upon the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, in an Affected Currency to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, (x) the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans or (y) any Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be ineffective. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan in any Currency is outstanding on the date of the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until such time as a Benchmark Replacement for such Currency is implemented pursuant to this Section 2.13, (i) if such Term Benchmark Loan is denominated in Dollars, then on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, such Loan shall be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars on such day or (ii) if such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan is denominated in any Currency other than Dollars, then such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, at the Borrower s election prior to such day be prepaid by the Borrower on such day.

(b) Capital and Liquidity Requirements. If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity requirements), by an amount deemed to be material by such Lender or such Issuing Bank, then, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s, as applicable, holding company for any such reduction suffered (provided that, such amounts shall be consistent with amounts that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, is generally charging other borrowers similarly situated). (c) Certificates from Lenders. A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the calculation of the amount or amounts, in Dollars, necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be promptly delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof. (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor (including as a result of the occurrence of any Commitment Increase Date or an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period 89 770580030 therefor, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Syndicated Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (including, in connection with any Commitment Increase Date, and regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.10(e) and is revoked in accordance herewith), or (d) the assignment as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18(b) of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each affected Lender for such Lender s loss (other than loss of profit or spread), cost and reasonable expense attributable to such event. Payment under this Section shall be made upon written request of a Lender delivered not later than ten (10) Business Days following the payment, conversion, or failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay that gives rise to a claim under this Section accompanied by a certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the calculation of the amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof. SECTION 2.16. Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Obligor hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law; provided that if any Obligor shall be required to deduct any Taxes from such payments, then (i) if such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or applicable Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Obligor shall make such deductions and (iii) such Obligor shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

90 770580030 (d) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(f) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d). (e) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (f) Tax Documentation. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.16(f)(ii) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (A) any Lender that is a United States person (as defined under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (and such additional copies as shall be reasonably requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender become a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), duly completed and executed copies 91 770580030 of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or any successor form certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; and (B) each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so, whichever of the following is applicable: (w) duly completed and executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E or any successor form claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, (x) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W- 8ECI or any successor form certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, (y) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (1) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (1) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (3) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (2) duly completed and executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E (or any successor form) certifying that the Foreign Lender is not a United States Person, or (z) any other form including Internal Revenue Service Form W- 8IMY as applicable prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. (iii) In addition, each Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence, expiration or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Lender; provided it is legally able to do so at the time. Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at any time the chief tax officer of such Lender becomes aware that it no longer satisfies the legal requirements to provide any previously delivered form or certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. or other taxing authorities for such purpose). (g) Documentation Required by FATCA. If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including 92 770580030 those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such document prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their respective obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.16(g), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. (h) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund or credit (in lieu of such refund) of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause (h), in no event will the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank be required to pay any amount to Borrower pursuant to this clause (h), the payment of which would place such Person in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Person would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns or its books or records (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. (i) Each party s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments, the expiration or cancellation of all Letters of Credit and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment: Sharing of Set-offs. (a) Payments by the Borrower. The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 2:00 p.m., New York time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest 93 770580030 thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent s Account, except as otherwise expressly provided in the relevant Loan Document and except payments to be made directly to any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All amounts owing under this Agreement (including commitment fees, payments required under Section 2.14, and payments required under Section 2.15 relating to any Loan denominated in Dollars, but not including principal of and interest on any Loan denominated in any Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under Section 2.15, or any reimbursement or Cash Collateralization of any LC Exposure denominated in any Foreign Currency, which are payable in such Foreign Currency) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) are payable in Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan or LC Disbursement when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise), the unpaid portion of such Loan or LC Disbursement shall, if such Loan or LC Disbursement is not denominated in Dollars, automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date thereof (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such principal shall be payable on demand; and if the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan or LC Disbursement that is not denominated in Dollars, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date therefor (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such interest shall be payable on demand. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Borrowing in any Foreign Currency, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Borrowing was made (the Original Currency no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower takes all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations. (b) Application of Insufficient Payments. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees of a Class of Commitments then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees of such Class then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in 

94 770580030 accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due to such parties. (c) Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) (x) other than with respect any Syndicated Borrowing requested pursuant to Section 2.21(a)(i), each Syndicated Borrowing of a Class shall be made from the Lenders of such Class of Commitments, (y) other than the payment of a commitment fee to a Non-Extending Lender on the earlier of the date its Commitments terminate and its applicable Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date, each payment of commitment fee under Section 2.11 shall be made for account of the Lenders of the applicable Class, and (z) other than with respect to any termination or reduction of Commitments or prepayment of Loans in accordance with Section 2.08(f), each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments of a Class under Section 2.08 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders of such Class, in each case pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class; (ii) other than with respect to any Syndicated Borrowing requested pursuant to Section 2.21(a)(i), each Syndicated Borrowing of a Class shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders of such Class according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class (in the case of the making of Syndicated Loans) or their respective Loans of such Class that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) other than in connection with a termination or reduction of Commitments or prepayment of Loans in accordance with Section 2.08(f), the payment of a Non-Extending Lender s Non-Extended Loans on such Non-Extending Lender s Non-Extended Final Maturity Date pursuant to Section 2.09(a) or a mandatory prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10(d), each payment or prepayment of principal of Syndicated Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Syndicated Loans of such Class held by them; and (iv) other than the payment of interest to a Non-Extending Lender on the earlier of the date its Commitments terminate and its applicable Non-Extended Final Maturity Date, each payment of interest on Syndicated Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans of such Class then due and payable to the respective Lenders. Each Syndicated Borrowing requested pursuant to Section 2.21(a)(i) shall be made from each Extending Lender and Non-Extending Lender for which the Non-Extending Commitment Termination Date shall not have occurred on a pro rata basis according to the amounts of their respective Commitments. Any termination or reduction of Commitments or prepayment of Loans made in accordance with Section 2.08(f) (including any payment or prepayment of principal of Syndicated Loans in connection therewith), shall be applied to the applicable Non-Extending Lender(s) on a pro rata basis according to the amounts of their respective Commitments or Loans, as applicable, any payment of Non-Extended Loans on a Non-Extended Final Maturity Date pursuant to Section 2.09(a) shall be made for the account of each Non-Extending Lender for which the applicable Non-Extended Final Maturity Date shall have occurred pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Non-Extended Loans held by them and any mandatory prepayment of Non-Extended Loans pursuant to Section 2.10(d) shall be made for account of each Non-Extending Lender for which the applicable Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date shall have occurred pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Non-Extended Loans held by them. For the avoidance of doubt, no payments shall be allocated solely to Non-Extending Lenders following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and the Borrowing Base exceeds the Covered Debt Amount at such time. 95 770580030 (d) Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender of any Class of Commitment shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Syndicated Loans, or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, of such Class resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Syndicated Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, and accrued interest thereon of such Class then due than the proportion received by any other Lender of such Class, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Syndicated Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, of other Lenders of such Class to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Syndicated Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, of such Class; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. (e) Presumptions of Payment. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. (f) Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent. If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.04(d), 2.05(e), 2.06(a) or (b) or 2.17(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. 96 770580030 SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then, at the request of the Borrower, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any cost or expense not required to be reimbursed by the Borrower and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, and, in each case, such Lender has not designated a different lending office in accordance with clause (a) above, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or is a Non-Consenting Lender (as provided in Section 9.02(d)), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Commitment is being assigned, each Issuing Bank and each Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. SECTION 2.19. Defaulting Lenders. (a) Defaulting Lender Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VII or otherwise) or received by Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.08 shall 97 770580030 be applied at such time or times as may be determined by Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize each Issuing Bank s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in the manner described in Section 2.05(d); fourth, as Borrower may request (so long as no Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by Administrative Agent and Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize each Issuing Bank s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in the manner described in Section 2.05(d); sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, Issuing Banks or Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or reimbursement obligations in respect of any LC Disbursement for which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied and waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and reimbursement obligations in respect of any LC Disbursement that is owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or reimbursement obligations in respect of any LC Disbursement that is owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the applicable Commitments without giving effect to Section 2.19(a)(iii). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.19(a)(i) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. (ii) Certain Fees. (A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee pursuant to Sections 2.11(a) and (b) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender); provided that such Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive fees pursuant to Section 2.11(b) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to extent allocable to its Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Percentage, as 

98 770580030 the case may be, of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.19(d). (B) With respect to any Section 2.11(b) fees not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) above, Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender s participation in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iii) below, (y) pay to each Issuing Bank the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Bank s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. (iii) Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated (effective no later than one (1) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has actual knowledge that such Lender has become a Defaulting Lender) among the Non- Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Dollar Percentages and Applicable Multicurrency Percentages, as the case may be (in each case calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitment), but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless Borrower shall have otherwise notified Administrative Agent at such time, Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. (iv) Cash Collateral; Repayment of Swingline Loans. If the reallocation described in clause (iii) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall not later than two (2) Business Days after demand by the Administrative Agent (at the direction of any Issuing Bank and/or any Swingline Lender), without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lender s Swingline Exposure (which exposure shall be deemed equal to the applicable Defaulting Lender s Applicable Percentage of the total outstanding Swingline Exposure (other than Swingline Exposure as to which such Defaulting Lender s participation obligation has been reallocated to other Lenders or Cash Collateralized in accordance with the terms hereof)) and (y) second, Cash Collateralize each Issuing Bank s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.19(d) or (z) make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lenders in their sole discretion to protect them against the risk of non-payment by such Defaulting Lender. (v) Amendments Etc. No Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder or any other Loan Documents 99 770580030 and the Credit Exposure and unused Commitments of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether two-thirds (2/3rds) of the Lenders, two-thirds (2/3rds) of the Lenders of a Class, the Required Lenders or the Required Lenders of a Class have taken or may take any action hereunder or any other Loan Documents, except that the Commitments of such Lender may not be increased or extended, and, except as otherwise set forth herein, amounts payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder may not be permanently reduced, without the consent of such Defaulting Lender (other than reductions in fees and interest in which such reduction does not disproportionately affect such Defaulting Lender). (b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lenders and the Issuing Banks agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that such former Defaulting Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the applicable Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.19(a)(iii)), and if Cash Collateral has been posted with respect to such Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will promptly return or release such Cash Collateral to the Borrower, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender. (c) New Swingline Loans/Letters of Credit. So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) no Swingline Lender shall be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it is satisfied that the participations therein will be fully allocated among Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (a)(iii) above and the Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein and (ii) no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that the participations in any existing Letters of Credit as well as the new, extended, renewed or increased Letter of Credit has been or will be fully allocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (a)(iii) above and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein except to the extent such Defaulting Lender s participation has been or will be fully Cash Collateralized in accordance with Section 2.19(d). (d) Cash Collateral.

(b) Ownership of Subsidiaries. The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, take such action from time to time as shall be necessary to ensure that each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is a wholly owned Subsidiary; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any transaction permitted under Section 6.03 or 6.04, so long as after giving effect to such permitted transaction, each of the remaining Subsidiaries (other than any Immaterial Subsidiaries or Financing Subsidiaries) is a wholly-owned Subsidiary.

118 770580030 agreements and other instruments) as shall be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent: (i) to create, in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties (and any affiliate thereof that is a party to any Hedging Agreement entered into with the Borrower) and the holders of any Secured Longer-Term Indebtedness or Secured Shorter-Term Indebtedness, perfected security interests and Liens in the Collateral; provided that any such security interest or Lien shall be subject to the relevant requirements of the Security Documents, (ii) in the case of any portfolio investment held by a Financing Subsidiary or Immaterial Subsidiary, including any cash collection related thereto, ensure that such portfolio investment shall not be held in the account of any Obligor subject to a control agreement among such Obligor, the Collateral Agent and the Custodian delivered in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, in the case of a participation interest held by any Financing Subsidiary or Immaterial Subsidiary (other than a 100 participation interest held for more than ninety (90) days that was acquired from an Obligor, such Portfolio Investment, including any cash collection related thereto, may be held in any account of any Obligor), so long as, in the case of cash, it is promptly distributed to such Financing Subsidiary or Immaterial Subsidiary, (iii) in the case of any Portfolio Investment consisting of a Bank Loan (as defined in Section 5.13) that does not constitute all of the credit extended to the underlying borrower under the relevant underlying loan documents and a Financing Subsidiary or Immaterial Subsidiary holds any interest in the loans or other extensions of credit under such loan documents, (x) to cause such Financing Subsidiary or Immaterial Subsidiary to be party to such underlying loan documents as a lender having a direct interest (or a participation not acquired from an Obligor) in such underlying loan documents and the extensions of credit thereunder and (y) to ensure that all amounts owing to such Obligor by the underlying borrower or other obligated party are remitted by such borrower or obligated party (or the applicable administrative agents, collateral agents or equivalent Person) directly to the separate accounts of such Obligor and no other amounts owing by such underlying borrower or obligated party are remitted to the accounts of such Obligor, (iv) in the event that any Obligor is acting as an agent or administrative agent under any loan documents with respect to any Bank Loan that does not constitute all of the credit extended to the underlying borrower under the relevant underlying loan documents, to ensure that all funds held by such Obligor in such capacity as agent or administrative agent is segregated from all other funds of such Obligor and clearly identified as being held in an agency capacity and (v) to cause the closing sets and all executed amendments, consents, forbearances and other modifications and assignment agreements relating to any Portfolio Investment and any other documents relating to any Portfolio Investment requested by the Collateral Agent, in each case, to be held by the Collateral Agent or a custodian pursuant to the terms of a custodian agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.

In addition, the Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent on a quarterly basis any valuation reports or presentations delivered to its Board of Directors or received from any Approved Third-Party Appraisers pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii). SECTION 5.12. Portfolio Valuation and Diversification Etc. (a) Industry Classification Groups. For purposes of this Agreement, the Borrower shall assign each Portfolio Investment to an Industry Classification Group. To the extent that any Portfolio Investment is not correlated with the risks of other Portfolio Investments in an Industry Classification Group, such Portfolio Investment may be assigned by the Borrower to an Industry Classification Group that is more closely correlated to such Portfolio Investment. In the absence of any correlation, the Borrower shall be permitted, upon prior notice to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, to create up to three additional industry classification groups for purposes of this Agreement. (b) Portfolio Valuation Etc. (i) Settlement Date Basis. For purposes of this Agreement, all determinations of whether an investment is to be included as a Portfolio Investment shall be determined on a settlement-date basis (meaning that any investment that has been purchased will not be treated as a Portfolio Investment until such purchase has settled, and any Portfolio Investment which has been sold will not be excluded as a Portfolio Investment until such sale has settled); provided that no such investment shall be included as a Portfolio Investment to the extent it has not been paid for in full. (ii) Determination of Values. The Borrower will conduct reviews of the value to be assigned to each of its Portfolio Investments as follows: 120 770580030 (A) Quoted Investments - External Review. With respect to Portfolio Investments (including Cash Equivalents) for which market quotations are readily available, the Borrower shall, not less frequently than once each calendar week, determine the market value of such Portfolio Investments which shall, in each case, be determined in accordance with one of the following methodologies (as selected by the Borrower): (w) in the case of public and 144A securities, the average of the bid prices as determined by two Approved Dealers selected by the Borrower, (x) in the case of Bank Loans, the bid price as determined by one Approved Dealer selected by the Borrower, (y) in the case of any Quoted Investment traded on an exchange, the closing price for such Quoted Investment most recently posted on such exchange, and (z) in the case of any other Quoted Investment, the fair market value thereof as determined by an Approved Pricing Service. (B) Unquoted Investments- External Review. With respect to each Portfolio Investment for which market quotations are not readily available, the Borrower shall, in accordance with its Valuation Policy, determine the fair market value of such Portfolio Investment. (C) Internal Review. The Borrower shall conduct internal reviews of all Portfolio Investments at least once each calendar week which shall take into account any events of which the Borrower has knowledge that materially and adversely affect the aggregate value of the Portfolio Investments. If the value of any Portfolio Investment as most recently determined by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) is lower than the value of such Portfolio Investment as most recently determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(A) and (B), such lower value shall be deemed to be the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes hereof; provided that the Value of any Portfolio Investment of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall be increased by the net unrealized gain as at the date such Value is determined of any Hedging Agreement entered into to hedge risks associated with such Portfolio Investment and reduced by the net unrealized loss as at such date of any such Hedging Agreement (such net unrealized gain or net unrealized loss, on any date, to be equal to the aggregate amount receivable or payable under the related Hedging Agreement if the same were terminated on such date). (D) Failure to Determine Values. If the Borrower shall fail to (x) determine the value of any Portfolio Investment as at any date pursuant to the requirements of the foregoing sub-clause (A), (B) or (C), then the Value of such Portfolio Investment as at such date shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of the 121 770580030 Borrowing Base until such time as the value of such Portfolio Investment is otherwise determined or reviewed, as applicable, in accordance herewith. (E) Testing of Values. (x) For the second calendar month immediately following the end of each fiscal quarter (the last day of such calendar month, the Valuation Testing Date , and the last such fiscal quarter, the Testing Period ), the Administrative Agent shall cause an Approved Third-Party Appraiser selected by the Administrative Agent to value such number of Unquoted Investments (selected by the Administrative Agent) that collectively have an aggregate Value approximately equal to the Calculation Amount; provided, that, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such Unquoted Investments selected by the Administrative Agent shall be Investments that are included in the Borrowing Base. The Administrative Agent agrees to notify the Borrower in writing of the Unquoted Investments selected by the Administrative Agent to be tested in each Testing Period, not later than 15 days prior to the Valuation Testing Date (or such later date as agreed to between the Administrative Agent and the Borrower). If there is a difference between the Borrower s valuation and the Approved Third-Party Appraiser s valuation of any Unquoted Investment, the Value of such Unquoted Investment for Borrowing Base purposes shall be established as set forth in sub-clause (F) below. (y) For the avoidance of doubt, the valuation of any Approved Third-Party Appraiser selected by the Administrative Agent will be as of the Valuation Testing Date and shall be reflected in the Borrowing Base Certificate for the monthly accounting period ending on the Valuation Testing Date if such Approved Third-Party Appraiser delivers such valuation at least seven Business Days before the 20th day after the end of the applicable monthly accounting period and, if such valuation is delivered after such time, it shall, subject to sub-clause (F) below, be included in the Borrowing Base Certificate for the following monthly period and applied to the then applicable balance of the related Portfolio Investment. For illustrative purposes, if the given fiscal quarter is the fourth quarter ending on December 31, 2023, then (A) the Administrative Agent would initiate the testing of Values (using the December 31, 2023 Values) for purposes of determining the scope of the testing under clause (E)(x) during the month of February with the anticipation of receiving the valuations from the applicable Approved Third-Party Appraiser(s) on or after February 29, 2024 and (B)(xx) if such valuations were received before the seventh Business Day before March 20, 2024, such valuations would be included in the March 20, 2024 Borrowing Base Certificate covering the month of February, or (yy) if such valuations were received after such time, they would, subject to clause (F) below, be included in the April 20, 2024 Borrowing Base Certificate for the month of March. 

122 770580030 (F) Valuation Dispute Resolution.

Each SPC shall be conclusively presumed to have made arrangements with its Granting Lender for the exercise of voting and other rights hereunder in a manner which is acceptable to the SPC, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower, and each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Obligors shall be entitled to rely upon and deal solely with the Granting Lender with respect to Loans made by or through its SPC. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by the Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, in respect of claims arising out of this Agreement; provided that the Granting Lender for each SPC hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage and expense arising out of their inability to institute any such proceeding against its SPC.

(f) Participations. Any Lender may, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than any Defaulting Lender, any Disqualified Institution or any natural persons (or a holding company, investments vehicle, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated by or for the primary benefit of a natural Person)) (a Participant in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including 163 770580030 all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to it); provided that, (i) the consent of the Borrower shall not be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or so long as an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing, (ii) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (iii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (g) of this Section 9.04, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16, subject to the requirements and limitations therein, to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04; provided that, such Participant agrees that it (i) shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2.18 as if it were an assignee and (ii) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation; provided, further, that no Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation granted to such Participant and such Participant shall have complied with the requirements of Section 2.16 as if such Participant is a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.18(b) with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that, such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(d) as though it were a Lender hereunder. So long no Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing, all Participants (other than any Participant that is a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender) must execute a Lender NDA, with such changes as requested by such Participant as may be approved by the Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), prior to such Participant s receipt of any confidential information of the Borrower. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register )); provided that, no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any other information relating to a Participant s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any person except to the extent that such disclosures are necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 163 of the Code and any related United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest 164 770580030 error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. (g) Limitations on Rights of Participants. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with paragraphs (e) and (f) of Section 2.16 as though it were a Lender and in the case of a Participant claiming exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, the applicable Lender shall provide the Borrower with satisfactory evidence that the participation is in registered form and shall permit the Borrower to review such register as reasonably needed for the Borrower to comply with its obligations under applicable laws and regulations.

Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto; provided, further, that if any confidential information of the Borrower is to be provided to such pledgee or assignee (in each case, other than a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender) and so long no Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing, such pledgee or assignee must first execute a Lender NDA, with such changes as requested by such pledgee or assignee as may be reasonably approved by the Borrower, prior to its receipt of any such confidential information. (i) Further Limitations on Assignments. Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate any interest in any Loan or LC Exposure held by it hereunder (i) to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries without the prior consent of each Lender, or (ii) to any business development company under the Investment Company Act or any subsidiary thereof or to any private equity fund or person whose primary business is the management of private equity funds (including mezzanine investment funds) excluding any commercial or investment bank (including any commercial or investment bank that sponsors private equity funds or makes private equity investments or mezzanine or other loans), provided that any mezzanine investment fund sponsored by a commercial bank shall not be a permitted assignee or participant under this Section 9.04.

NMFC has provided or may provide to Recipient and Recipient s Representatives (as defined below) for their review in conjunction with evaluating, preparing for or maintaining a potential or ongoing business relationship with NMFC (the Relationship ), certain highly confidential, non-public and proprietary information regarding NMFC and its existing or potential businesses, which information may include, without limitation, financial statements, projections, budgets, current or prospective business plans; investment or trading strategies (including past performance of such strategies and any examples of such strategies), methods and models; investment documents; risk management systems; institutional or organizational structures; financial records and performance data; internal processes and procedures; operational data; compliance materials and reports; personnel information or other non-public data relating to employees, officers, principals, owners, investors, prime brokers or counterparties; trade secrets; prospective projects; information relating to any actual or prospective legal matters (including litigation, regulatory, industry self-regulatory or compliance matters) that may be subject to privilege; information regarding companies in which NMFC has invested or disclosed by those companies to Recipient at NMFC s direction; and any other non-public information relating to NMFC that is or has been revealed to Recipient by or on behalf of NMFC at any time in preparation for or evaluation of the Relationship Confidential Information ). If the Recipient is a governmental entity, or advising a governmental entity, the Confidential Information is being provided voluntarily and contains trade secret and confidential business or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and its state equivalents, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein Recipient hereby agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information pursuant thereto. Confidential Information shall include (i) all disclosures made at any time by or on behalf of NMFC to Recipient, whether made orally, in writing, or by any other means whether tangible, intangible, electronic or observational; (ii) all analyses, compilations, data, studies, notes, memoranda or other documents prepared by Recipient or its Representatives containing or based in whole or in part on Confidential Information, even if such documents do not identify NMFC by name; and (iii) the fact that Recipient has received information hereunder or is considering the possibility of entering, or has entered into, the Relationship. All Confidential Information, except that described in clause (ii) above, is and shall remain the property of NMFC. By disclosing Confidential Information to Recipient, NMFC does not grant to Recipient any license, interest or rights of any kind in or to the Confidential Information. Recipient agrees that the disclosure of Confidential Information to Recipient does not confer upon Recipient any rights in or to the Confidential Information. No representation or warranty is made herein concerning the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information 770580030 or the suitability of the Confidential Information for Recipient s purposes. Representatives shall mean Recipient s officers, directors, employees, accountants and attorneys.

Recipient agrees that absent NMFC s prior written approval it will not name or show NMFC as a client, business partner, or otherwise, in any advertising or marketing materials or other text, audio, visual or electronic media for public distribution.

If Recipient is required by applicable law or regulation to retain any Confidential Information beyond the date upon which it would otherwise be required hereunder to return or destroy such Confidential Information, then notwithstanding the paragraph below, the terms of this Agreement shall continue to apply to all such Confidential Information for as long as it is retained by Recipient. This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier of (i) two years from the date hereof and (ii) the date on which the Recipient or one of its affiliates executes definitive financing documentation in connection with the Relationship containing a confidentiality undertaking by the Recipient or such affiliate, except as otherwise provided herein. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted under the internal laws of the State of New York (without reference to choice of law doctrine). This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which, when taken together, shall be deemed the same agreement. Each individual signing this Agreement on behalf of each respective party represents that he or she has the authority to bind such party hereby. This Agreement may not be changed or modified except by written agreement signed by the parties hereto or their successors in interest. The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable in the event that any of the provisions hereof are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without prior written agreement of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Please sign and return a copy of this Agreement to evidence your acceptance of and agreement to the foregoing terms.
