 Equity investments at fair value classified as Level 2 included common stocks, Cohen Steers Income Opportunities REIT, Inc. (CNSREIT) and preferred securities, for which quoted prices in active markets are not available. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company deconsolidated CNSREIT and elected the fair value option to align the measurement of the seed investment and the related gains and losses with other seed investments. The Company's ownership interest was at September 30, 2024. The fair value of this seed investment is based on the monthly published net asset value (NAV), which is an observable transaction price, however, shares are not actively traded as subscription and redemption activity happens monthly. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in gain (loss) from investments net in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. Distributions from this seed investment are recorded in interest and dividend income in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations when earned. The unrealized gain on the seed investment in CNSREIT was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Equity investments at fair value classified as Level 3 were comprised of limited partnership interests in joint ventures that hold investments in private real estate. 
 Trading investments classified as Level 2 were comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Fair values were generally determined using third-party pricing services. The pricing services may utilize evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. 
 Investments measured at NAV were comprised of certain investments measured at fair value using NAV (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient including limited partnership interests in private real estate funds. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have the ability to redeem its interests in the majority of these investments. 
 Investments measured at NAV as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The amounts presented in the above tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.

 Valuation Techniques 
 In certain instances, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable broker-dealers or independent pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, independent pricing services may use information with respect to transactions in such investments, broker quotes, pricing matrices, market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. As part of its independent price verification process, the Company generally performs reviews of valuations provided by broker-dealers or independent pricing services. Investments in funds are valued at their closing price or NAV (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. 
 In the absence of observable market prices, the Company values its investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis. For some investments, little market activity may exist; management's determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances, and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involve a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors. Such investments are valued no less than quarterly, taking into consideration any changes in key inputs and changes in economic and other relevant conditions, and valuation models are updated accordingly. The Company has established a valuation committee, comprised of senior members from various departments within the Company, to administer, implement and oversee the valuation policies and procedures (the Valuation Committee). Additionally, the Company has retained an independent valuation services firm to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain private real estate investments.

Executive Overview 
 General 
 We are a global investment manager specializing in real assets and alternative income, including listed and private real estate, preferred securities, infrastructure, resource equities, commodities, as well as multi-strategy solutions. Founded in 1986, we are headquartered in New York City, with offices in London, Dublin, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore. 
 Our primary investment strategies include U.S. real estate, preferred securities, including low duration preferred securities, private real estate solutions, global/international real estate, global listed infrastructure, real assets multi-strategy, and global natural resource equities. Our strategies seek to achieve a variety of investment objectives for different risk profiles and are actively managed by specialist teams of investment professionals who employ fundamental-driven research and portfolio management processes. We offer our strategies through a variety of investment vehicles, including U.S. and non-U.S. registered funds and other commingled vehicles, separate accounts and subadvised portfolios. 
 Our distribution network encompasses two major channels, wealth and institutional. Our wealth channel includes registered investment advisers, wirehouses, independent and regional broker dealers and bank trusts. Our institutional channel includes sovereign wealth funds, corporate plans, insurance companies and public funds, including defined benefit and defined contribution plans, as well as other financial institutions that access our investment management services directly or through consultants and other intermediaries. 
 Our revenue from the wealth channel is primarily derived from investment advisory, administration, distribution and service fees from open-end and closed-end funds as well as other commingled vehicles. Our revenue from the institutional channel is derived from fees received from our clients for managing advised and subadvised accounts. Our fees are based on contractually specified rates applied to the value of the assets we manage and, in certain cases, may include a performance-based fee. Our revenue fluctuates with changes in the total value of our assets under management, which may occur as a result of market appreciation and depreciation, contributions to or withdrawals from investor accounts and distributions. This revenue is recognized over the period that the assets are managed.

Investment Performance at September 30, 2024 
 _________________________ 
 (1) Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Outperformance is determined by comparing the annualized investment performance of each investment strategy to the performance of specified reference benchmarks. Investment performance in excess of the performance of the benchmark is considered outperformance. The investment performance calculation of each investment strategy is based on all active accounts and investment models pursuing similar investment objectives. For accounts, actual investment performance is measured gross of fees and net of withholding taxes. For investment models, for which actual investment performance does not exist, the investment performance of a composite of accounts pursuing comparable investment objectives is used as a proxy for actual investment performance. The performance of the specified reference benchmark for each account and investment model is measured net of withholding taxes, where applicable.

General and administrative expenses decreased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to lower rent expense of 6.2 million related to the expiration of the lease for the Company s prior headquarters in January 2024. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included 1.4 million of reduced projected costs associated with the implementation of the Company's trade order management system to reflect the actual amount paid. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and leasehold improvements associated with the Company's current headquarters that were placed in service in December 2023.

Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to As Adjusted Financial Results 
 Management believes that use of the following as adjusted (non-GAAP) financial results provides greater transparency into the Company s operating performance. In addition, these as adjusted financial results are used to prepare the Company's internal management reports which are used in evaluating its business. 
 While management believes that these as adjusted financial results are useful in evaluating operating performance, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Changes in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We seek to maintain a balance sheet that supports our business strategies and provides the appropriate amount of liquidity at all times. 
 Net Liquid Assets 
 Our current financial condition is highly liquid and is primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury securities, liquid seed investments and other current assets. Liquid assets are reduced by current liabilities (together, net liquid assets). 
 The table below summarizes net liquid assets: (in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 106,474 187,442 U.S. Treasury securities 168,218 59,942 Liquid seed investments net 73,706 71,375 Other current assets 82,481 73,360 Current liabilities (84,883) (106,603) Net liquid assets 345,996 285,516 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents are on deposit with major national financial institutions and include short-term, highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into cash. 
 U.S. Treasury securities 
 U.S. Treasury securities, recorded at fair value, are directly issued by the U.S. government and were classified as trading investments. 
 Liquid seed investments net 
 Liquid seed investments, recorded at fair value, are generally traded in active markets on major exchanges and can typically be liquidated within a normal settlement cycle. Liquid seed investments are primarily securities held directly for the purpose of establishing performance track records and the Company's economic interest in certain consolidated investment vehicles which are presented net of noncontrolling interests. 
 Other current assets 
 Other current assets primarily represent investment advisory and administration fees receivable. At September 30, 2024, receivables from institutional accounts comprised 48.4 of other current assets, while receivables from open-end and closed-end funds, together, comprised 46.3 of other current assets. We perform a review of our receivables on an ongoing basis to assess collectability and, based on our analysis at September 30, 2024, there was no allowance for uncollectible accounts required. 
 Current liabilities 
 Current liabilities included accrued compensation and benefits, distribution and service fees payable, operating lease obligations due within 12 months, certain income taxes payable and certain other liabilities and accrued expenses. 
 Future liquidity needs 
 Our business has become more capital intensive. Potential uses of capital range from, among other things, seeding new strategies and investment vehicles, co-investing in private real estate vehicles, funding the upfront costs associated with closed-end fund launches and rights offerings, and making various investments to grow our firm infrastructure as our business scales. In order to provide us with the financial flexibility to pursue these opportunities, we have a 100.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on January 20, 2026. To date, we have not drawn on the credit facility. 
 31 

On April 22, 2024, we issued 1,007,057 shares of common stock through an offering. The net proceeds, after deducting commissions and offering expenses, were approximately 68.5 million. We intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including seeding track record strategies and investment vehicles. The offering was completed on April 22, 2024 after the issuance of the shares. 
 We have committed to invest up to 50.0 million in Cohen Steers Real Estate Opportunities Fund, L.P. (REOF) of which 21.7 million remained unfunded as of September 30, 2024. In addition, we have committed to invest 125.0 million in Cohen Steers Income Opportunities REIT, Inc. (CNSREIT) of which 92.8 million remained unfunded as of September 30, 2024. There are contractual restrictions on redemption of our seed investments in REOF and CNSREIT. 
 Cash flows 
 Our cash flows generally result from the operating activities of our business, with investment advisory and administration fees being the most significant contributor. 
 The table below summarizes our cash flows: Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 61,862 113,384 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (142,822) (128,033) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 5,061 (99,160) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (75,899) (113,809) Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1,988 724 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of the period 189,603 248,714 Cash and cash equivalents, end of the period 115,692 135,629 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 75.9 million, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate changes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash flows from operating activities primarily consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 61.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in investing activities was 142.8 million, which included net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities held for corporate purposes of 106.8 million and the funding of 32.0 million of our 125.0 million commitment to CNSREIT. Net cash provided by financing activities was 5.1 million, including proceeds from issuance of common stock from offering of 68.5 million and net contributions from noncontrolling interests of 44.5 million, partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders of 89.2 million and repurchases of common stock to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations on the vesting and delivery of restricted stock units of 19.6 million. 
 Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The Company s material contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies at September 30, 2024 include operating leases, investment commitments, and purchase obligations. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 other than the items described below. 
 Investment Commitments 
 We have committed to invest up to 50.0 million in REOF. As of September 30, 2024, we had funded 28.3 million of this commitment. In addition, we have committed to invest 125.0 million in CNSREIT. As of September 30, 2024, we had funded 32.2 million of this commitment. 
 Dividends 
 Subject to the approval of our board of directors, we anticipate paying dividends. When determining whether to pay a dividend, we take into account general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans, our results of operations and 
 32 

financial condition, cash flow and liquidity, contractual, legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends, if any, by us and our subsidiaries and such other factors deemed relevant. 
 On November 7, 2024, we declared a quarterly dividend on our common s tock in the amount of 0.59 per share. This dividend will be payable on December 2, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 18, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 A complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no changes to the Company s accounting estimates for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 33 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to risk as a result of changes in interest and currency rates, 
 securities markets and other general economic conditions, including inflation, which may have an adverse impact on the value of our assets under management and our seed investments. The majority of our revenue is derived from investment advisory and administration fees, which are based on average assets under management. Accordingly, where there are changes in the value of the assets we manage as a result of market fluctuations our revenue may change. 
 The economic environment may also preclude us from increasing the assets we manage in closed-end funds. The 
 market conditions for these offerings may not be favorable in the future, which could adversely impact our ability to grow 
 the assets we manage. Depending on market conditions, the closed-end funds we manage may increase or decrease their leverage in order to maintain target leverage ratios, thereby increasing or decreasing the assets we manage and the associated revenue. 
 Seed Investments 
 Our seed investments include both liquid and illiquid holdings. Liquid seed investments are generally traded in active markets on major exchanges and can typically be liquidated within a normal settlement cycle. Illiquid seed investments are generally comprised of limited partnership interests in private real estate vehicles and our seed investment in CNSREIT for which there may be contractual restrictions on redemption. 
 Our seed investments are subject to market risk. We may mitigate this risk by entering into derivative contracts designed to hedge certain portions of our risk. The following table summarizes the effect of a ten percent increase or decrease on the carrying value of our seed investments, which are presented net of noncontrolling interests, if any, as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 Carrying

 Notional Value - Hedges Net Carrying Value

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
