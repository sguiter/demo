FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that relate to our plans, objectives, estimates, and goals. Statements expressing expectations regarding our future, or projections or estimates relating to products, sales, revenues, expenditures, costs, strategies, initiatives, or earnings, are typical of such statements and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on management s beliefs, assumptions, and expectations about our future performance, considering the information currently available to management. The words believe, may, could, will, should, would, anticipate, plan, estimate, project, expect, intend, seek, strive, and words of similar import, or the negative of such words, identify or signal the presence of forward-looking statements. These statements are not statements of historical fact; they involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or financial condition to differ materially from the expectations of future results, performance, or financial condition that we express or imply in any forward-looking statement. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: 
 the competitive nature of the textile industry and the impact of global competition; 

changes in the trade regulatory environment and governmental policies and legislation; 

the availability, sourcing, and pricing of raw materials; 

general domestic and international economic and industry conditions in markets where the Company competes, including economic and political factors over which the Company has no control; 

changes in consumer spending, customer preferences, fashion trends, and end-uses for the Company s products; 

the financial condition of the Company s customers; 

the loss of a significant customer or brand partner; 

natural disasters, industrial accidents, power or water shortages, extreme weather conditions, and other disruptions at one of the Company s facilities; 

the disruption of operations, global demand, or financial performance as a result of catastrophic or extraordinary events, including, but not limited to, epidemics or pandemics; 

the success of the Company s strategic business initiatives; 

the volatility of financial and credit markets, including the impacts of counterparty risk (e.g., deposit concentration and recent depositor sentiment and activity); 

the ability to service indebtedness and fund capital expenditures and strategic business initiatives; 

the availability of and access to credit on reasonable terms; 

changes in foreign currency exchange, interest, and inflation rates; 

fluctuations in production costs; 

the ability to protect intellectual property; 

the strength and reputation of the Company s brands; 

employee relations; 

the ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees; 

the impact of climate change or environmental, health, and safety regulations; 

the impact of tax laws, the judicial or administrative interpretations of tax laws, and/or changes in such laws or interpretations; and 

other factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 or in the Company s other periodic reports and information filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 

All such factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results, and may be beyond our control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors or to assess the impact of each such factor on the Company. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made, except as may be required by federal securities laws. 
 In light of all of the above considerations, we reiterate that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we caution you not to rely on them as such.

Third-party manufacturer revenue is primarily generated through sales to direct customers. Such sales represent satisfaction of UNIFI s performance obligations required by the associated revenue contracts. Each of UNIFI s reportable segments derives revenue from sales to third-party manufacturers. Service Revenue Service revenue is primarily generated, as services are rendered, through fulfillment of toll manufacturing of textile products or transportation services governed by written agreements. Such toll manufacturing and transportation services represent satisfaction of UNIFI s performance obligations required by the associated revenue contracts. REPREVE Fiber REPREVE Fiber represents UNIFI's collection of fiber products on our recycled platform, with or without added technologies. Variable Consideration For all variable consideration, where appropriate, UNIFI estimates the amount using the expected value method, which takes into consideration historical experience, current contractual requirements, specific known market events, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect UNIFI s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which the customer is entitled based on the terms of the contracts. Variable consideration has been immaterial to UNIFI s financial statements for all periods presented. 

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined within this Note shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 28, 2022 (the "2022 Credit Agreement") as amended.

ABL Facility and Amendments On September 5, 2024, UNIFI, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a First Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the First Amendment with a syndicate of lenders. The First Amendment primarily (i) permits the sale of a Company-owned real estate asset (consisting of an industrial warehouse building and land acreage) located in Yadkinville, North Carolina with application of the net proceeds to reduce the outstanding ABL Revolver balance, in lieu of the prescribed mandatory prepayment to the ABL Term Loan; (ii) reduces the Maximum Revolver Amount from to ; (iii) modifies the definition of the Trigger Level as of any date of determination to the greater of (a) and (b) of the sum of (i) the Maximum Revolver Amount plus (ii) the outstanding principal amount of the ABL Term Loan on such date of determination; (iv) increases the range of the

 to and (b) Base Rate-based loans to a new range of to , with such new ranges of Applicable Margin rates becoming immediately effective and continuing until the Company achieves a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of to or better; (v) for a Term Loan Reset, establishes an additional requirement to obtain lender approval; and (vi) modifies certain terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement including, but not limited to, Swing Loans, Letter of Credit sublimits, and costs related to normal course collateral valuations for the ABL Facility. Subsequent Event On October 25, 2024, UNIFI entered into a new credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association for a revolving credit facility (the "2024 Facility"). The maturity date of the 2024 Facility is the earlier of (i) and (ii) the termination or refinancing of the 2022 Credit Agreement. The 2024 Facility is deemed unsecured financing for UNIFI, but is collateralized by certain assets pledged by related party Kenneth G. Langone, one of the members of UNIFI's Board of Directors. Borrowings under the 2024 Facility bear interest at a rate of SOFR plus . The 2024 Facility contains no additional financial covenants beyond those already in effect for the 2022 Credit Agreement and is subject to a monthly unused line fee of on available borrowing capacity. As of the report date, no amounts had been borrowed against the 2024 Facility.

Effective tax rate 

() 

Income Tax Expense UNIFI s provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 was calculated by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax book income and adjusting for discrete items that occurred during the period. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the U.S. generated losses for which UNIFI does not expect to realize a future tax benefit. During the three months ended October 1, 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS audit of fiscal years 2014 through 2019 was concluded with a net refund of . The impact from the audit adjustments to the prior periods was insignificant. Unrecognized Tax Benefits UNIFI regularly assesses the outcomes of both completed and ongoing examinations to ensure that its provision for income taxes is sufficient. Certain returns that remain open to examination have utilized carryforward tax attributes generated in prior tax years, including net operating losses, which could potentially be revised upon examination. Following the conclusion of the IRS audit during the period ended October 1, 2023, UNIFI adjusted the uncertain tax positions for fiscal years 2014 through 2019 that were effectively settled. The impact from releasing the netted uncertain tax position liabilities was insignificant.

, UNIFI s shareholders approved a First Amendment (the "First Amendment") to the Unifi, Inc. Second Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2020 Plan ). The 2020 Plan set the initial number of shares available for future issuance share reserve pursuant to awards granted under the 2020 Plan to . The First Amendment increased the remaining share reserve by . No additional awards can be granted under prior plans; however, awards outstanding under a respective prior plan remain subject to that plan s provisions.

 reportable segments are organized as follows: The operations within the Americas Segment exhibit similar long-term economic characteristics and primarily sell into an economic trading zone covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement to similar customers utilizing similar methods of distribution. These operations derive revenues primarily from manufacturing synthetic and recycled textile products with sales primarily to yarn manufacturers, knitters, and weavers that produce yarn and/or fabric for the apparel, hosiery, automotive, home furnishings, industrial, medical, and other end-use markets principally in North and Central America. The Americas Segment consists of sales and manufacturing operations in the U.S., El Salvador, and Colombia. 

 The Brazil Segment primarily manufactures and sells polyester-based products to knitters and weavers that produce fabric for the apparel, automotive, home furnishings, industrial, and other end-use markets principally in Brazil. The Brazil Segment includes a manufacturing location and sales offices in Brazil. 

 The operations within the Asia Segment exhibit similar long-term economic characteristics and sell to similar customers utilizing similar methods of distribution primarily in Asia and Europe. The Asia Segment primarily sources synthetic and recycled textile products from third-party suppliers and sells to yarn manufacturers, knitters, and weavers that produce fabric for the apparel, automotive, home furnishings, industrial, and other end-use markets principally in Asia and Europe. The Asia Segment includes sales offices in China, Turkey, and Hong Kong. 

 UNIFI evaluates the operating performance of its segments based upon Segment (Loss) Profit, which represents segment gross (loss) profit plus segment depreciation expense. This measurement of segment profit or loss best aligns segment reporting with the current assessments and evaluations performed by, and information provided to, the CODM. The accounting policies for the segments are consistent with UNIFI s accounting policies. Intersegment sales are omitted from segment disclosures, as they are (i) insignificant to UNIFI s segments and eliminated from consolidated reporting and (ii) excluded from segment evaluations performed by the CODM.

UNIFI made a payment to the former joint venture partner of in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and the remaining was paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Accordingly, the balance sheet information presented below as of September 29, 2024 does not include any amounts related to UNF. UNF America LLC Raw material and production services for UNFA are provided by Nilit America Inc. under separate supply and services agreements. UNFA s fiscal year end is December 31, and it is a limited liability company located in Ridgeway, Virginia. UNFA is treated as a partnership for its income tax reporting. In conjunction with the formation of UNFA, UNIFI entered into a supply agreement with UNF and UNFA whereby UNIFI agreed to purchase all of its first quality nylon POY requirements for texturing (subject to certain exceptions) from either UNF or UNFA. The supply agreement has no stated minimum purchase quantities and pricing is typically negotiated every six months, based on market rates. As of September 29, 2024, UNIFI s open purchase orders related to this supply agreement, all with UNFA, w ere . 

UNF 

Total 

As of September 29, 2024 and June 30, 2024, UNIFI had accounts payable due to UNF A of and . UNIFI has determined that UNF was, and UNFA is, a variable interest entity and has also determined that UNIFI has been the primary beneficiary of these entities, based on the terms of the supply agreement. As a result, these entities should be consolidated with UNIFI s financial results. As (i) UNIFI purchases substantially all of the output and all intercompany sales would be eliminated in consolidation, (ii) the entity balance sheets constitute or less of UNIFI s current assets and total assets, and (iii) such balances are not expected to comprise a larger portion in the future, UNIFI has not included the accounts of UNF and UNFA in its consolidated financial statements and instead is accounting for these entities as equity investments. The financial results of UNF and UNFA are included in UNIFI s consolidated financial statements with a one-month lag, using the equity method of accounting and with intercompany profits eliminated in accordance with UNIFI s accounting policy. Other than the supply agreement discussed above, UNIFI does not provide any other commitments or guarantees related to UNFA.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected UNIFI s operations, along with material changes in financial condition, during the periods included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. A reference to a note in this section refers to the accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. A reference to the current period refers to the three-month period ended September 29, 2024, while a reference to the prior period refers to the three-month period ended October 1, 2023. Such references may be accompanied by certain phrases for added clarity. The current period and the prior period each consisted of 13 weeks. 
 Our discussions in this Item 2 focus on our results during, or as of, the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, and, to the extent applicable, any material changes from the information discussed in the 2024 Form 10-K or other important intervening developments or information. These discussions should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K for more detailed and background information about our business, operations, and financial condition. 
 Discussion of foreign currency translation is primarily associated with changes in the Brazilian Real BRL and changes in the Chinese Renminbi RMB versus the U.S. Dollar USD ). Weighted average exchange rates were as follows:

 Overview and Significant General Matters 
 UNIFI focuses on delivering products and solutions to direct customers and brand partners throughout the world, leveraging our internal manufacturing capabilities and an enhanced global supply chain that delivers a diverse range of synthetic and recycled fibers and polymers. Our strategic initiatives include (i) leveraging our competitive advantages to grow market share in each of the major geographies we serve, (ii) expanding our presence in non-apparel markets with additional REPREVE products, (iii) advancing the development and commercialization of innovative and sustainable solutions, and (iv) increasing brand awareness for REPREVE . We have increased our focus on sales opportunities beyond traditional apparel customers and continue to drive innovation throughout our portfolio to further diversify the business and enhance gross profit. We believe our strategic initiatives will increase revenue and profitability and generate improved cash flows from operations. 
 Current Economic Environment 
 The challenging environment for textile production and demand has adversely impacted our consolidated sales and profitability. In addition, the following pressures have been present: (i) the impact of inflation on consumer spending and (ii) elevated interest rates for consumers and customers, including the impact on the carrying costs of customer inventories. UNIFI will continue to monitor these and other aspects of the current environment and work closely with stakeholders to ensure business continuity and liquidity. 
 While we recognize the disruption to global markets and supply chains caused by the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, we have not been directly impacted. Indirectly, we recognize that additional or prolonged impacts to the petroleum or other global markets could cause further inflationary pressures to our global raw material costs or additional unforeseen adverse impacts. 
 Input Costs and Global Production Volatility 
 Despite lowered input and freight costs and a marginally more stable labor pool recently, global demand volatility and uncertainty continued into fiscal 2025. The threat of recession and global tensions continue to create uncertainty. Such existing challenges and future uncertainty, particularly for rising input costs, labor productivity, and global demand, could worsen and/or continue for prolonged periods, materially impacting our consolidated sales, gross profit, and operating cash flows. Also, the need for future selling price adjustments in connection with inflationary costs could impact our ability to retain current customer programs and compete successfully for new programs in certain regions. 
 Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 UNIFI continuously reviews performance indicators to measure its success. These performance indicators form the basis of management s discussion and analysis included below: 
 sales volume and revenue for UNIFI and for each reportable segment; 

gross (loss) profit and gross margin for UNIFI and for each reportable segment; 

net loss and diluted EPS; 

Segment (Loss) Profit, which equals segment gross (loss) profit plus segment depreciation expense; 

unit conversion margin, which represents unit net sales price less unit raw material costs, for UNIFI and for each reportable segment; 

working capital, which represents current assets less current liabilities; 

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization EBITDA ), which represents net loss before net interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense; 

13 

Adjusted EBITDA, which represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude, from time to time, certain other adjustments necessary to understand and compare the underlying results of UNIFI; 

Adjusted Net Loss, which represents net loss calculated under GAAP, adjusted to exclude certain amounts which management believes do not reflect the ongoing operations and performance of UNIFI and/or for which exclusion may be necessary to understand and compare the underlying results of UNIFI; 

Adjusted EPS, which represents Adjusted Net Loss divided by UNIFI s diluted weighted average common shares outstanding; 

Adjusted Working Capital, which equals receivables plus inventories and other current assets, less accounts payable and other current liabilities; and 

Net Debt, which represents debt principal less cash and cash equivalents. 

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Working Capital, and Net Debt (collectively, the non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The calculations of the non-GAAP financial measures are subjective, based on management s belief as to which items should be included or excluded in order to provide the most reasonable and comparable view of the underlying operating performance of the business. We may, from time to time, modify the amounts used to determine our non-GAAP financial measures. When applicable, management s discussion and analysis includes specific consideration for items that comprise the reconciliations of its non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures better reflect UNIFI s underlying operations and performance and that their use, as operating performance measures, provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles, and ages of related assets, among otherwise comparable companies. 
 Management uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis, as it removes the impact of items (a) directly related to our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) and/or (b) that we would not expect to occur as a part of our normal business on a regular basis; (ii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget; (iii) as a valuation measure for evaluating our operating performance and our capacity to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business; and (iv) as one measure in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance metric utilized in the determination of variable compensation. We also believe Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity because it serves as a high-level proxy for cash generated from operations and is relevant to our fixed charge coverage ratio. 
 Management uses Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS (i) as measurements of net operating performance because they assist us in comparing such performance on a consistent basis, as they remove the impact of (a) items that we would not expect to occur as a part of our normal business on a regular basis and (b) components of the provision for income taxes that we would not expect to occur as a part of our underlying taxable operations; (ii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget; and (iii) as measures in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions. 
 Management uses Adjusted Working Capital as an indicator of UNIFI s production efficiency and ability to manage inventories and receivables. 
 Management uses Net Debt as a liquidity and leverage metric to determine how much debt would remain if all cash and cash equivalents were used to pay down debt principal.

(2) For the periods presented, there were no other adjustments necessary to reconcile Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA. 

Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP Financial Measures) 
 For the current period and the prior period, there were no adjustments necessary to reconcile Net loss to Adjusted Net Loss or Adjusted EPS. 
 Net Sales 
 Consolidated net sales for the current period increased by 8,528, or 6.1 , while consolidated sales volumes increased 7.7 , compared to the prior period. Net sales in the current period were higher primarily due to improved sales volumes in each of the reportable segments, along with favorable pricing in Brazil. Despite these sales volume improvements, volumes remain depressed, particularly in the Americas and Asia Segments as a result of continued weak global demand. 
 Consolidated weighted average sales prices decreased 1.6 which partially offset the volume increase. The decrease in sales prices was primarily attributable to sales mix and lower average selling prices in Asia and the Americas Segment, together with unfavorable foreign currency translation effects from the weakening of the BRL versus the USD within our Brazil Segment. 
 REPREVE Fiber products for the current period comprised 30 , or 44,742, of consolidated net sales, compared to 31 , or 42,461, for the prior period. 
 15 

Gross Profit (Loss) 
 Gross profit for the current period increased to 9,458 from a gross loss of (575) in the prior period. Gross profit increased primarily due to (i) increased sales volumes, (ii) variable cost saving initiatives, (iii) improved productivity, and (iv) higher conversion margins. However, gross profit continues to be unfavorably impacted by weak fixed cost absorption in the Americas Segment, where utilization and productivity remain below historical averages due to depressed demand. 
 For the Americas Segment, gross profit increased primarily due to (i) higher sales volumes, (ii) higher conversion margins, and (iii) variable cost management efforts. 

For the Brazil Segment, gross profit increased primarily due to (i) improved selling prices, (ii) higher sales volumes from market share gains, and (iii) lower material input costs due to lower costed inventories at the beginning of the quarter. 

For the Asia Segment, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower conversion margins from a weak demand environment. 

SG A 
 SG A did not change meaningfully from the prior period to the current period, nor did the change include any significant offsetting impacts. 
 Provision (Benefit) for Bad Debts 
 The current period and prior period provision reflect no material activity. 
 Other Operating Expense, Net 
 The current period and the prior period include foreign currency transaction losses (gains) of 489 and (33), respectively, with no other meaningful activity. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net increased primarily due to lower interest income in the current period, associated with lower global cash balances. 
 Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates 
 There was no material activity for the current period or the prior period. 
 Income Taxes 
 Provision (benefit) for income taxes and the effective tax rate were as follows:

October 1, 2023 

Provision (benefit) for income taxes 

2,177 

(463) 

Effective tax rate 

(39.9) 

3.4 

The effective tax rate is subject to variation due to a number of factors, including variability in pre-tax book income; the mix of income by jurisdiction; changes in deferred tax valuation allowances; and changes in statutes, audit settlement, regulations, and case law. Additionally, the impacts of discrete and other rate impacting items are more pronounced when loss before income taxes is lower. 
 The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a decrease in the valuation allowance on deferred tax asset balances adjusted by the IRS audit of tax years 2014 through 2019, which was concluded during the prior period. The impact of this on comparative results is heightened by a smaller loss before income taxes in the current period. 
 Net Loss 
 The improvement in net loss was primarily attributable to increased gross profit, partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses, higher interest expense, net, and higher income tax expense. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily attributable to increased gross profit, partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses.

The increase in net sales for the Americas Segment from the prior period to the current period was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes, partially offset by a lower-priced sales mix. Both periods were unfavorably impacted by the continued weak global textile demand environment. 
 The change in Segment Profit (Loss) for the Americas Segment was as follows:

(1,883) 

Change in underlying unit margins and sales mix 

6,069

Segment Profit for the current period 

4,032 

The increase in Segment Profit for the Americas Segment from the prior period to the current period was primarily attributable to higher conversion margins primarily due to improved variable cost management efforts. Segment Profit for the Americas Segment continues to be negatively impacted by a lower proportion of fiber sales volumes. As fiber products carry a higher selling price and allocation of production costs versus Chip and Flake, lower fiber production drives weaker fixed cost absorption and adversely impacts gross profit and gross margin. 
 Brazil Segment 
 The components of Segment Profit, each component as a percentage of net sales, and the percentage increase or decrease over the prior period amounts for the Brazil Segment, were as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Note 5, Long-Term Debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements includes the detail of UNIFI s debt obligations and terms and conditions thereof. Further discussion and analysis of liquidity and capital resources follow. 
 UNIFI s primary capital requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures, and debt service. UNIFI s primary sources of capital are cash generated from operations, borrowings available under the 2022 Credit Agreement, and 2024 Facility. For the current three-month period, cash used by operations was 12,834 and, at September 29, 2024, availability under the ABL Revolver was 38,645. 
 As of September 29, 2024, all of UNIFI s 131,691 of debt obligations were guaranteed by certain of its domestic operating subsidiaries, while nearly all of UNIFI s cash and cash equivalents were held by its foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries may not be presently available to fund UNIFI s domestic capital requirements, including its domestic debt obligations. UNIFI employs a variety of strategies to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations where it is needed. 
 The following table presents a summary of cash and cash equivalents, borrowings available under financing arrangements, liquidity, working capital, and total debt obligations as of September 29, 2024 for domestic operations compared to foreign operations: 

Domestic

101,769 

174,946 

Total debt obligations 

131,691 

131,691 

Borrowings available under financing arrangements are generally collateralized by receivables and inventory owned in the U.S. and generally constrained by the fixed charge coverage ratio and trigger level prescribed in the 2022 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, not all of such funds are immediately available for use in UNIFI's operations. UNIFI s primary cash requirements, in addition to normal course operating activities (e.g., working capital and payroll), primarily include (i) capital expenditures that generally have commitments of up to 12 months, (ii) contractual obligations that support normal course ongoing operations and production, (iii) operating leases and finance leases, (iv) debt service, and (v) share repurchases. 
 Liquidity Considerations 
 Following the establishment of the 2024 Facility, UNIFI believes its global cash and liquidity positions are sufficient to sustain its operations and to meet its growth needs for the foreseeable future. Additionally, UNIFI considers opportunities to repatriate existing cash to reduce debt and preserve or enhance liquidity. However, further degradation in the macroeconomic environment could introduce additional liquidity risk and require UNIFI to limit cash outflows for discretionary activities while further utilizing available and additional forms of credit. 
 We do not currently anticipate that any adverse events or circumstances will place critical pressure on our liquidity position or our ability to fund our operations and expected business growth. Should global demand, economic activity, or input availability decline considerably for an even longer period of time, UNIFI maintains the ability to (i) seek additional credit or financing arrangements and/or (ii) re-implement cost reduction initiatives to preserve cash and secure the longevity of the business and operations. Management continues to (i) explore cost savings opportunities and (ii) prioritize repayment of debt in the current operating environment. 
 When business levels increase, we expect to use cash in support of working capital needs. 
 The following outlines the attributes relating to our credit facility as of September 29, 2024: 
 UNIFI was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants in the 2022 Credit Agreement; 

excess availability before the Trigger Level (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) under the ABL Revolver was 20,755; 

the Trigger Level was 17,890; and 

0 of standby letters of credit were outstanding. 

On October 25, 2024, UNIFI entered into a new credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association for a 25,000 revolving credit facility (the "2024 Facility"). The maturity date of the 2024 Facility is the earlier of (i) October 28, 2027 and (ii) the termination or refinancing of the 2022 Credit Agreement. The 2024 Facility is deemed unsecured financing for UNIFI, but is collateralized by certain assets pledged by related party Kenneth G. Langone, one of the members of UNIFI's Board of Directors. Borrowings under the 2024 Facility bear interest at a rate of SOFR plus 0.90 . The 2024 Facility contains no additional financial covenants beyond those already in effect for the 2022 Credit Agreement and is subject to a monthly unused line fee of 0.25 on available borrowing capacity. As of the report date, no amounts had been borrowed against the 2024 Facility. 

In addition to making payments in accordance with the scheduled maturities of debt required under its existing debt obligations, UNIFI may, from time to time, elect to repay additional amounts borrowed under the ABL Facility and 2024 Facility. Funds to make such repayments may come from the operating cash flows of the business or other sources and will depend upon UNIFI s strategy, prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions within the 2022 Credit Agreement, and other factors. 
 19 

Liquidity Summary 
 UNIFI has met its historical liquidity requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, and other operating needs from its cash flows from operations and available borrowings. UNIFI believes that its existing cash balances, cash provided by operating activities, and credit facility will enable UNIFI to meet its foreseeable liquidity requirements. For its foreign operations, UNIFI expects its existing cash balances, cash provided by operating activities, and available financing arrangements will provide the needed liquidity to fund the associated operating activities and investing activities, such as future capital expenditures. UNIFI believes its operations in Asia and Brazil are in a position to obtain local country financing arrangements due to the operating results of each subsidiary.

Adjusted Working Capital increased 15,305 from June 30, 2024 to September 29, 2024. 
 The increase in Adjusted Working Capital was primarily attributable to an increase in inventories, partially impacted by insignificant changes in other balance sheet accounts. The increase in inventories was primarily a result of weaker-than-expected sales levels in the U.S. and Asia, causing a decrease in inventory turnover.

The decrease in operating cash flows was due to increased working capital primarily from an increase in inventories (as described above), partially offset by an improvement in earnings in the current period compared to the prior period. 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 Investing activities primarily include 2,018 for capital expenditures. UNIFI expects recent and future capital projects to provide benefits to future profitability. The additional assets from these capital projects consist primarily of machinery and equipment. In March 2023, UNIFI amended certain existing contracts related to future purchases of texturing machinery by delaying the scheduled receipt and installation of such equipment in the U.S. and El Salvador for 18 months. In December 2023, UNIFI extended this delay by an additional 12 months at no cost to the Company. 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 Financing activities primarily include net proceeds from the ABL Revolver and payments on the ABL Term Loan. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 As described in Note 7, Shareholders Equity, no share repurchases have been completed in fiscal 2025. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 UNIFI incurs various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Financial obligations are considered to represent known future cash payments that UNIFI is required to make under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. 
 There have been no material changes in the scheduled maturities of UNIFI s contractual obligations as disclosed under the heading Contractual Obligations in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2024 Form 10-K. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 UNIFI is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on UNIFI s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital expenditures. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 UNIFI s critical accounting policies are discussed in the 2024 Form 10-K. There have been no changes to UNIFI s critical accounting policies in fiscal 2025. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 UNIFI is exposed to market risks associated with changes in interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and raw material and commodity costs, which may adversely affect its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. UNIFI does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, nor is it a party to any leveraged financial instruments. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 UNIFI is exposed to interest rate risk through its borrowing activities. As of September 29, 2024, UNIFI had borrowings under its ABL Facility that totaled 123,100. UNIFI s sensitivity analysis indicates that a 50-basis point interest rate increase as of September 29, 2024 would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 700. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 A complete discussion of foreign currency exchange rate risk is included in the 2024 Form 10-K and is supplemented by the following disclosures. 
 21

 Other Risks 
 UNIFI is also exposed to geopolitical risk, including changing laws and regulations governing international trade, such as quotas, tariffs, and tax laws. The degree of impact and the frequency of these events cannot be predicted. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 29, 2024, an evaluation of the effectiveness of UNIFI s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) was performed under the supervision and with the participation of UNIFI s management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer. Based on that evaluation, UNIFI s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that UNIFI s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by UNIFI in its reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by UNIFI in the reports UNIFI files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to UNIFI s management, including its principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There were no changes in UNIFI s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 29, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, UNIFI s internal control over financial reporting.

With respect to all such lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, we record reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not believe that any of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We maintain liability insurance for certain risks that is subject to certain self-insurance limits.

Exhibit 10.1 

 [FORM OF] RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT 
 
 	This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this Agreement is made by and between Unifi, Inc., a New York corporation (the Company ), and [EMPLOYEE], a key employee (the Grantee of the Company. 
 
 WITNESSETH: 
 
 WHEREAS , the Company has adopted the Unifi, Inc. Second Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan, which became effective on October 29, 2020 and was further amended effective October 31, 2023 (the Plan ); and 
 
 WHEREAS , the Compensation Committee (the Committee of the Board of Directors (the Board of the Company has determined that it is desirable and in the best interests of the Company to grant to the Grantee Restricted Stock Units RSUs as an incentive for the Grantee to advance the interests of the Company; 
 
 NOW, THEREFORE , the parties agree as follows: 
 
 Section 1. Incorporation of Plan . The Plan is incorporated by reference and made a part of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be subject to the terms of the Plan, as the Plan may be amended from time to time, provided that any such amendment of the Plan must be made in accordance with Section 14 of the Plan. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan. 

Section 2. Grant of RSU; Notice of Grant. Pursuant to the Plan and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and therein, the Company has granted to the Grantee , and effective as of the Grant Date , a certain number of RSUs, all as set forth on the Notice of Grant attached hereto as Annex A, which Notice of Grant is incorporated by reference herein. 

Section 3. Terms of Restricted Stock Units . The RSUs granted under this Agreement are subject to the following terms, conditions and restrictions: 

(a)	 No Ownership . The Grantee shall not possess any incidents of ownership (including, without limitation, dividend and voting rights) in shares of the Company Stock in respect of the RSUs until such RSUs have been converted into shares of Company Stock and such shares have been distributed to the Grantee in the form of shares of Company Stock. 
 
 (b)	 Transfer of RSUs . Except as provided in this Section 3(b) , the RSUs and any interest therein may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution and subject to the conditions set forth in the Plan and this Agreement. Any attempt to 

transfer RSUs in contravention of this Section is void ab initio . RSUs shall not be subject to execution, attachment or other process. 
 
 (c)	 Vesting and Conversion of RSUs . If the Grantee remains in the continuous employment of the Company from the Grant Date through the applicable Vesting Date listed below, the last of which is the Final Vesting Date , the corresponding percentage of the total number of RSUs awarded under this Agreement will become fully vested. 

Vesting Date 
 Percentage of RSUs Vested 

[_______] 
 [_______] 

[_______] 
 [_______] 

[_______] 
 [_______] 

There shall be no vesting of the RSUs to result in a fraction under this vesting schedule. If the vesting schedule would otherwise result in a fractional RSU, such RSU shall be rounded up to the next whole number, subject to the next sentence with respect to the Final Vesting Date. If the number of vested RSUs is rounded up on any Vesting Date prior to the Final Vesting Date, the number of RSUs in which the Grantee becomes vested on the Final Vesting Date shall be adjusted so that the total number of vested RSUs equals the number of RSUs set forth in the Notice of Grant. 
 
 On each Vesting Date, the vested RSUs shall be converted into an equivalent number of shares of Company Stock, and all such shares of Company Stock will be distributed to the Grantee within 30 days following the applicable Vesting Date, subject to the following possible deferral election by the Grantee. The Grantee may irrevocably elect, on or before the Deferral Election Date indicated on Annex A , to instead receive distributions of shares of Company Stock upon the Grantee s separation from service (as such term is defined in Section 409A and described in Section 7 , a Separation from Service ), in either a single distribution or substantially equal annual distributions over a period of up to five years following the Grantee s Separation from Service. Such an election must be made by completing and submitting to the Company a Deferral Election Form in substantially the form included as part of Annex B hereto. 
 
 Upon any distribution of shares of Company Stock in respect of the RSUs, the Company shall (i) issue (or make available via electronic means) to the Grantee or the Grantee s personal representative a stock certificate representing such shares of Company Stock, or (ii) cause such number of shares to be registered in the name of the Grantee or the Grantee s personal representative via a book-entry or other share registry process that is effective to constitute the uncertificated delivery thereof, in either case free of any restrictions. 
 
 2 

(d)	 Additional Vesting Provisions . 
 
 (i)	If, prior to the Final Vesting Date, the Grantee dies or has a Separation from Service as a result of Disability, all RSUs shall become fully vested, converted into an equivalent number of shares of Company Stock and distributed to the Grantee in a single distribution within 30 days following the Grantee s death or such Separation from Service, as the case may be, in either case without regard to any distribution deferral election. 
 
 (ii)	If, after the Grantee attains age 65 but prior to the Final Vesting Date, the Grantee has a Separation from Service due to an involuntary termination by the Company without Cause (as defined below), all remaining unvested RSUs shall become fully vested, and all RSUs shall be converted into an equivalent number of shares of Company Stock and distributed to the Grantee in a single distribution within 30 days following such Separation from Service, without regard to any distribution deferral election. 
 
 (iii)	If, prior to the Final Vesting Date, Grantee has a Separation from Service for any reason not covered in Section 3(d)(i) or Section 3(d)(ii) above, then the Grantee shall forfeit any unvested RSUs and shall not be entitled to receive any shares of Company Stock under this Agreement with respect to such forfeited RSUs. 
 
 (iv)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall immediately forfeit all RSUs (whether or not vested) and any underlying shares of Company Stock for which distribution has been deferred pursuant to Section 3(c) upon the Grantee s Separation from Service for Cause, whether before or after the Final Vesting Date. 
 
 (v)	In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan), all RSUs shall become fully vested, be converted into shares of Company Stock and be immediately distributed to the Grantee in a single distribution within 30 days following the Change in Control, without regard to any distribution deferral election. 
 
 (vi)	For purposes of this Agreement, Cause means any of the following, as determined in good faith by the Committee: (A) an act of embezzlement, theft or misappropriation by the Grantee of any property of the Company or any Related Company; (B) any breach by the Grantee of any material provision of any material agreement to which the Grantee is a party with the Company or any Related Company that is not cured, to the extent the breach is susceptible to being cured, within fourteen (14) days after the Company gives express notice to the Grantee describing such breach; (C) gross negligence by the Grantee in the discharge of his or her lawful duties to the Company or any Related Company (after receiving express notice from the Company specifying the manner in which he or she is alleged to have been grossly negligent and having had the opportunity to cure the same within thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice); (D) any act by the Grantee constituting a felony or a crime that otherwise involves dishonesty or misrepresentation; (E) the Grantee s breach of any fiduciary duty, under applicable 
 3 

law, to the Company or any Related Company, regardless of whether such conduct constitutes gross negligence; or (F) any chemical or alcohol dependence by the Grantee that materially and adversely affects the performance of his or her duties or responsibilities to the Company or any Related Company. 
 Section 4. Equitable Adjustment . The aggregate number of shares of Company Stock subject to the RSUs shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Stock resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of shares or other capital adjustment, or the payment of a stock dividend or other increase or decrease in such shares, effected without the receipt of consideration by the Company, or other change in corporate or capital structure. The Committee shall make the foregoing changes and any other changes, including changes in the classes of securities available, to the extent reasonably necessary or desirable to preserve the intended benefits under this Agreement in the event of any other reorganization, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, extraordinary dividend or other distribution or similar transaction involving the Company. 

Section 5. Taxes . The Grantee, upon the distribution of the RSUs, shall pay to the Company in cash the amount of any Applicable Withholding Taxes as provided in the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee may satisfy the Applicable Withholding Taxes in whole or in part, by electing (a) to deliver to the Company shares of Company Stock owned by the Grantee at the time of the distribution, (b) to have the Company withhold a portion of the RSUs to which the Grantee would otherwise be entitled or (c) a combination of the foregoing. In the event that the Grantee does not notify the Company of the Grantee s preferred method of satisfaction of the Applicable Withholding Taxes for a given Vesting Date prior to such Vesting Date, the Company shall withhold a portion of the RSUs vesting on that Vesting Date to satisfy such Applicable Withholding Taxes. Any shares of Company Stock delivered or to be withheld in satisfaction of any tax obligation of the Grantee shall have a value equal to their Fair Market Value on the day the RSUs are distributed, as provided in the Plan. 

Section 6. No Right to Continued Employment . Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to confer upon the Grantee any right to continue in the employment of the Company. 

Section 7. Section 409A . 

(a)	It is intended that this Agreement comply in all respects with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations and other generally applicable guidance issued thereunder (collectively, Section 409A ), and this Agreement shall be interpreted for all purposes in accordance with this intent. 
 
 (b)	Notwithstanding any other term or provision of this Agreement (including any term or provision of the Plan incorporated herein by reference), the parties hereto agree that, from time to time, the Company may, without prior notice to or consent of the Grantee, amend this Agreement to the extent determined by the 
 4 

Company, in the exercise of its discretion in good faith, to be necessary or advisable to prevent the inclusion in the Grantee s gross income pursuant to the applicable Treasury Regulations of any compensation intended to be deferred hereunder. The Company shall notify the Grantee as soon as reasonably practicable of any such amendment affecting the Grantee. 
 
 (c)	If the amounts payable under this Agreement are subject to any taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A, the Grantee shall be solely liable for the payment of any such taxes, penalties or interest. 
 
 (d)	Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the time and method for payment of the RSUs as provided in Section 3 and the Deferral Election Form shall not be accelerated or delayed for any reason, unless to the extent necessary to comply with, or as may be permitted under, Section 409A. 
 
 (e)	If the Grantee is deemed on the date of a Separation from Service to be a specified employee (within the meaning of that term under Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code and determined using any identification methodology and procedure selected by the Company from time to time, or the default methodology and procedure specified under Code Section 409A, if none has been selected by the Company), then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A and that is paid as a result of the Grantee s Separation from Service, such payment or benefit shall not be made or provided prior to the date that is the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such Separation from Service of the Grantee, and (ii) the date of the Grantee s death (the Delay Period ). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this provision (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed to the Grantee in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. For purposes of Section 409A, a distribution of shares of Company Stock following conversion of an RSU shall constitute a payment thereof. 
 
 Section 8. Recoupment of RSUs/Shares of Stock . Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, all RSUs and underlying shares of Company Stock awarded pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to recoupment by the Company pursuant to the Company s Compensation Recoupment Policy, as it may be amended from time to time (or any successor policy thereto) (the Recoupment Policy ). The terms of the Recoupment Policy are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement. 

Section 9. General Matters . 

(a)	 Heirs and Successors . This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the Company and its successors and assigns, and upon any 
 5 

person acquiring, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or otherwise, all or substantially all of the Company s assets and business. Subject to the terms of the Plan, any benefits distributable to the Grantee under this Agreement that are not distributed at the time of the Grantee s death shall be distributed, at the time and in the form determined in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, to the beneficiary designated by the Grantee in writing filed with the Company in such form and at such time as the Committee shall require. If a deceased Grantee failed to designate a beneficiary, or if the designated beneficiary of the deceased Grantee dies before the Grantee or before complete distribution of the benefits due under this Agreement, the amounts to be distributed under this Agreement shall be distributed to the legal representative or representatives of the estate of the last to die of the Grantee and any designated beneficiary. 
 
 (b)	 Amendments by the Committee . The Committee may, at any time prior to the Final Vesting Date, amend this Agreement, provided that no amendment may, in the absence of written consent by the Grantee, adversely affect the rights of the Grantee under this Agreement prior to the date of such amendment.

 (e)	 Resolution of Disputes . Any disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator, to be held in North Carolina in accordance with the commercial rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award by the arbitrator shall be final and subject to appeal only to the extent permitted by law. Each party shall bear such party s own expenses incurred in connection with any arbitration; provided , however , that the cost of the arbitration to the Grantee, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees of the Grantee, shall be borne by the Company if the Grantee is the prevailing party in the arbitration. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, each party hereto has the right to proceed with a court action for injunctive relief or relief from violations of law not within the jurisdiction of an arbitrator. If any costs of the arbitration borne by the Company in accordance herewith would constitute compensation to the Grantee for Federal tax purposes, then (i) the amount of any such costs reimbursed to the Grantee in one taxable year shall not affect the amount of such costs reimbursable to the Grantee in any other taxable year, (ii) the Grantee s right to reimbursement of any such costs shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit, and (iii) the reimbursement of any such costs incurred by the Grantee shall be made as soon as 
 6 

administratively practicable, but in any event within ten (10) days, after the date the Grantee is determined to be the prevailing party in the arbitration. The Grantee shall be responsible for submitting claims for reimbursement in a timely manner to enable payment within the timeframe provided herein.

 (g)	 Failure to Enforce Not a Waiver . The failure of either party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of such provision or of any other provision hereof. 
 
 (h)	 Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall represent one and the same agreement.

Unless otherwise defined herein or in the attached Deferral Election Form, capitalized terms have the meanings given them in the Agreement, which also includes Annex A attached thereto. 
 	 
 	Payment of RSUs is made in shares of Company Stock after the vesting of the RSUs as described in the Agreement. You are taxed at ordinary income rates on the value of the shares of Company Stock at the time of such payment, which is the time that shares are distributed to you pursuant to the Agreement. Following such a distribution, you can sell some or all the shares at any time, subject to any applicable securities law restrictions. Or, in connection with a distribution, you can choose to have the Company withhold an appropriate number of the shares to satisfy your tax obligation. 
 
 	As a general rule, your vested RSUs under the Agreement will be converted to shares of Company Stock that will be distributed to you in a single distribution within 30 days following the applicable Vesting Date. However, under Section 3(c) of the Agreement, you may elect instead to defer receipt of such shares of Company Stock until your Separation from Service, and then have the shares distributed to you in either a single distribution or substantially equal annual distributions over a period of up to five years following your Separation from Service. Such an election must be made by completing and submitting to the Company the attached Deferral Election Form on or before the Deferral Election Date. 
 
 	However, if you become vested in your RSUs prior to a Vesting Date due to certain Separation from Service events as described in Section 3(d) of this Agreement or a Change in Control of the Company, you will receive your shares of Company Stock in a single distribution within 30 days following the date of such event, regardless of any deferral election that you may have made. 
 
 	There may be advantages and disadvantages to making a deferral election, depending on your individual situation and future events, including future tax rates. You should consider your particular tax and financial situation before making a deferral election. You are encouraged to consult your personal tax or financial planning advisor in making a decision.

 	Payment of PSUs is made in shares of Company Stock after the vesting of the PSUs as described in the Agreement.

Or, in connection with a distribution, you can choose to have the Company withhold an appropriate number of the shares to satisfy your tax obligation. 
 
 	As a general rule, your vested PSUs under the Agreement will be converted to shares of Company Stock that will be distributed to you in a single distribution within 30 days following the applicable Vesting Date. However, under Section 3(c) of the Agreement, you may elect instead to defer receipt of such shares of Company Stock until your Separation from Service, and then have the shares distributed to you in either a single distribution or substantially equal annual distributions over a period of up to five years following your Separation from Service. Such an election must be made by completing and submitting to the Company the attached Deferral Election Form on or before the Deferral Election Date. 
 
 	However, if you become vested in your PSUs prior to the Vesting Date due to certain Separation from Service events as described in Section 3(d)(i) of this Agreement or a Change in Control of the Company, you will receive your shares of Company Stock in a single distribution within 30 days following the date of such event, regardless of any deferral election that you may have made. 
 
 	There may be advantages and disadvantages to making a deferral election, depending on your individual situation and future events, including future tax rates. You should consider your particular tax and financial situation before making a deferral election. You are encouraged to consult your personal tax or financial planning advisor in making a decision.
