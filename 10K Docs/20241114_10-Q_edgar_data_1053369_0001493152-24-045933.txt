Significant
management judgment is required to determine the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the Company
expects to complete its performance obligations under the arrangement. If the Company cannot reasonably estimate when its performance
obligations either are completed or become inconsequential, then revenue recognition is deferred until the Company can reasonably make
such estimates. Revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance using the cumulative catch-up method. 

When
determining the transaction price of a contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before
or significantly after performance, resulting in a significant financing component. Applying the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-32-18,
the Company does not assess whether a significant financing component exists if the period between when the Company performs its obligations
under the contract and when the customer pays is one year or less. None of the Company s contracts contained a significant financing
component as of September 30, 2024. 

In
accordance with ASC 606-10-55-65, royalties are recognized when the subsequent sale of the customer s products occurs. 

c)
 Sale of product under the Elite label 

The
Company began direct sales of products under the Company s own label on April 1, 2023. License agreements will remain in place
for select products. With this transition, however, a large portion of the manufacturing and license fees have been replaced with revenues
from sales of Elite labeled pharmaceutical products to distributors for pharmacies and institutions. 

The
Company recognizes revenue when the customer obtains control of the Company s product based on the contractual shipping terms,
at which time the performance obligation is deemed to be completed. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to
deliver the product and bears risk of loss while the inventory is in-transit to the purchaser. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration
earned from the sale of Elite labeled pharmaceutical products are recorded at their net realizable value which consists of gross amounts
invoiced reduced by contractual reductions, including, without limitation, chargebacks, discounts and program rebates, as applicable. 

The
Company provides for chargebacks to wholesalers for sales to various end-customers to include, but not limited to, hospitals, group purchasing
organizations, and pharmacies. Chargebacks represent the difference between the price the wholesaler pays and the price that the end-customer
pays for a product. The company s estimate for chargebacks is developed based upon management s assumption of anticipated
product returns, other rebates, as well as historical information.

ASC
820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market
participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s
own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable
inputs). 

The
fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value
hierarchy under ASC 820 are described as follows: 

Level
 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. 

Level
 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
 or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical
 or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset
 or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level
 3 Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.

See
Note 10 for specific inputs used in determining fair value. 

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other
current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Based upon current borrowing rates with similar maturities the carrying value of long-term debt, and related party loans payable approximates
fair value. 

Non-Financial
Assets that are Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 

Non-financial
assets such as intangible assets, and property and equipment are measured at fair value only when an impairment loss is recognized. The
Company did not record an impairment charge related to these assets in the periods presented.

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segments, which aims
to improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public
entities to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses. Currently, Topic 280 requires that a public entity disclose
certain information about its reportable segments. Topic 280 also requires other specified segment items and amounts to be disclosed
under certain circumstances. The amendments in this ASU do not change or remove those disclosure requirements and do not change how a
public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine
its reportable segments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the requirements of ASU 2023 
07 will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Management
has evaluated recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a significant
impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

described in this note below. 

The
Company has total warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of 
as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. 

On
April 28, 2017, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with Hakim, the Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive
Officer of the Company, pursuant to which the Company issued to Hakim shares of its Series J Preferred and warrants to purchase
an aggregate of shares of its Common Stock (the Series J Warrants and, along with the Series J Preferred issued
to Hakim, the Securities in exchange for shares of Common Stock owned by Hakim. The fair value of the Series
J Warrants was determined to be upon issuance at April 28, 2017. 

The
Series J Warrants are exercisable for a period of years from the date of issuance, commencing April 28, 2020. The initial exercise
price is per share and the Series J Warrants can be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, including a provision within that
provides the holder a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares upon a cashless exercise. The net cash settlement amount
is the cash value obtained by subtracting the then exercise price from the closing price of the Company s Common Stock (provided
such closing price is higher than the exercise price) and multiplying the difference by the number of shares exercised. As this event
is at the holder s option, it is considered outside of the Company s control. As a result of the net cash settlement at the
option of the holder, such warrants are classified as liabilities and measured initially and subsequently at fair value. 

The
exercise price is subject to adjustment for any issuances or deemed issuances of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents at an effective
price below the then exercise price. The Series J Warrants also provide for other standard adjustments upon the happening of certain
customary events.

Options 

Under
its 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and its 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, the Company did grant and may grant stock options to officers, selected
employees, as well as members of the Board of Directors and advisory board members. On July 1, 2024 the Company restated the 2014 Equity
Incentive Plan to increase the shares reserved under the option plan by . All options have generally been granted at a price
equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company s Common Stock at the date of the grant. Generally, options are granted
with a vesting period of up to three years and expire ten years from the date of grant. 

The
fair value of option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The exercise price of each
award is generally not less than the per share fair value in effect as of that award date. The determination of fair value using the
Black-Scholes model is affected by the Company s share fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective
variables, including expected price volatility, risk-free interest rate and projected employee share option exercise behaviors. The Company
estimates its expected volatility by using a combination of historical share price volatilities of similar companies within our industry.
The expected term of the Company s stock options for employees has been determined utilizing the simplified method
for awards, since the Company does not have sufficient exercise history to estimate term of its historical option awards. The risk-free
interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the
Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

The
grant date fair value of option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. No options were issued the six months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

elsewhere in this report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties,
such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors
appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. We use words such as anticipate, estimate,

Unless
expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms Elite , the Company , we , us ,
and our refer to Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and subsidiary. 

Background 

Elite
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the Company , Elite , Elite Pharmaceuticals , the
 registrant , we , us or our was incorporated on October 1, 1997 under the laws
of the State of Delaware, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Elite Laboratories, Inc. Elite Labs ), was incorporated on August
23, 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware. On January 5, 2012, Elite Pharmaceuticals was reincorporated under the laws of the
State of Nevada. 

We
are a specialty pharmaceutical company principally engaged in the development and manufacture of oral, controlled-release products, and
the manufacture of generic pharmaceuticals. Our strategy includes developing generic versions of controlled-release drug products with
high barriers to entry. 

We
occupy manufacturing, warehouse, laboratory and office space at 135, 144 and 165 Ludlow Avenue in Northvale, NJ (the Northvale
Facility ). The Northvale Facility operates under Current Good Manufacturing Practice and is a United States Drug Enforcement Agency
registered facility for research, development, and manufacturing. We are also party to an operating lease for office space at Pompano
Beach, Florida (the Pompano Office Lease ). 

Strategy 

We
focus our efforts on the following areas: (i) manufacturing of a line of generic pharmaceutical products with approved Abbreviated New
Drug Applications ANDAs (ii) development of additional generic pharmaceutical products; (iii) development of the other
product candidates in our pipeline including products co-developed with partners; (iv) commercial exploitation of our products
either by sales under our own label, license and the collection of royalties, or through the manufacture of our formulations; and (v)
development of new products for sale under our own label, and the expansion of our licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies,
including co-development projects, joint ventures and other collaborations. 

Our
focus is on the development of various types of drug products, including generic drug products which require ANDAs as well as branded
drug products which require New Drug Applications NDAs under Section 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition
and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. 

We
believe that our business strategy enables us to reduce its risk by having a diverse product portfolio that includes generic products
in various therapeutic categories and to build collaborations and establish licensing agreements with companies with greater resources
thereby allowing us to share costs of development and improve cash-flow.

SequestOx 
- Immediate Release Oxycodone with sequestered Naltrexone 

SequestOx 
is our abuse-deterrent candidate for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate. SequestOx 
is an immediate-release Oxycodone Hydrochloride containing sequestered Naltrexone which incorporates 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 30mg doses
of oxycodone into capsules. 

In
January 2016, the Company submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application for SequestOx , after receiving a waiver of the 2.3 million
filing fee from the FDA. In March 2016, the Company received notification of the FDA s acceptance of this filing and that such
filing has been granted priority review by the FDA with a target action under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of July 14, 2016. 

2 

On
July 15, 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, regarding the NDA. The CRL stated that the review cycle for the SequestOx 
NDA is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its present form. 

On
July 7, 2017, the Company reported topline results from a pivotal bioequivalence fed study for or SequestOx . The mean Tmax (the
amount of time that a drug is present at the maximum concentration in serum) of SequestOx was 4.6 hr. with a range of 0.5 hr.
to 12 hr. and the mean Tmax of the comparator, Roxicodone , was 3.4 hr. with a range of 0.5 hr. to 12 hr. A key objective for the
study was to determine if the reformulated SequestOx had a similar Tmax to the comparator when taken with a high fat meal. Based
on these results, the Company paused clinical trials for this formulation of SequestOx . On January 30, 2018, the Company reported
positive topline results from a pilot study conducted for a modified SequestOx wherein, based on the results of this pilot study,
the modified SequestOx formulation is expected to achieve bioequivalence with a Tmax range equivalent to the reference product
when conducted in a pivotal trial under fed conditions. The Company has provided the pilot data to the FDA, requesting clarification
as to the requirements for resubmission of the NDA. The FDA has provided guidance for repeated bio-equivalence studies in order to bridge
the new formulation to the original SequestOx studies and also extended our filing fee waiver until July 2023. Due to the prohibitive
cost of such repeated bio-equivalence studies and the uncertain commercial viability given the regulatory and competitive landscape,
the Company has paused development of this product candidate. 

There
can be no assurances of the Company conducting future clinical trials, or if such trials are conducted, there can be no assurances of
the success of any future clinical trials, or if such trials are successful, there can be no assurances that an intended future resubmission
of the NDA product filing, if made, will be accepted by or receive marketing approval from the FDA. In addition, even if marketing authorization
is received, there can be no assurances that there will be future revenues or profits, or that any such future revenues or profits would
be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure this marketing authorization.

Company did not transfer or discontinue any ANDAs during the quarterly period ending September 30, 2024 or Fiscal 2024. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP, and our discussion
and analysis of the Company s financial condition and operating results require our management to make judgments, assumptions and
estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results
may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. We have identified below the critical accounting policies, which
are assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain and that are of critical importance in the presentation of
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are
inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a
regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation our financial statements. 

Revenue
Recognition - The Company generates revenue from manufacturing and sales of generic pharmaceuticals
bearing either the Elite label, which are sold to pharmaceutical distributors or the label of a licensing partner, which Elite sells directly
to such licensing partner, and licensing fees. Revenues earned from the sale of Elite label products are recorded at their net realizable
value which consists of gross amounts invoiced reduced by contractual reductions, including, without limitation, chargebacks, discounts
and program rebates, as applicable. Licensing fees include the commercialization of products either by license and the collection of royalties,
or the expansion of licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies, including co-development projects, joint ventures and other
collaborations. 

Nature
of goods and services 

The
following is a description of the Company s goods and services from which the Company generates revenue, as well as the nature,
timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and significant payment terms for each, as applicable: 

a)
Manufacturing Fees 

The
Company is equipped to manufacture immediate and controlled-release products marketed under the Elite label, or manufactured on a contract
basis for third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when the customer obtains control of the Company s product based on the
contractual shipping terms of the contract, at which time the performance obligation is deemed to be completed. The Company is primarily
responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the product, is responsible to ensure that the product is produced in accordance with
the related supply agreement and bears risk of loss while the inventory is in-transit to the commercial partner. Revenue is measured
as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products to a customer. 

b)
License Fees 

The
Company enters into licensing and development agreements, which may include multiple revenue generating activities, including milestones
payments, licensing fees, product sales and services. The Company analyzes each element of its licensing and development agreements in
accordance with ASC 606 to determine appropriate revenue recognition. The terms of the license agreement may include payment to the Company
of licensing fees, non-refundable upfront license fees, milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved, and/or royalties on
product sales. 

If
the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation.
Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price based on the estimated relative
standalone selling prices of the promised products or services underlying each performance obligation. The Company determines standalone
selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable
through past transactions, the Company estimates the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market
conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. 

The
Company recognizes revenue from non-refundable upfront payments at a point in time, typically upon fulfilling the delivery of the associated
intellectual property to the customer. For those milestone payments which are contingent on the occurrence of particular future events
(for example, payments due upon a product receiving FDA approval), the Company determined that these need to be considered for inclusion
in the calculation of total consideration from the contract as a component of variable consideration using the most-likely amount method.
As such, the Company assesses each milestone to determine the probability and substance behind achieving each milestone. Given the inherent
uncertainty of the occurrence of future events, the Company will recognize revenue from the milestone when there is not a high probability
of a reversal of revenue, which typically occurs near or upon achievement of the event. 

4 

Significant
management judgment is required to determine the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the Company
expects to complete its performance obligations under the arrangement. If the Company cannot reasonably estimate when its performance
obligations either are completed or become inconsequential, then revenue recognition is deferred until the Company can reasonably make
such estimates. Revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance using the cumulative catch-up method. 

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Expected Credit Losses Accounts receivable are comprised of balances due from customers, net
of estimated allowances for expected credit losses, and other contractual deductions, including, without limitation, chargebacks, discounts
and program rebates. In determining collectability, historical trends are evaluated, and specific customer issues are reviewed on a periodic
basis to arrive at appropriate allowances. 

The
allowance for expected credit losses is based on the probability of future collection under the current expected credit loss CECL impairment model under Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement
of Credit Losses on Financial Assets, which was adopted by the Company on April 1, 2023. Under the CECL impairment model, the Company
determines its allowance by applying a loss-rate method based on an aging schedule using the Company s historical loss rate. The
Company also considers reasonable and supportable current information in determining its estimated loss rate, such as external forecasts,
macroeconomic trends or other factors, including customers credit risk and historical loss experience. The adequacy of the allowance
is evaluated on a regular basis. Account balances are written off after all means of collection are exhausted and the balance is deemed
to be uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance. Changes in the allowance are recorded as adjustments to credit
losses in the period incurred. Expected credit losses stemming from unbilled receivables expected to billed between September 30, 2024
and September 30, 2028 included additional risk premiums estimated based on factors such as projected inflation, projected decreases
in GDP, and projected unemployment. 

Income
Taxes - Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect
for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Where applicable, the Company records a valuation
allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets that it determines will not be realizable in the future. 

The
Company recognizes the benefit of an uncertain tax position that it has taken or expects to take on income tax returns it files if such
tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
These tax benefits are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. 

The
Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions within the United States of America. The Company remains subject to examination in all
tax jurisdictions until the applicable statutes of limitation expire. As of September 30, 2024, a summary of the tax years that
remain subject to examination in our major tax jurisdictions are: United States of America Federal, 2020 and forward, and State,
2019 and forward. The Company did not record unrecognized tax positions for the six months ended September 30, 2024.

Total
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 4.7 million or 33 , to 18.9 million, as compared to 14.2 million,
for the corresponding period of the prior year, , primarily due to increased sales of the Elite label products during the current quarter
in comparison to the comparable quarter of the prior fiscal year. The Elite label products were launched during the prior fiscal year
and the current fiscal year represents their second year in the market. The additional twelve months of marketing the Elite label products
has had a positive impact on sales, when compared to the sales achieved in the comparable period of the prior year. 

Manufacturing
fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 revenue increased by 4.7 million, or 35 , primarily due to increased sales of the
Elite label products during the current fiscal year in comparison to the comparable quarter of the prior fiscal year. The Elite label
products were launched during the prior fiscal year and the current fiscal year represents their second year in the market. The additional
twelve months of marketing the Elite label products has had a positive impact on sales, when compared to the sales achieved in the comparable
period of the prior year. 

Licensing
fees revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was relatively unchanged, increasing by less than 1 as compared to licensing
fees earned during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. 

Cost
of manufacturing consists of manufacturing and assembly costs. Our cost of revenue increased by 3.0 million or 39 , to 10.7 million
as compared to 7.7 million for the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. This increase was due to an increased volume of products
sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the comparable period of the prior fiscal year, as noted above. 

Our
gross profit margin was 43 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 46 during the comparable period of the
prior fiscal year. The decrease is due to increased labor costs resulting from manufacturing personnel overtime hours incurred to
ensure production and supply of our products in response to increased demand. In addition, during the three months ended September
30, 2024, manufacturing fees represented a higher proportion of total revenue, as compared to licensing fees. Manufacturing fees
generate lower gross profit margins as compared to licensing fees, due to it having a related cost of manufacturing, which is not
associated with licensing fees. The Company is in the process of expanding its manufacturing facilities and capacity to achieve
utilization rates that will yield higher volumes at standard labor rates.

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.2 million, or 4 , to 4.7 million as compared to 4.5 million
for the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year, largely due to an increase in general and administrative costs of 0.7 million. 

Research
and development costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.0 million, a decrease of 0.65 million, or 25 , from approximately
 2.6 million of such costs for the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease was the result of laboratory resources being allocated
more to supporting commercial operations as well as the number, timing and nature of product development activities during the three
months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. 

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.3 million, an increase of 0.7 million or approximately
48 from the comparable period of the prior fiscal year, largely due to increased human resource costs resulting from increased headcounts
as well as increased costs of financial and tax reporting compliance as compared to the comparable period of the prior year. 

Non-cash
compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was less than 0.1 million. 

Depreciation
and amortization expenses from the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.4 million, which increased slightly as a result of
additional capital expenditures and ASC 842 finance assets acquired, from 0.3 million in such costs for the comparable period of
the prior fiscal year. 

As
a result of the foregoing, our income from operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.5 million, compared to
income from operations of 1.9 million for the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.

Other income (expenses) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a net other (expense) 13.0 million, an increase of 8.3 million from a net
other (expense) of 4.7 million for the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 10.3
million relating to the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments, offset by a decrease of other expenses of 2.1 million
relating to the change in fair value of stock-based liabilities and by a slight increase in other expenses of 0.1 million relating to
the interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs in the current fiscal year as compared to the comparable period of the prior
fiscal year. The change in the fair value of derivative instruments and stock-based liabilities is determined in large part by the change
in the closing price of the Company s Common Stock as of the end of the period, as compared to the closing price at the beginning
of the period, with a strong inverse relationship between the other income expense recorded from changes in the fair value of our derivatives
instruments and stock-based liabilities and changes in the closing price of the Company s Common Stock. The increase in interest
expense associated with the loans payable is due to the Company servicing a larger principal amount of loans payable during the three
months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the comparable period of the prior fiscal year

As
a result of the foregoing, our net loss before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.5 million, compared

Cost
of manufacturing consists of manufacturing and assembly costs. Our cost of revenue increased by 9.1 million or 76 , to 21.0 million
as compared to 11.9 million for the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. This increase was due to an increased volume of products
sold during the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the comparable period of the prior fiscal year, as noted above. 

Our
gross profit margin was 44 during the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 48 during the comparable period of the
prior fiscal year. The decrease is due to increased labor costs resulting from manufacturing personnel overtime hours incurred to
ensure production and supply of our products in response to increased demand. In addition, during the six months ended September 30,

NJEDA
Bonds 

On
August 31, 2005, the Company successfully completed a refinancing of a prior 1999 bond issue through the issuance of new tax-exempt bonds
(the Bonds ). The refinancing involved borrowing 4,155,000, evidenced by a 6.5 Series A Note in the principal amount of
 3,660,000 maturing on September 1, 2030 and a 9 Series B Note in the principal amount of 495,000 maturing on September 1, 2012. The
net proceeds, after payment of issuance costs, were used (i) to redeem the outstanding tax-exempt Bonds originally issued by the Authority
on September 2, 1999, (ii) refinance other equipment financing and (iii) for the purchase of certain equipment to be used in the manufacture
of pharmaceutical products. As of March 31, 2016, all of the proceeds were utilized by the Company for such stated purposes. 

Interest
is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The Bonds are collateralized by a first lien on the Company s
facility and equipment acquired with the proceeds of the original and refinanced Bonds. The related Indenture requires the maintenance
of a Debt Service Reserve Fund of 366,000 in relation to the Series A Notes. 

Bond
issue costs of 354,454 were paid from the bond proceeds and are being amortized over the life of the bonds. Amortization of bond issuance
costs amounted to 7,089 for the six months ended September 30, 2024. 

The
NJEDA Bonds require the Company to make an annual principal payment on September 1st of varying amounts as specified in the loan documents
and semi-annual interest payments on March 1st and September 1st, equal to interest due on the outstanding principal at the applicable
rate for the semi-annual period just ended. 

In
addition, the Company had previously received Notices of Default from the Trustee of the NJEDA Bonds as a result of the utilization of
the debt service reserve being used to pay interest payments as well as the company s failure to make scheduled principal payments.
All monetary defaults were cured during Fiscal 2015 and the Company is current on all NJEDA Bond interest and principal payments. 

As
of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there are no interest or principal amounts in arrears. The Series B Notes

As

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, refers to controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s
management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and such information is accumulated
and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Internal
control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are achieved. Further, the design
of a control system must be balanced against resource constraints, and therefore the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Given the inherent limitations in all systems of controls, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls.
The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly,
given the inherent limitations in a cost-effective system of internal control, financial statement misstatements due to error or fraud
may occur and may not be detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance
of achieving their objectives. We conduct periodic evaluations of our systems of controls to enhance, where necessary, our control policies
and procedures. 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) 
published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting. Based on its evaluation, the Company has concluded that due to the material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting noted below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 at the reasonable
assurance level. 

We were unable to formalize and implement revised controls, policies and procedure documentation to evidence a system of internal controls,
including testing of such revised controls, that was consistent with available personnel and resources; 

We failed to maintain effective control activities over our control environment, risk assessment, information technology and monitoring
components; and 

We had insufficient segregation of duties, oversight of work performed and lack of compensating controls in our finance and accounting
functions due to limited personnel and resources. 

Remediation
efforts to address material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting 

We
intend to revise the existing control environment documentation, designing and implementing controls, policies and procedure documentation
that is consistent with our current personnel, resources and capabilities, with significant focus on controls relating to financial oversight,
management, analysis and reporting of operations emanating from the Company s manufacturing, marketing and distribution of its
Elite Laboratory label product line. Please note that these material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the applicable
remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time, allowing management, through testing, to reach a conclusion on such controls
design and operational effectiveness. 

Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the six months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Pending
Litigation 

Elite filed a paragraph IV certification with its ANDA to generic Oxycontin

Act. This was followed by a patent infringement suit filed in the District Court of New Jersey by Purdue Pharma. Elite obtained agreement
with Purdue to stay the litigation for six months. Elite s launch of a generic Oxycontin will depend upon approval by the FDA and
on the outcome of various litigations involving Purdue or the expiry of the patents listed on the Orange Book. Elite and Purdue agreed
to a stay of the litigation for six months which the court ordered on January 17, 2024. The stay was extended for an additional six months
by an order from the court on July 15, 2024. During the additional six months a decision was rendered in the Purdue Pharma L.P. v.
Accord Healthcare Inc. , Civil Action No. 22-913-WCB Accord II on September 9, 2024 which according to the order
required Elite and Purdue to submit a joint report to the court. On September 26, 2024, the court ordered that proceedings in the Elite
