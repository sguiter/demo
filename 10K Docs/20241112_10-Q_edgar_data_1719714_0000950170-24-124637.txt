The expected volatility assumption is calculated by reference to the historical volatility of an appropriate peer group of companies for a period equal to the expected term of the Option. The grant date fair value is recognized over the vesting period using the accelerated graded-vesting attribution method. Deferred Restricted Stock Units DRSUs Non-executive directors may voluntarily elect to convert their annual cash fees for services on the board of directors and DRSUs were granted to those who made such elections. The number of DRSUs granted is determined by dividing the amount of the annual cash compensation by the average closing trading price of the Company's ADSs over the most recent 30 trading days as of the date of grant. Each DRSU entitles the holder to receive an ADS at no cost upon the completion of the vesting period. DRSUs granted under the 2019 NED EIP vest in substantially equal monthly installments over the plan year. Payment of DRSUs in ADSs will generally be days following separation of service but have no specified contractual term.

The Company s potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 would be to reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share is the same.

Upon execution of the Amended AstraZeneca License Agreement, the Company committed to issue ordinary shares and pay million to AstraZeneca in respect of an agreed milestone. Under the terms of the Amended AstraZeneca Agreements, the Company has agreed, in connection with certain further development and regulatory milestones, to make potential future payments both in cash and through the issue of a variable number of additional ADSs to AstraZeneca of up to million in the aggregate for products included in the Amended AstraZeneca License Agreement. The number of ADSs to be issued to satisfy equity milestones is determined by dividing a monetary amount by a defined subscription price (the Subscription Price ). In addition, the Company has agreed to make payments to AstraZeneca based on specified commercial milestones of the product. The Company has also agreed to pay a specified percentage of sub-licensing revenue to AstraZeneca and to make royalty payments to AstraZeneca equal to ascending specified percentages of tiered annual worldwide net sales by the Company of licensed products (subject to certain reductions), ranging from the high single digits to low double digits. Royalties will be payable on a licensed-product-by-licensed-product and country-by-country basis until the later of ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country and expiration of the last patent covering such licensed product in such country that would be sufficient to prevent generic entry. The Company has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product. The Amended AstraZeneca License Agreement will expire on the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term with respect to all licensed products. Upon the expiration of the royalty term for a licensed product in a particular country, the licenses to the Company for such product in such country will become fully paid and irrevocable. Prior to exercise of the Option, if at all, the Company may terminate the Amended AstraZeneca License Agreement upon prior written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement upon prior written notice for the other party s material breach that remains uncured for a specified period of time or insolvency.

Item 2. Management s Discu ssion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our 2023 Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of our 2023 Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. 
 Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of innovative therapeutics for rare diseases. We have developed a portfolio of late-stage clinical product candidates. Our two rare disease product candidates are setrusumab for the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and alvelestat primarily for the treatment of severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease (AATD-LD). Setrusumab has received orphan designation for OI from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), PRIME designation from the EMA and has rare pediatric disease designation and breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. Alvelestat has received U.S. Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of AATD and Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of AATD-LD. 
 Our strategy is to selectively acquire and develop product candidates for rare diseases that have already received significant investment from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and that have substantial pre-clinical, clinical and manufacturing data packages. Since our formation in March 2015, we have successfully executed this strategy by acquiring six clinical-stage product candidates of which four were in rare diseases and oncology. Four of our six clinical-stage product candidates were acquired from large pharmaceutical companies and two were acquired in our merger with OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc in 2019. We have successfully completed large, randomized Phase 2 clinical trials for four of our product candidates and the Phase 1b portion of a Phase 1b/2 for a fifth product candidate. 
 Rare diseases represent an attractive development and, in some cases, commercialization opportunity for us since they typically have high unmet medical need and can utilize regulatory pathways that facilitate acceleration to approval and to the potential market. Development of products for rare diseases involves close collaboration with key opinion leaders and investigators, and close coordination with patient organizations. Rare disease patients are typically treated at a limited number of specialized sites which helps identification of the patient population and enables a small, targeted sales infrastructure to commercialize the products in key markets.

Total R D expenses decreased by 0.4 million, or 12 , from 3.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The decrease was primarily due to reductions in R D expenses of 0.6 million and 0.4 million for etigilimab and alvelestat, respectively, partially offset by an increase of 0.4 million for setrusumab. 
 
 22 

The reduction in program expenses for etigilimab was primarily due to the winding down and completion during 2023 of the open label Phase 1b/2 basket study in combination with an anti-PD-1 in a range of tumor types. 
 The reduction in the program expenses for alvelestat primarily relates to lower levels of preparatory activity undertaken in respect of the Phase 3 study in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023, particularly including manufacturing and drug formulation activities and regulatory interactions. 
 The increase in program expenses for setrusumab was driven by additional activities in Europe and resources for input into development, regulatory and manufacturing plans with our partner, Ultragenyx, as the global development program is funded by Ultragenyx pursuant to our license and collaboration agreement. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 0.5 million, or 9 , from 5.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase primarily reflects 0.2 million higher pre-commercial activities to lay the foundation for the commercial launch of setrusumab in Europe, including those to support pricing and reimbursement by HTA authorities and payor decision-makers in Europe. The remaining increase represents increases in various corporate expenses. 
 Interest income and expense 
 Interest income increased 0.3 million, or 43 , from 0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was principally due to a higher cash and cash equivalents balance in the quarter from the proceeds of the underwritten registered direct offering in June 2024. 
 Interest expense decreased 0.3 million, or 49 , from 0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was principally due to the lower balance in the quarter of convertible loan notes as the private placement loan notes were fully converted and redeemed in August 2023. 
 Foreign currency transaction gain/(loss) 
 The net foreign exchange loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.4 million, compared to a gain of 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change primarily reflects (i) the impact of a weakening in the value of U.S. dollars when translating U.S. dollar balances into our functional currency of pound sterling in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a strengthening of U.S. dollars in the three months ended September 30, 2023, and (ii) higher U.S. dollar balances following the underwritten registered direct offering in June 2024. 
 Other comprehensive income Foreign currency translation adjustments 
 The foreign currency translation adjustment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a gain of 7.2 million, compared to a loss of 3.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change primarily reflects the impact of the significant weakening of U.S. dollars when translating the net assets of the Company from its functional currency (pound sterling) into its presentational currency (U.S. dollars).

 No revenue was recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue of 9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 comprised a one-time milestone payment of 9.0 million resulting from the achievement of a clinical milestone on setrusumab by Ultragenyx. 
 Cost of revenue 
 No cost of revenue was recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cost of revenue of 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily represents amounts payable pursuant to our 2015 agreement with Novartis, under which the Company pays a percentage of proceeds resulting from milestone revenue received, subject to certain deductions and other amounts, on the achievement of clinical milestones.

Total R D expenses decreased by 0.5 million, or 4 , from 12.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 12.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The decrease was primarily due to a 3.9 million reduction in R D expenses for etigilimab, partially offset by increases of 1.8 million and 1.6 million for alvelestat and setrusumab, respectively. 
 The decrease in program expenses for etigilimab was primarily due to the winding down and completion during 2023 of the open label Phase 1b/2 basket study in combination with an anti-PD-1 in a range of tumor types. 
 The increase in program expenses for alvelestat primarily relates to preparatory work for the Phase 3 study, including manufacturing and drug formulation activities, St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) validation activities and regulatory interactions. 
 The increase in program expenses for setrusumab was driven by additional activities in Europe, and resources for the input into development, regulatory and manufacturing plans with our partner, Ultragenyx, as the global development program is funded by Ultragenyx pursuant to our license and collaboration agreement. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 5.2 million, or 35 , from 14.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 20.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The increase was primarily due to: 
 (i) pre-commercial activities to lay the foundation for the commercial launch of setrusumab in Europe, including those to support pricing and reimbursement by HTA authorities and payor decision-makers in Europe of 1.4 million; 

(ii) net increases in other general and administrative expenses of approximately 1.9 million, including employee-related costs, and legal and professional fees in respect of compliance with the U.S. domestic reporting regime; and 

(iii) a reduction of 1.7 million in the amount received from our depository to reimburse certain expenses incurred by us in respect of our ADR program in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest income and expense 
 Interest income increased 0.8 million, or 58 , from 1.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was principally due to higher cash and cash equivalents balances from the proceeds of the underwritten registered direct offering in June 2024. 
 25 

Interest expense decreased 1.5 million, or 61 , from 2.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was principally due to the lower balance of convertible loan notes in the period as the private placement loan notes were fully converted and redeemed in August 2023. 
 Changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
 Changes in the fair value of financial instruments were an unrealized loss of 0.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an unrealized gain of 0.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The unrealized loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the impact of the increase in the price of the Company's ADSs on the value of the warrant liabilities, whereas in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the unrealized gain was primarily due to the expiry of the Private Placement warrants in June 2023. 
 Foreign currency transaction gain/(loss) 
 The net foreign exchange loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.8 million, compared to a gain of 0.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change primarily reflects (i) the impact of a significant weakening in the value of U.S. dollars when translating U.S. dollar balances into our functional currency of pound sterling in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a slight strengthening of U.S. dollars in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and (ii) higher U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalent balances following the underwritten registered direct offering in June 2024. 
 Benefit from research and development tax credit 
 The benefit from research and development tax credit decreased by 0.1 million, from 1.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease reflects a combination of a lower level of qualifying expenditure in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a reduction in the proportion of qualifying expenditure that can be reclaimed under the scheme rules. The tax credits represent eligible cash rebates paid or receivable from the tax authorities in the jurisdictions within which we operate for eligible types of research and development activities and associated expenditure (the R D tax credit ). 
 Other comprehensive loss Foreign currency translation adjustments 
 The foreign currency translation adjustment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a gain of 6.4 million, compared to a gain of 0.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change primarily reflects the impact of the significant weakening of U.S. dollars when translating the net assets of the Company from its functional currency (pound sterling) into its presentational currency (U.S. dollars). 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Under the current business plan and cash flow forecasts, and in consideration of our ongoing research and development efforts and our general corporate funding requirements, we anticipate that our current on-hand cash resources will extend into 2027. However, we will need additional external funding to complete our development plans and potentially commercialize selected rare disease products. We plan to fund our operations through cash on hand and a combination of non-dilutive funding sources, public or private equity or debt financing or other sources. 
 We do not currently have any approved product candidates and as a result, have not generated any revenue from product sales. As a result, to date, we have financed our operations primarily through the issuances of our equity securities, convertible debt and warrants. These offerings have raised approximately 259.0 million, including through the 50.0 million underwritten registered direct offering in June 2024 and the 12.0 million at-the-market offering pursuant to our Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC in July 2023 (all amounts are gross proceeds before fees and discounts). 
 26 

We have also received payments under various license and collaboration agreements, including payments of: 
 50.0 million under the license and collaboration agreement with Ultragenyx for setrusumab in 2021 and a further milestone payment of 9.0 million in July 2023; 

4.0 million under the license and collaboration agreement with Feng Biosciences (formerly OncXerna) for navicixizumab in 2020 and a further milestone payment of 2.0 million in 2022; and 

1.0 million under the global license agreement with ReproNovo for leflutrozole in December 2023. 

Contractual Obligations 
 As further described in our 2023 Annual Report, under Item 1. Business Material Agreements Novartis Agreements (as updated in note 16 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report) and Item 1. Business Material Agreements Licensing Agreement with AstraZeneca, under various agreements with Novartis and AstraZeneca, we have agreed to make milestone payments and pay royalties on potential future commercial sales. The amount, timing, and likelihood of such payments are not known and will remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. 
 In addition, we enter into contracts in the ordinary course of business with CROs, CMOs, and other vendors to assist in the performance of its research and development activities and other services and products for operating purposes. The contracts with CROs generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts. We have manufacturing commitments with CMOs of 2.4 million as of September 30, 2024.

 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.4 million, an increase of 9.1 million from 14.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The most significant items driving this increase were: 
 (i) a one-time milestone payment of 9.0 million being received in the three months ended September 30, 2023 resulting from the achievement of a clinical milestone on setrusumab from Ultragenyx; 
 (ii) receipt of 1.8 million in research and development tax credits in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with no similar amounts received in the nine months ended September 30, 2024; 
 (iii) receipt of 1.7 million less from our depository to reimburse certain expenses incurred by us in respect of our ADR program in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 than the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and 
 (iv) approximately 0.6 million higher other net cash operating expenses. 
 These increases were partially offset by the receipt of 2.0 million from a claim on our Directors and Officers insurance policy to reimburse us for certain legal and professional costs incurred in prior years and 1.8 million higher net interest inflows. 
 27 

Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.7 million, an increase of 0.3 million from 0.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to additional payments to acquire intangible assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 46.2 million, an increase of 38.2 million from 8.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase represents the difference between the net proceeds received from the underwritten registered direct offering in June 2024 of 46.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the net proceeds of an at-the-market offering of 11.1 million, offset by 3.2 million paid to redeem the Private Placement loan notes in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating and Capital Expenditure Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 455.8 million. We expect to continue to report significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our research and development efforts and seek to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and any future product we develop. 
 We expect to continue to incur expenses in connection with our ongoing development activities related to our product candidates, our outsourced manufacturing activities and other associated costs including the management of our intellectual property portfolio. We also expect to continue to incur costs associated with operating as a U.S. public company listed on Nasdaq and as a domestic registrant. 
 These costs will increase further if we: 
 seek to develop additional product candidates; 

seek regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure and scale-up manufacturing capabilities to commercialize or co-commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval and chose to commercialize directly; 

expand our intellectual property portfolio; 

add further clinical, scientific, operational, financial, legal and management information systems, and personnel, including personnel to support our development and to support our operations as a U.S. public company listed on Nasdaq; or 

experience any delays or encounter any issues from any of the above, including but not limited to failed studies, complex results, safety issues, or other regulatory challenges. 

We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our currently committed clinical trials, operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2027. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates and any future product candidates and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of any of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the costs for our activities related to our ongoing collaboration with Ultragenyx for setrusumab for the treatment of adults and children with OI; and potential future clinical trials for alvelestat in AATD and other potential indications; 

the costs and timing of manufacturing clinical supplies of our product candidates; 

the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates, including post-marketing studies that could be required by regulatory authorities; 

28 

the costs, timing, and outcome of potential future commercialization activities, including manufacturing, marketing, sales, life cycle management and distribution, for our product candidates that we commercialize directly; 

the timing and amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates; 

the costs and timing of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications; maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights; and defending any intellectual property-related claims, including any claims by third parties that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights; 

the sales price and availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates; 

the effect of competitors and market developments; 

the performance of our collaborators and partners under the existing agreements on setrusumab, navicixizumab and, leflutrozole; 

the extent to which we are able to acquire new product candidates or enter into licensing or collaboration arrangements for our product candidates, although we currently have no commitments or agreements to complete any such transactions; 

milestone payments under our license and option agreement with AstraZeneca; 

whether we need to repay the principal and interest on our Convertible Loan Note with Novartis due in February 2025. We currently assume it will be converted or otherwise refinanced with new debt or equity; and 

tax liabilities or other assessments and our ability to claim R D tax credits or other reliefs. 

Our revenues, if any, will be derived from development milestones or sales of any product candidates that we are able to successfully develop, receive regulatory approval for, and commercialize in future years. In the meantime, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objective. 
 Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raised additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. 
 Any future debt financing or preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute your ownership interests. 
 To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, shareholders' ownership interests may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a shareholder. If we are unable to raise additional funds through partnerships, debt or equity financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our accounting estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe that there are no estimates and assumptions made in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that rise to this level. Our critical accounting policies are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting 
 29 

Estimates in our 2023 Annual Report, which was filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024. If actual results or events differ materially from the estimates, judgments and assumptions used by us in applying these policies, our reported financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates from those described in our 2023 Annual Report.
