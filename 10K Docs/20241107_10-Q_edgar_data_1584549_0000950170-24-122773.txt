The tax (provision) benefit in any period will be affected by, among other things, permanent, as well as discrete items, differences in the deductibility of certain items, changes in the valuation allowance related to net deferred tax assets, in addition to changes in tax legislation. As a result, the Company may experience significant fluctuations in the effective book tax rate (that is, tax expense divided by pre-tax book income) from period to period. In order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets, the Company will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years. The Company analyzed all positive and negative evidence to determine if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax assets. The recognition of the net deferred tax assets and related tax benefits is based upon the Company s conclusions regarding, among other considerations, estimates of future earnings based on information currently available and current and anticipated customers, contracts, and product introductions, as well as historical operating results and certain tax planning strategies. Based on the analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has concluded that it does not have the ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the necessary periods to utilize the entire benefit for its deferred tax assets. Accordingly, the Company established a valuati on allowance of as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023. The Company cannot presently estimate what, if any, changes to the valuation of its deferred tax assets may be deemed appropriate in the future.

We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties described in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our forward-looking statements contained in this report. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this management s discussion and analysis, and we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. 
 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 Village Farms International, Inc. VFF , together with its subsidiaries, the Company , Village Farms , we us or our is a corporation existing under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario). The Company s principal operating subsidiaries are Village Farms Canada Limited Partnership ("VFCLP"), Village Farms L.P. ("VFLP"), Pure Sunfarms Corp. Pure Sunfarms or "PSF"), Balanced Health Botanicals, LLC Balanced Health ), Rose LifeScience Inc. ("Rose LifeScience or Rose ), VF Clean Energy, Inc. VFCE ), and Leli Holland B. V. ("Leli" or "Leli Holland"). 
 The Company s vision is to be recognized as an international leader in consumer products developed from plants, whereby we produce and market value-added products that are consistently preferred by consumers. To do so, we leverage decades of cultivation expertise, investment, and experience in fresh produce into branded and wholesale cannabis products within markets with legally permissible opportunities. 
 In Canada, we converted two produce facilities to grow cannabis for the Canadian legal adult use (recreational) market. Our focus for our Canadian Cannabis segment is to produce high quality cannabis, leveraging our low-cost production to provide preferred products at an attractive price that address the preferred consumer segments in the market. This market positioning, combined with our cultivation expertise, has enabled us to evolve into the second best-selling producer nationally and one of the few Canadian licensed producers with consistently strong operating results. 
 Additionally, through organic growth, exports and/or acquisitions, we have a strategy to participate in other international markets where cannabis attains legal status. In September 2021, our Canadian Cannabis business began exporting cannabis products to Australia for that country s medical market. In March 2022, our Canadian Cannabis business received European Union Good Manufacturing Practice EU GMP certification for Pure Sunfarms 1.1 million square foot Delta 3 cannabis facility located in Delta, British Columbia B.C. which permits Pure Sunfarms to export EU GMP-certified medical cannabis to importers and distributors in international markets that require EU GMP certification. In late 2022, Pure Sunfarms commenced exports to Israel and in 2023, Pure Sunfarms began exporting cannabis products to Germany and the United Kingdom for the medical markets in those countries. As a result of the typically higher margins in international medical markets, we expect international expansion to enhance our profitability while expanding our brand and experience into emerging legal cannabis markets. Through our ownership of Leli Holland, we hold one of ten licenses to cultivate cannabis legally in the Netherlands under that country s Closed Supply Chain Experiment program, with cultivation beginning in October of 2024. 
 In the U.S., Balanced Health is our industry-leading cannabinoid business, extending our portfolio into cannabidiol CBD consumer products. 
 We also operate a large, well-established, produce business (primarily tomatoes) under the Village Farms Fresh VF Fresh brand which sells to food distribution companies and mass retail stores. We own and operate produce cultivation assets in Texas and Delta, B.C. and source produce from our growing partners, in Mexico and Canada. 
 Our intention is to use our assets, expertise and experience (across cannabis, CBD and produce) to participate in the U.S. Cannabis market subject to compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state laws and applicable stock exchange rules.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized earnings measure and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of the Company because it excludes non-recurring and other items that do not reflect our business performance. Adjusted EBITDA includes the Company s 70 interest in Rose LifeScience through March 31, 2024, 80 interest in Rose LifeScience beginning on April 1, 2024, 85 interest in Leli through September 22, 2024, and our 100 interest in Leli beginning on September 23, 2024. 

We caution that our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 may not be indicative of our future performance.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized earnings measure and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of the Company because it excludes non-recurring and other items that do not reflect our business performance. Adjusted EBITDA includes the Company s 70 interest in Rose LifeScience through March 31, 2024, 80 interest in Rose LifeScience beginning on April 1, 2024, 85 interest in Leli through September 22, 2024, and our 100 interest in Leli beginning on September 23, 2024. 

CANADIAN CANNABIS SEGMENT RESULTS

Beginning on April 1, 2024, our interest in Rose LifeScience increased from 70 to 80 , which is reflected in the results presented below.

 Sales

The increase of 7,653, or 27 , was due primarily to a 18 increase in net branded sales and a 66 increase in non-branded sales. The increase in net branded sales was due to market share gain across the flower, pre-roll and milled categories, driven by successful new product launches, the expansion of a rapidly growing brand, and rising demand for value-based product offerings. The increase in non-branded sales resulted from improved industry supply dynamics and pricing supported by a shift of many producers toward asset-light models and sales of non-brand-spec inventory. International sales increased by 94 primarily due to higher sales to Germany, the United Kingdom, and Australia.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 References in this Management s Discussion and Analysis to Adjusted EBITDA are to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA ), as further adjusted to exclude foreign currency exchange gains and losses, share-based compensation, gains and losses on asset sales and the other adjustments set forth in the table below. In addition, we present below Adjusted EBITDA Constant Currency which excludes the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. See Constant Currency below. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA - Constant Currency are measures of operating performance that are not recognized under GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that our non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our performance. Our non-GAAP measures are used as additional measures to evaluate the operating and financial performance of our segments. Management believes that our non-GAAP measures are important measures in evaluating the historical performance of the Company because it excludes non-recurring and other items that do not reflect our business performance.

(1) Reflects impairment to goodwill and intangibles of 11,939 in U.S. Cannabis that was based on recent historical performance, near-term forecasts, and the state of the CBD industry in the United States. See Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments below for more information . 

(2) Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized earnings measure and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA presented for these segments may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of the Company because it excludes non-recurring and other items that do not reflect the underlying business performance of the Company. 

Adjusted EBITDA Constant Currency 
 To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have presented constant currency adjusted financial measures for sales, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative, other income (expense), operating (loss) income, loss from consolidated entities, net loss, and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying operations performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and comparative prior period income statement results in currencies other than U.S. dollars are converted into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates from the three and nine month comparative periods in 2023 rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the respective current periods. All growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in 2023. We have provided this non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding the performance of our segments without taking into account the effect of exchange rate fluctuations. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Quarterly Report should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 The tables below set forth certain measures of consolidated results from continuing operations on a constant currency basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 on an as reported and constant currency basis (in thousands):

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
 No accounting pronouncements recently issued or newly effective have had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are included in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 
 As described in Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements included in Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing for impairment indicators for the Company s U.S. and Canadian Cannabis segments. As part of this assessment, the Company considered both external and internal factors, including overall financial performance and outlook. 
 Cannabis - U.S. 
 At June 30, 2024, when the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing impairment indicators it concluded that the Company's U.S. - Cannabis segment more likely than not was impaired. The Company reviewed the reporting segment's assets, including goodwill and intangible assets. Based on recent historical performance during the quarter which underperformed relative to budget, a revised June 30, 2024 forecast which resulted in a shortfall compared to the March 31, 2024 forecast, the new restrictions on CBD sales in an additional eight states at July 1, 2024, and the proliferation of unregulated hemp-derived products on the market which continues to challenge market share for the CBD industry, the Company concluded that as of June 30, 2024, the fair value of the brand intangible asset and goodwill was fully impaired and an impairment charge to intangibles of 1,900 and goodwill of 10,039 was recorded to the U.S. Cannabis reporting unit. 
 Cannabis - U.S. - Goodwill 
 At June 30, 2024, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a discounted cash flow projection using projections for 2024 to 2028 with an average revenue growth rate of 6 between 2025 to 2028, followed by a terminal growth rate of 2 . 
 33 

Management concluded that as of June 30, 2024, the fair value was lower than its carrying amount and as a result, an impairment charge to goodwill of 10,039 was recorded to the reporting unit. 
 The significant assumptions applied to the determination of the fair value are described below: 
 Post-tax discount rate: A market participant post-tax discount rate applied to the after-tax forecast cash flows was 12 . A decrease of 1 to the discount rate, would not result in material change to the impairment charge. 
 Terminal growth rate: An increase of 1 in the terminal growth rate would not result in a material change to the impairment charge. 
 Future cash flows: An increase in future cash flows by 10 would not result in a material change to the impairment charge. 
 Cannabis U.S. Brand 
 The fair value of the brand was determined based on a discounted cash flow projection. Specifically, the Company utilized a relief from royalty valuation technique to arrive at the fair value of the brand. Management concluded that as of June 30, 2024, the fair value was lower than its carrying value of 1,900 as the notional brand maintenance costs exceeded the incremental royalty of 3.5 . Therefore, an impairment charge to the brand intangible of 1,900 was allocated to the reporting unit. 
 Cannabis - Canada 
 At September 30, 2024, when the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing impairment indicators for Canadian Cannabis it concluded that no impairment indicators existed as no events or circumstances occurred that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting units to be below their carrying amounts. 
 At September 30, 2023, the Company concluded that no impairment indicators existed as no events or circumstances occurred that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting units to be below their carrying amounts. 
 We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying our critical accounting policies. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, our variable interest rate debt was primarily related to our Credit Facilities and Term Loans. Outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility and Term Loans bear interest at either the (a) Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or (b) Canadian Prime Rate, as defined in the agreement, plus an applicable margin. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 4,000 aggregate principal amount of outstanding revolving loans under our Operating Loan with an interest rate of 7.8 and we had approximately 43,253 in aggregate principal amounts of our Term Loans with a weighted average interest rate of 8.8 . The current interest rates for outstanding revolving loans under our Credit Facility and Term Loans reflect basis point increases of approximately 0.9 over the comparable period in 2023. 
 Our interest expense is affected by the overall interest rate environment. Our variable rate interest debt subjects us to risk from increases in prevailing interest rates. This risk increases in the current inflationary environment, in which the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates, resulting in an increase in our variable interest rates and related interest expense. An additional 50 basis point increase in the applicable interest rates under our Credit Facility and Term Loan would have increased our interest expense by approximately 57 and 171 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 65 and 131 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 While we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the significance of the impact that interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, management evaluates our financial position on an ongoing basis. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Canadian/U.S. foreign exchange rate was C 1.00 = US 0.7398 and C 1.00 = US 0.7363, respectively. If all other variables remain constant, an increase of 0.10 in the Canadian dollar would have the following impact on the ending balances of certain statements of financial position items at September 30, 2024 and 2023 with the net foreign exchange gain or loss directly impacting net income (loss):

(4,201) 

Our exposure to foreign exchange risk and the impact of foreign exchange rates are monitored by the Company s management but generally the Company tries to match its sales (trade receivables) and vendor payments (trade payables) such that the net impact is not material. 
 Other than the interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk discussed above, there have been no material changes to our market risks from those disclosed in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective at a reasonable assurance level due to the material weakness described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
 35 

year ended December 31, 2023, which has not been fully remediated as of September 30, 2024, as well as the following material weakness identified during the quarter ended September 30, 2024: 
 We identified a material weakness in our risk assessment component of internal control over financial reporting that resulted in a failure to effectively design and implement sufficient internal controls related to our information technology general controls ITGCs in the areas of user access and program change-management over the information technology IT system that is utilized to support the Produce segment s financial reporting processes. Specifically, under our existing ITGCs, we determined that there were insufficient controls to limit user access to this system and to enable oversight of changes being made to the financial inputs under this system. As a result, business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on and use information produced from the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted by any inappropriate user access or financial input changes. 	Notwithstanding the identification of the foregoing material weakness, we are not aware of any such inappropriate user access or financial input changes. Accordingly, this material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to our financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. 
 Remediation Plan and Status 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued to implement a remediation plan to improve the operation of its controls over the review of the determination of the fair value of its goodwill and intangible assets, as previously described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,2023. Management is also in the process of designing controls to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the ITCG material weakness described above are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented and operating effectively. These remediation actions are ongoing and included or are expected to include: 
 Enhancing risk assessment and control identification procedures for our Produce segment s system environment; 

Enhancing existing controls and/or applying other appropriate procedures to address the design and operation of IT general controls within our Produce segment s system environment in order to, among other things, limit user access; and 

Implementing monitoring controls around timely identification and review of system changes. 

As we continue to evaluate and enhance our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine that additional measures to address the material weaknesses or adjustments to the remediation plan may be required. Once controls are designed and implemented, the controls must be operating effectively for a sufficient period of time and be tested by management in order to consider them remediated and conclude that the design is effective to address the risks of material misstatement. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, has reviewed the Company s internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act), other than continuing to address the material weaknesses described above, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
