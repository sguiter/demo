Among other things, forward looking statements made in the Original Report have not been revised to reflect events that occurred or facts that became known to the Company after the filing of the Original Report, and such forward looking statements should be read in their historical context.

 million one-time cash payment (the Payment ), which was received in April 2023. At the time of cancellation, no product units had been delivered under the Cancelled PO s and the Company had two other purchase orders from the same customer for the same product Open PO s ). The Company originally accounted for the Cancelled PO s as a single contract and recognized the million payment as component of product revenue in the first quarter of 2023. Subsequent to the issuance of the Original Report, the Company reassessed the accounting treatment of the Payment and concluded that the Cancelled PO s and Open PO s represented a combined contract such that the February 2023 transaction should have been analyzed and accounted for as a contract modification, which required the Payment to be deferred and recognized as product units were delivered under the Open PO s. All Open PO product units were fully delivered to the customer by June 30, 2024. The correction of the Misstatement affects certain financial statement line items in these condensed consolidated financial statements including but not limited to product revenues, income tax provision, foreign currency translation, deferred revenues, prepaid expenses, deferred taxes and earnings-per-share. Consolidated Financial Statements - Restatement Reconciliation Tables The following tables present the impact of the financial statement adjustments on the Company's previously reported condensed consolidated financial statements. The "Previously Reported" amounts in the following tables are amounts derived from the Original Report. The amounts in the columns labeled "Revenue Adjustments" represent the effect of adjustments resulting from the correction of the overstatement of revenues associated with the Payment and related tax impact. The amounts in the columns labeled "Other Adjustments" represent the effect of other adjustments that relate to other unrelated errors in previously filed financial statements that were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to those filed financial statements. The effects of both the restatement for the Revenue Adjustments and the immaterial Other Adjustments have been corrected in all impacted tables and footnotes throughout these condensed consolidated financial statements.

million and million, respectively, in money market accounts. These funds are valued on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs. Contingent Consideration Earnouts As of June 30, 2024 , the maximum amount of future contingent consideration (undiscounted) that we could be required to pay in connection with completed acquisitions is: million over a three-year earnout period for Avitide, Inc. Avitide ), which was acquired in September 2021 and for which the earnout periods run from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024; million over a two-year earnout period for FlexBiosys, Inc. FlexBiosys ), which was acquired in April 2023 and for which the earnout periods run from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024; and approximately million over a one-year earnout period for Metenova Holding AB Metenova ), which was acquired in October 2023 and for which the earnout period runs from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. See Note 4, Acquisitions to this report for additional information on the contingent consideration earnouts. Since the date of acquisition, expected results and changes in market inputs used to calculate the discount rate related to Avitide, FlexBiosys and Metenova, have, at times, resulted in changes in amounts reported as the Company s contingent consideration obligation. As of June 30, 2024, management assessed the remaining contingent consideration obligation balances and the existing market inputs used and decided that no changes in fair value were required.

Severance and employee-related costs under the Restructuring Plan are primarily associated with actual headcount reductions. Costs incurred include cash severance and non-cash severance, including other termination benefits. Severance and other termination benefit packages are based on established benefit arrangements or local statutory requirements and we recognized the contractual component of these benefits when payment was probable and could be reasonably estimated. Non-cash charges for accelerated depreciation were recognized on long-lived assets that were taken out of service before the end of their normal service due to the shutdown of manufacturing facilities and production lines, in which case depreciation estimates were revised to reflect the use of the assets over their shortened useful life. The restructuring accrual is included in accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2024 and the balance is expected to be paid by the third quarter of 2024.

When disaggregating revenue, the Company considered all of the economic factors that may affect its revenues. Because its revenues are from bioprocessing customers, there are no differences in the nature, timing and uncertainty of the Company s revenues and cash flows from any of its product lines. However, given that the Company s revenues are generated in different geographic regions, factors such as regulatory, economic and geopolitical developments within those regions could impact the nature, timing and uncertainty of the Company s revenues and cash flows. Disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by geographic region and revenue from significant customers can be found in Note 15, Segment Reporting, included in this report.

1.00 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 On December 14, 2023, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of its 2023 Notes in the Exchange and Subscription Agreements with a limited number of holders of its outstanding 2019 Notes and certain other qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Pursuant to the Exchange and Subscription Agreements and to the Exchange Transaction, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes in a private placement to accredited institutional buyers (the Subscription Transactions for million in cash. The Company evaluated the Exchange Transaction and determined approximately million of the million principal of the exchanged 2019 Notes should be accounted for as extinguishments of debt and approximately million should be accounted for as modification of debt. As a result, the Company recognized a million loss on extinguishments of debt in its consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023, inclusive of million of unamortized debt issuance costs. Under debt modification accounting, the carrying amount of the modified 2019 Notes was reduced by million, with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital, to account for the increase in the fair value of the embedded conversion option, representing a debt discount of the modified 2019 Notes. The aggregate debt discount of million as of June 30, 2024, comprised of million increase in principal of the modified 2019 Notes and a million increase in the fair value of the embedded conversion option. The aggregate debt discount of million as of December 31, 2023, comprised of million increase in principal of the modified 2019 Notes and a million increase in the fair value of the embedded conversion option. These amounts are presented as a direct reduction from the carrying value of the convertible debt in their respective periods presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. This amount is being accreted into interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) using the effective interest method over the term of the 2023 Notes. Proceeds from the Subscription Transactions were million, net of debt issuance costs of million. The Exchange Transaction resulted in million of the debt issuance costs related to the modified 2019 Notes, which were expensed as incurred in accordance with debt modification accounting, and million of deferred debt issuance costs related to the 2023 Notes, which were recorded as a direct deduction to the carrying value of the 2023 Notes on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company is amortizing the million of debt issuance costs of the 2023 Notes into amortization of debt issuance costs in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) over the remaining term of the 2023 Notes. The carrying value of the 2023 Notes of million and million is included in long-term debt on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company used million of the proceeds from the Subscription Transactions to repurchase shares of its common stock from certain purchasers of the 2023 Notes. For more information regarding this repurchase, see Note 13, Stockholders Equity - Share Repurchases included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, to the Company's Form 10-K/A. The Company will also use a portion of the proceeds to finance in part, the settlement upon conversion or repurchase of the remaining 2019 Notes at maturity. See Note 16, Subsequent Events - Maturity of the Remaining 2019 Notes below for more information on the redemption of the 2019 Notes. The remainder of the proceeds will be used for working capital. The 2023 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and bear interest at a rate of per year. . The 2023 Notes will mature on , unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. During the second quarter of 2024, the closing price of the Company s common stock did not exceed of the conversion price of the 2023 Notes for more than trading days of the last consecutive trading of the quarter. As a result, the 2023 Notes are not convertible at the option of the holders of the 2023 Notes during the third quarter of 2024, the quarter immediately following the quarter when the conditions are met, as

million as noncurrent liabilities on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2024. The initial conversion rate for the 2023 Notes is shares of the Company s common stock per principal amount of 2023 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share and represents a premium over the last reported sale price of per share on December 6, 2023, the date on which the 2023 Notes were priced. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2028, the 2023 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders of 2023 Notes only upon the satisfaction of the specified conditions mentioned above and during certain quarters commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2024, into cash up to their principal amount, and into cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company s election, for the conversion value above the principal amount, if any. Thereafter until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the 2023 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders of 2023 Notes at any time regardless of these conditions. The Company may redeem for cash, all or a portion of the 2023 Notes, at its option, on or after December 18, 2026 and prior to the 21 st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the redemption date, if certain conditions are met in accordance to the 2023 Notes Indenture.

Immediately following the closing of the Exchange Transaction mentioned above, million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes remained outstanding as of December 31, 2023. As of June 30, 2024, subsequent to the conversion of another million, million in aggregate principal amount remains outstanding.

The initial conversion rate for the 2019 Notes is shares of the Company s common stock per principal amount of 2019 Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share). The 2019 Notes are convertible as of June 30, 2024 at the option of the holders at any time regardless of prior conditions that were in place and were convertible until the close of business on July 11, 2024, the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The 2019 Notes are not redeemable by the Company prior to maturity. See Note 16, Subsequent Event - Maturity of the Remaining 2019 Notes below for more information on the July 15, 2024 maturity. As of the date of this filing, excluding the Exchange Transaction mentioned above, the Company has received requests to convert million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and all have been settled as of June 30, 2024.

At June 30, 2024, shares were available for future grants under the 2018 Plan. Chief Executive Officer Accounting Modifications (As Restated) On June 12, 2024, upon approval by the Board, the Company entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the Transition Agreement with the Company's Chief Executive Officer CEO ), Tony J. Hunt, which amends and restates Mr. Hunt's Third Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with the Company dated as of May 26, 2022. Under the terms of the Transition Agreement, Mr. Hunt will relinquish his position as the Company's CEO effective September 1, 2024 (the Transition Date and will transition to a new role as Executive Chair of the Board beginning on the Transition Date (the CEO Transition ). It is anticipated that Mr. Hunt will continue to be involved in the business as the Executive Chair of the Board until March 2026 and will continue to be employed by the Company as an advisor thereafter, until March 2027. Under the terms of the Transition Agreement and the award agreements governing Mr. Hunt s outstanding equity awards, Mr. Hunt s unvested stock awards will continue to vest in accordance with their original terms. Furthermore, on June 28, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment (the 2024 Award Amendment to the equity awards granted to Mr. Hunt in 2024, which consisted of a stock option, restricted stock units RSUs and performance stock units PSUs and together the 2024 Grants ). Pursuant to the terms of the 2024 Award Amendment, two-thirds of the 2024 Grants were forfeited, which equates to shares of the Company s common stock. Although Mr. Hunt s unvested equity awards continue to vest in accordance with their original terms and there has been no amendment to Mr. Hunt s outstanding equity awards other than the 2024 Award Amendment, the Company determined that under ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation , the CEO Transition represents a significant reduction in Mr. Hunt s operating role with the Company for accounting purposes. This determination resulted in a Type III accounting modification of certain of Mr. Hunt s unvested stock awards (improbable to probable) under ASC 718 (the Equity Modification on June 12, 2024. As a result, for accounting purposes only, Mr. Hunt s unvested awards were deemed cancelled and a new grant issued for his unvested shares with the value of these awards recalculated using a price of per share, which was the opening stock price of the first day of trading following the public announcement of the CEO Transition.

million over the remaining requisite service period, which the Company determined to be between June 13, 2024 and September 1, 2024 and represents the remaining service period of Mr. Hunt s role as CEO. The Company determined that the PSUs granted to Mr. Hunt in 2022 and 2023 should be accounted for as a Type IV accounting modification (improbable to improbable) in accordance with ASC 718, because vesting conditions before and after June 12, 2024 were improbable of being achieved. As a result of the Equity Modification and the forfeiture of the pro-rata portion of Mr. Hunt s 2024 Grants, the Company recognized million of incremental stock-based compensation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. Stock Issued for Earnout Payments In April 2024, the Company issued shares of its common stock to former securityholders of Avitide to satisfy the contingent consideration obligation established under the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the Avitide Agreement which the Company entered into as part of the acquisition of Avitide in September 2021. In March 2024, the Company issued shares of its common stock to former securityholders of FlexBiosys to satisfy the contingent consideration obligation established under the FlexBiosys Agreement, which the Company entered into as part of the acquisition of FlexBiosys in April 2023. See Note 5, Acquisitions , included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, to the Company s Form 10-K/A for additional information on the acquisitions of Avitide and FlexBiosys and the contingent consideration.

Legal Proceedings From time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probably that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial results.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, sh ares and shares, respectively, of the Company s common stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of the stock options were greater than or equal to the average price of the common shares and were therefore anti-dilutive. Comparatively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 , shares and shares, respectively, were considered anti-dilutive. In July 2019, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of its 2019 Notes. As provided by the terms of the Second Supplemental Indenture underlying the 2019 Notes, upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, the Company will use a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, settling the par value of the 2019 Notes in cash and any excess conversion premium in shares. On December 14, 2023, the Company exchanged, in a privately negotiated exchange, million principal amount of 2023 Notes for million principal amount of 2019 Notes and issued million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes for million in cash. Immediately following the closing of the Exchange Transaction mentioned above, million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes remained outstanding as of December 31, 2023 with terms unchanged. As of June 30, 2024, subsequent to the conversion of another million, million in aggregate principal amount remains outstanding. As mentioned above and as provided by the terms of the Second Supplemental Indenture underlying the 2019 Notes, the Company irrevocably elected to settle the conversion obligation for the 2019 Notes in a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock. This means the Company will settle the par value of the 2019 Notes in cash and any excess conversion premium in shares. The Company is required to reflect the dilutive effect of the convertible securities by application of the if-converted method, which means the denominator of the EPS calculation would include the total number of shares assuming the 2019 Notes had been fully converted at the beginning of the period. Accordingly, the par value of the 2019 Notes was not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, but the dilutive effect of the conversion premium was considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share using the treasury stock method. The dilutive impact of the 2019 Notes was based on the difference between the Company s current period average stock price and the conversion price of the 2019 Notes, provided there was a premium. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the dilutive effect of the conversion premium included in the calculation of diluted earnings was shares and shares, respectively.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers (As Restated) Financial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Per the Company s investment policy, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in financial instruments with high credit ratings, and credit exposure to any one issue, issuer (with the exception of U.S. Treasury obligations) and type of instrument is limited. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no investments associated with foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to customers to whom the Company makes significant sales. While a reserve for the potential write-off of accounts receivable is maintained, the Company has not written off any significant accounts to date. To control credit risk, the Company performs regular credit evaluations of its customers financial condition. There was revenue from customers that represented or more of the Company's total revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Significant accounts receivable balances representing or more of the Company s total trade accounts receivable balances at June 30, 2024 came from our accounts receivable balance outstanding with Novo Nordisk A/S, which was of the Company s total trade accounts receivable balance.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Overview 
 Repligen and its subsidiaries, collectively doing business as Repligen Corporation Repligen , we , our , or the Company is a global life sciences company that develops and commercializes highly innovative bioprocessing technologies and systems that increase efficiencies and flexibility in the process of manufacturing biological drugs. 
 As the overall market for biologics continues to grow and expand, our customers primarily large biopharmaceutical companies and contract development and manufacturing organizations and other life sciences companies (integrators) face critical production cost, capacity, quality and time pressures. Built to address these concerns, our products help set new standards for the way biologics are manufactured. We are committed to inspiring advances in bioprocessing as a trusted partner in the production of critical biologic drugs including monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, vaccines and cell and gene therapies that are improving human health worldwide. Increasingly, our technologies are being implemented to overcome challenges in processing plasmid DNA (a starting material for the production of mRNA) and gene delivery vectors such as lentivirus and adeno-associated viral vectors. For more information regarding our business, products and acquisitions, see Part I, Item 1, Business , included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on November 18, 2024 Form 10-K/A ). 
 We currently operate as one bioprocessing business, with a comprehensive suite of products to serve both upstream and downstream processes in biological drug manufacturing. Building on over 40 years of industry expertise, we have developed a broad and diversified product portfolio that reflects our passion for innovation and the customer-first culture that drives our entire organization. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to maximize the value of our product platform through both organic growth initiatives (internal innovation and leveraging commercial opportunities) and targeted acquisitions. 
 Restatement 
 As previously described in the Explanatory Note above and in Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we have restated our previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes as of June 30, 2024 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. As a result, the previously reported financial information as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 in this Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been updated to reflect the relevant restatement. Refer to Note 1 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the restatement, including descriptions of the adjustments and the impacts on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Other than the effect of the restatement as described in Note 1 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, this section has not been otherwise modified and does not reflect any information or events occurring after July 30, 2024, the filing date of the Original Report, or modify or update those disclosures affected by events that occurred at a later date or facts that subsequently became known to the Company, except to the extent they are otherwise required to be included and discussed herein. 
 Macroeconomic Trends 
 As a result of our global presence, a significant portion of our revenue and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are therefore subject to non-U.S. exchange exposure. Exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening or strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could increase or reduce our revenue and gross profit margin and impact the comparability of results from period to period. 
 We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cost inflation, primarily in raw materials, and other supply chain costs, as a result of global macroeconomic trends, including global geopolitical conflicts and labor shortages. Actions taken to mitigate supply chain disruptions and inflation, including price increases and productivity improvements, have generally been successful in offsetting the impact of these trends. In addition, decreasing demand for vaccines for the COVID-19 pandemic, 
 33 

including all subsequent variants of the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus is driving a reduction in future demand of our products related to these vaccines. 
 2024 Acquisition 
 Pending Acquisition of Tantti Laboratory Inc. 
 On July 29, 2024, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Tantti Laboratory Inc. Tantti ). Tantti, which is headquartered in Taoyuan City, Taiwan, is expected to accelerate our expansion into new modality markets with unique, scalable purification solutions for large molecule biologics. 
 We expect the acquisition of Tantti to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including clearance through the Taiwanese regulatory channel. 
 2023 Acquisitions 
 Acquisition of FlexBiosys, Inc. 
 On April 17, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests in FlexBiosys, Inc. FlexBiosys ), pursuant to an Equity Purchase Agreement with FlexBiosys, TSAP Holdings Inc. NJ Seller ), Gayle Tarry and Stanley Tarry, as individuals (collectively with NJ Seller, the Sellers ), and Stanley Tarry, in his capacity as the representative of the Sellers (the FlexBiosys Acquisition ). 
 FlexBiosys, which is headquartered in Branchburg, New Jersey, offers expert design and custom manufacturing of single-use bioprocessing products and a comprehensive range of products that include bioprocessing bags, bottles, and tubing assemblies. These products will complement and expand our fluid management portfolio of offerings. 
 Acquisition of Metenova Holding AB 
 On October 2, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests in Metenova Holding AB Metenova ), pursuant to a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement with, inter alia, Metenova for approximately 173 million in cash and the Company's equity. Metenova will further strengthen our fluid management portfolio with its magnetic mixing and drive train technologies that are widely used by global biopharmaceutical companies and contract development and manufacturing organizations. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 A critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For a description of our critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our significant accounting policies in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K/A. 
 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes thereto.

Product revenues (As Restated) 
 We focus on selling our products directly to customers in the pharmaceutical industry and to our contract manufacturers. These direct sales represented approximately 88.8 and 84.7 of our product revenue for each of the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and represented 89.6 and 83.6 of our product revenue for each of the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Sales of our bioprocessing products can be impacted by the timing of large-scale production orders and the regulatory approvals for such antibodies, which may result in significant quarterly fluctuations. 
 During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, product revenue decreased by 0.3 million, or 0.2 , and 12.5 million, or 3.9 , respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023. The decrease between the three and six-month periods is mainly due to a decrease in revenue from our proteins franchise due to weak demand, which reflects the Cytiva (a standalone operating company owned by Danaher Corporation) drop-off since they are producing product in-house and lower forecast for ligands from other customers. The decrease in revenue during the six-month periods also included a decrease in revenue from programs related to the COVID-19 pandemic as customers inventory has reduced at a slower pace than initially expected, which has primarily affected revenue from sales of our filtration products. Partially offsetting the decrease in revenue for the three and six month periods is an increase in revenue from the operations of acquisitions completed subsequent to the prior year comparable periods. In addition, the performance of our Alternating Tangential Filtration business, a part of our filtration franchise, was strong in the second quarter of 2024 as well as the first half of 2024 resulting in an increase in revenue during the three and six months ending June 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods of 2023. Revenue from sales by the remaining franchises for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 remained relatively in line with similar revenue from the same periods of 2023. 
 Royalty and other revenues 
 Royalty and other revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 relate to royalties received from a third-party systems manufacturer associated with our OPUS chromatography columns. Royalty revenues are variable and are dependent on sales generated by our partners. 
 Costs of goods sold and operating expenses 
 Total costs and operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were comprised of the following:

Cost of goods sold (As Restated) 
 Cost of goods sold decreased 2.0 million, or 2.5 , and 7.4 million, or 4.6 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with lower revenue as well as a decrease in employee-related costs resulting from a decline in manufacturing headcount since June 30, 2023. Partially offsetting this was an increase in cost of goods sold that relates to the results of operations of FlexBiosys and Metenova, which have been in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition dates in April 2023 and October 2023, respectively. There was also an increase in cost of goods sold during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods of 2023 due to 0.5 million and 1.1 million, respectively, of costs incurred in 2024 from restructuring activities, for which there were no comparable costs in the same periods of 2023. 
 Gross margin was 51.3 and 50.2 in the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and gross margin was 50.7 and 50.3 in the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Lower margins were a result of lower overall sales and production volumes, and a change in product mix, where we saw a significant decline in revenue associated with higher-margin consumable products due to the decrease in COVID-19 vaccine demand. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development R D expenses are related to bioprocessing products, which include personnel, supplies and other research expenses. Due to the fact that these various programs share personnel and fixed costs, we do not track all of our expenses or allocate any fixed costs by program, and therefore, have not provided historical costs incurred by project. 
 R D expenses increased 0.9 million, or 9.0 , during the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. The increase is primarily due to an adjustment to decrease the bonus accrual recorded during the second quarter of 2023 for which there is no comparable amount recorded in the same period of 2024. The increase is also attributable to the operations of Metenova, which have been in our results of operations since the acquisition date in October 2023 and 0.3 million of costs from restructuring activities during the three months ended June 30, 2024, for which there were no comparable costs in the same period of 2023. Offsetting these increases were decreases in employee-related costs from a decrease in headcount since June 30, 2023 and a decrease in spending on new product development during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 R D expenses remained relatively consistent for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023 as the decreases in employee-related costs from lower R D headcount as well as decreased spending on new product development during the first half of 2024, compared to the first half of 2023, were almost fully offset by the increase in R D expenses that relate to the results of operations of FlexBiosys and Metenova. These results of operations have been in the consolidated results of operations since the acquisition dates in April 2023 and October 2023, respectively. There were also 0.4 million of costs from restructuring activities incurred by the Company during 2024, for which there were no comparable costs in the same period of 2023 and an adjustment to bring the corporate bonus accrual down recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2023, for which there were no comparable adjustment in the same period of 2024. 
 R D expense also includes payments made to expand our proteins product offering through our agreement with Navigo Proteins GmbH Navigo ). Such expenses were 0.9 million and 1.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 1.2 million and 2.3 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023, in the form of milestone payments to Navigo. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses (As Restated) 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses include the costs associated with selling our commercial products and costs required to support our marketing efforts, including legal, accounting, patent, shareholder services, amortization of intangible assets and other administrative functions. 
 SG A costs increased by 16.4 million, or 33.4 during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and increased 21.9 million, or 20.8 during the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods of 2023. The increase in SG A costs partially relate to the results of operations of FlexBiosys and Metenova, which have been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition dates in April 2023 and October 2023, respectively. SG A expenses also increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023 due to increases in employee-related costs, stock-based compensation, professional services and amortization. In addition, there were 0.2 million and 0.9 million in costs incurred from restructuring activities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, for which there were no 
 36 

comparable costs in the same periods of 2023. The increase in employee-related costs during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023 was due to an increase in SG A headcount since June 30, 2023. Also included in this increase was the impact of an adjustment recorded during the second quarter of 2023 to decrease the bonus accrual, resulting in an increase to the expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023. In addition, the increase in employee-related costs for the six month period was also a result of our annual merit increase in salaries which occurred in the first quarter of 2024. During the second quarter of 2024, we recorded the incremental stock compensation expense of 5.0 million associated with the modification of our Chief Executive Officer s CEO unvested equity awards resulting from the announcement of his transition from CEO to Executive Chair of our Board, which was announced on June 12, 2024 and effective September 1, 2024. For more information on the CEO s transition to Executive Chair of our Board. See Note 10, Stockholders Equity - Chief Executive Officer Accounting Modifications included in this report. Professional fees increased primarily due to added legal services during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Contingent consideration 
 Contingent consideration expense represents the change in fair value of the contingent consideration obligation included in current and noncurrent contingent consideration on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of the end of each period. Remeasurement of the contingent consideration obligation is done each quarter and the carrying value of the obligation is adjusted to the current fair value through our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Expected results and a change in market inputs used to calculate the discount rate, resulted in a change reported for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 of 1.8 million and 3.0 million, respectively. No adjustment was recorded for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 as management s assessment was that the balances of the contingent consideration obligations already represented fair value.

Investment income 
 Investment income includes income earned on invested cash balances. Our investment income increased by 3.4 million and 7.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods of 2023 due to an increase in interest rates on higher average invested cash balances since June 30, 2023. Offsetting this increase was a decrease in interest earned in 2023 on U.S. treasury bills purchased at the end of 2022, for which there was no comparable amount recorded in 2024. We expect investment income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 is primarily from contractual coupon interest on the convertible debt outstanding as of June 30, 2024. On December 14, 2023, we entered into a privately negotiated exchange and subscription agreement with certain holders of our 0.375 Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2019 Notes and certain new investors pursuant to which we issued 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the 2023 Notes ). Interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was 0.1 million of interest on the 2019 Notes for each period, compared to 0.3 million and 0.5 million, respectively of interest expense on the 2019 Notes in the same periods of 2023. Interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 also includes 1.5 million and 3.0 million, respectively, of contractual coupon interest on the 2023 Notes as well as 3.4 million and 6.7 million, respectively, in accretion of the 82.1 million debt discount on the modified notes, which includes the accretion of an increase in principal and the accretion of increased 
 37 

fair value of the conversion option for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, for which there were no comparable costs in the same periods of 2023. See Note 9, Convertible Senior Notes, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on this transaction. 
 Amortization of debt issuance costs 
 Transaction costs related to the issuance of the 2019 Notes and the 2023 Notes are amortized to amortization of debt issuance costs on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, amortization of debt issuance costs included 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively, of amortization of costs related to the 2019 Notes and 0.4 million and 0.8 million, respectively, of amortization of costs related to the 2023 Notes, compared to 0.5 million and 0.9 million, respectively, of amortization related to the 2019 Notes recorded in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. 
 Other (expenses) income 
 The change in other (expenses) income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023, is primarily attributable to realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses related to transactions with customers and vendors, as well as the revaluation impact of intercompany loans with subsidiaries. 
 Income tax provision (As Restated) 
 Income tax provision for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax provision of 3.3 million and 3.7 million, respectively. The effective tax rate was 36.7 and 29.2 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and is based upon the estimated income for the year ending December 31, 2024 and the composition of income in different jurisdictions. The difference in effective tax rates between the periods was primarily due to lower income before income taxes and nondeductible stock compensation, partially offset by stock windfall tax benefits. Our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 were higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to nondeductible stock compensation partially offset by stock windfall tax benefits. 
 For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded an income tax provision of 5.1 million and 8.3 million, respectively. The effective tax rate was 20.6 and 19.2 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and is based upon the estimated income for the year ending December 31, 2023 and the composition of income in different jurisdictions. The difference in effective tax rates between the periods was primarily due to lower income before income taxes and increased benefits from business tax credits partially offset by nondeductible contingent consideration and lower foreign-derived intangible income. Our effective tax rates for three and six months ended June 30, 2023 were lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to business tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income and stock windfall tax benefits recognized on stock option exercises and the vesting of stock units. 
 In 2021, the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Sharing with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15 . We continue to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. While various countries have implemented the legislation as of January 1, 2024, we do not expect a resulting material impact to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. 
 38 

Liquidity and Capital Resources (As Restated) 
 We have financed our operations primarily through revenues derived from product sales, the issuance of the 2019 Notes in July 2019, the 2023 Notes in December 2023 and the issuance of common stock in our December 2020, July 2019 and May 2019 public offerings. Our revenue for the foreseeable future will primarily be limited to our bioprocessing product revenue. 
 On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank SVB was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the FDIC as receiver. Subsequently, the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC announced that SVB depositors would have access to all of their money. We have a banking relationship with SVB and hold cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 0.2 million as of June 30, 2024 in SVB depository accounts to cover short-term operational payments. While we have not experienced any losses in such accounts, the failure of SVB in 2023 caused us to utilize our accounts at other financial institutions in order to mitigate potential operational risks stemming from the temporary inability to access funds in our SVB operating accounts. As a result of bank failures, such as SVB, our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired and could negatively impact the financial institutions with which we have direct arrangements, or the financial services industry or economy in general. 
 At June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 809.1 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of 751.3 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Working capital increased by 35.6 million to 982.0 million at June 30, 2024 from 946.4 million at December 31, 2023 due to the various changes noted below. 
 On December 14, 2023, the Company issued 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2023 Notes in a private placement pursuant to separate, privately negotiated exchange and subscription agreements (the Exchange and Subscription Agreements with a limited number of holders of its outstanding 2019 Notes and certain other qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended Securities Act ). Pursuant to the Exchange and Subscription Agreements, the Company exchanged 217.7 million of its 2019 Notes for 309.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes (the Exchange Transaction and issued 290.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes (the Subscription Transactions for 290.1 million in cash. Proceeds from the Subscription Transactions amounted to 276.1 million after debt issuance costs of 13.9 million. The 2023 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and bear interest at a rate of 1.00 per year. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15, commencing on June 15, 2024. The 2023 Notes will mature on December 15, 2028, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. During the first quarter of 2024, the closing price of the Company's common stock did not exceed 130 of the conversion price of the 2023 Notes for more than 20 trading days of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter. As a result, the 2023 Notes are not convertible at the option of the holders of the 2023 Notes during the third quarter of 2024, the quarter immediately following the quarter when the conditions are met, as stated in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes. For more information on the 2023 Notes, see Note 9, "Convertible Senior Notes," to this report. 
 The remaining 2019 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders as of June 30, 2024 at any time regardless of prior conditions that were in place and will be convertible until the close of business on July 11, 2024, the second trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2019 Notes during the second quarter of 2024, the quarter immediately following the quarter when the conditions are met, as stated in the terms of the 2019 Notes. As of the date of this filing, excluding the Exchange Transaction mentioned above, the Company has received requests to convert 0.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and all but 5,000 in aggregate principal requested prior to June 30, 2024 have been settled as of June 30, 2024. These conversions resulted in the issuance of a nominal number of shares of the Company s common stock to the note holders. The remaining 5,000 in aggregate principal will settle with the 2019 Notes that are submitted for conversion prior to July 11, 2024. We will use proceeds from the Exchange Transaction to finance in part, the settlement upon conversion of the remaining 2019 Notes at maturity on July 15, 2024.

Operating activities (As Restated) 
 For the six months ended June 30, 2024, our operating activities provided cash of 86.9 million reflecting net income of 9.0 million and non-cash charges totaling 65.3 million primarily related to depreciation, intangible amortization, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, stock-based compensation charges, deferred income taxes and operating lease right of use asset amortization. We had a decrease in inventory manufactured that provided 10.5 million, a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 3.8 million, primarily due to an increase in unearned revenue and accrued employee bonuses, and a net increase in operating lease liability due to new operating leases entered into during 2024 providing cash of 7.5 million. An decrease in prepaid expenses, primarily related to subscriptions and taxes consumed 0.5 million. The remaining cash used in operating activities resulted from unfavorable changes in various other working capital accounts. 
 For the six months ended June 30, 2023, our operating activities provided cash of 45.6 million reflecting net income of 35.1 million and non-cash charges totaling 51.4 million primarily related to depreciation, amortization, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation charges and operating lease right of use asset amortization. An increase in accounts receivable consumed 4.6 million of cash and was primarily driven by the timing of collections from customers. Additionally, we had an increase in inventory manufactured that consumed 2.5 million and an 12.9 million increase in prepaid expenses, primarily related to prepaid taxes and subscriptions. A decrease in accounts payable consumed 3.9 million and was due to the timing of payments to vendors. A decrease in accrued liabilities consumed 11.8 million primarily related to the payment of employee bonuses during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The remaining cash provided by operating activities resulted from favorable changes in various other working capital accounts. 
 Investing activities 
 Our investing activities consumed 15.8 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2024, which was due to capital expenditures during 2024. Included in this amount were capitalized costs related to our internal-use software for the six months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Our investing activities provided 55.4 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the maturity of our short-term investment in U.S. treasury securities in June 2023, which provided cash of 102.3 million. We used 28.1 million in cash (net of cash received) for the FlexBiosys Acquisition. Capital expenditures consumed 18.8 million in 2023 as we continued to increase our manufacturing capacity worldwide. Of these expenditures, 2.1 million represented capitalized costs related to our internal-use software for the six months ended June 30, 2023. 
 Financing activities 
 Our financing activities consumed 14.7 million of cash for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily for 8.9 million in cash disbursed for shares withheld to cover employee income tax due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units and the payments of 2.2 million and 5.2 million to settle the cash portion of the contingent earnout obligations related to our acquisition of FlexBiosys in April 2023 and Avitide in September 2021, respectively. These payments were partially offset by proceeds received from stock option exercises during the period. 
 Our financing activities consumed 18.4 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily for 11.1 million of cash disbursed in relation to shares withheld to cover employee income tax due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units and the payment of 7.3 million to settle the cash portion of the contingent earnout obligation related to our acquisition of Avitide. This was partially offset by proceeds received from stock option exercises during the period. 
 40 

Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 
 The effect of exchange rate changes on cash during the six months ended June 30, 2024 is a result of the weakening of the Swedish krona against the U.S. dollar by 5 and the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar by 3 . 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the following: 
 the expansion of our bioprocessing business; 

the ability to sustain sales and profits of our bioprocessing products and successfully integrate them into our business; 

our ability to acquire additional bioprocessing products; 

the scope of and progress made in our R D activities; 

the scope of investment in our intellectual property portfolio; 

contingent consideration earnout payments resulting from our acquisitions; 

the extent of any share repurchase activity; 

the success of any proposed financing efforts; 

general economic and capital markets; 

change in accounting standards; 

the impact of inflation on our operations, including our expenditures on raw materials and freight charges; 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and 

costs associated with our ability to comply with, emerging environmental, social and governance standards. 

Absent acquisitions of additional products, product candidates or intellectual property and absent the need to satisfy any debt conversions, we believe our current cash balances are adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next 24 months from the date of this filing. We expect operating expenses for the remainder of the fiscal year to increase as we continue to expand our bioprocessing business. We expect to incur continued spending related to the development and expansion of our bioprocessing product lines and expansion of our commercial capabilities for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements may include, but are not limited to, purchases of property, plant and equipment, the acquisition of additional bioprocessing products and technologies to complement our existing manufacturing capabilities and continued investment in our intellectual property portfolio. 
 We plan to continue to invest in our bioprocessing business and in key R D activities associated with the development of new bioprocessing products. We actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including acquiring products, technologies or businesses that would complement our existing portfolio. We continue to seek to acquire such potential assets that may offer us the best opportunity to create value for our shareholders. In order to acquire such assets, we may need to seek additional financing to fund these investments. If our available cash balances and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including because of any such acquisition-related financing needs, the need to fund debt conversions, or due to lower demand for our products, we may seek to sell common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding, or seek other debt funding. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders, and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any other third-party funding arrangement could require us to relinquish valuable rights. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryforwards (As Restated) 
 At December 31, 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of 31.1 million, state net operating loss carryforwards of 4.8 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of 4.9 million. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2043, while the federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards have unlimited carryforward periods and do not expire. We had federal and state business tax credits carryforwards of 5.8 million available to reduce future federal and state income taxes. The business tax credits carryforwards will expire at various dates through December 2043. Net operating loss carryforwards and available tax credits are subject to review and possible adjustment 
 41 

by the Internal Revenue Service, state and foreign jurisdictions and may be limited in the event of certain changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders. 
 Effects of Inflation 
 Our assets are primarily monetary, consisting mainly of cash and cash equivalents. Because of their liquidity, these assets are not directly affected by inflation. Since we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment, furniture, fixtures and office equipment, computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements, we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as those for employee compensation and contract services, which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources. 
 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Amendment contains forward-looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The forward-looking statements in this Amendment do not constitute guarantees of future performance. Investors are cautioned that statements in this Amendment which are not strictly historical statements, including, without limitation, express or implied statements or guidance regarding current or future financial performance and position, potential impairment of future earnings, management s strategy, plans and objectives for future operations or acquisitions, expectations and beliefs for recently-completed acquisitions, product development and sales, restructuring activities and the expected results thereof, product candidate research, development and regulatory approval, SG A expenditures, intellectual property, development and manufacturing plans, availability of materials and product and adequacy of capital resources, our financing plans and the projected continued impact of, and response to, COVID-19 constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which the Company operates, and management s beliefs and assumptions. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise the statements in light of future developments. In addition, other written and oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements may be made by the Company or on the Company s behalf. Words such as expect, seek, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, could, estimate, may, target, project, or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including, without limitation, risks associated with the following: the success of current and future collaborative or supply relationships, including our agreements with Cytiva, MilliporeSigma and Purolite Life Sciences, an Ecolab Inc. company; our ability to successfully grow our bioprocessing business, including as a result of acquisitions, commercialization or partnership opportunities, and our ability to develop and commercialize products; our ability to obtain required regulatory approvals; our compliance with all U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, our ability to obtain, maintain and protect intellectual property rights for our products; the risk of litigation regarding our patent and other intellectual property rights; the risk of litigation with collaborative partners; our manufacturing capabilities and our dependence on third-party manufacturers and value-added resellers; our ability to hire and retain skilled personnel; the market acceptance of our products, reduced demand for our products that adversely impacts our future revenues, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition; our ability to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our business and achieve the expected benefits of the acquisitions; our ability to compete with larger, better financed life sciences companies; our history of losses and expectation of incurring losses; our ability to generate future revenues; our ability to successfully integrate our recently acquired businesses; our ability to raise additional capital to fund potential acquisitions; our volatile stock price; and the effects of our anti-takeover provisions. Further information on potential risk factors that could affect our financial results are included in the filings made by us from time to time with the SEC including under the sections entitled Risk Factors in our Form 10-K/A. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AN D PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate DCPs (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). DCPs are those controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is 
 42 

accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company carried out an evaluation as of June 30, 2024 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s DCPs pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b). Based on such evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the previously reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are described in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2023, and as disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K/A, the Company identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting: 
 1. A material weakness in the operation of our controls over the deferred income tax accounting for complex and non-routine transactions. Specifically, management did not have adequate supervision and review controls over the complex accounting for deferred income tax on the exchange of our outstanding 0.375 Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 and the issuance of 1.00 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028, including work performed by external advisors and the internal review of such transaction and related analyses. 

2. As a result of the restatement, a material weakness related to the design and operating effectiveness of controls related to revenue recognition specific to the evaluation of accounting for contract terms. 

As of June 30, 2024, the Company has not remediated these material weaknesses. As a result, the Company s management concluded that at June 30, 2024, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective. 
 Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses 
 As previously disclosed in the Form 10-K/A, management is implementing remedial actions under the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to address the identified deficiencies. 
 Our income tax remediation efforts include the following activities: 
 Improve our process to identify and select qualified third-party advisors, including enhanced review of capabilities and work performed, specifically related to the review of tax advice and related accounting guidance. 

Implement a process to verify the controls, processes and internal reviews performed by third-party advisors. 

Consider whether the non-routine transaction warrants additional advisor oversight or validation of analyses based on complexity or changes in applicable regulations. 

Increase education for internal resources on complex transactions to enhance diligence capabilities with third-party advisors. 

Our revenue recognition remediation efforts include the following activities: 
 Designing new internal controls to validate there is a complete listing of revenue contracts that have non-standard terms, which require incremental accounting analysis under ASC 606. 

Designing new internal controls evaluating the accounting for contract amendments, including amendments accounted for as contract modifications. 

Enhancing and expanding our existing revenue recognition control procedures and attributes when evaluating the accounting impact of non-standard contract terms and contract modifications. 

Increasing education for internal resources on accounting for contracts within the scope of ASC 606 and deploying enablers to facilitate documentation of accounting analyses and conclusions. 

43 

We will continue to monitor the design and operating effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls and make any further changes management determines appropriate. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 Except for the material weaknesses described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred in the three months ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 44 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The matters discussed in this Amendment include forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but are based on various assumptions by management regarding future circumstances, over many of which Repligen has little or no control. A number of important risks and uncertainties, including those identified under the caption Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the period ended December 31, 2023 Form 10-K/A and in subsequent filings, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. 
 As contemplated in Item 1A, entitled Risk Factors, in the Company's Form 10-K/A, the Company has in the past and may in the future experience data security incidents. If successful, these attacks could affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. The Company is updating the risk factor captioned Our internal computer systems, or those of our customers, collaborators or other contractors, may be subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs to reference the following incident: 
 As described on the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 15, 2024, on July 9, 2024, the Company discovered that an unauthorized third party had accessed certain files on the Company s information systems. Based on information currently known as of the date of this Amendment and management s current assessment of quantitative and qualitative factors (including reputational harm, adverse impacts on relationships with vendors, customers and other business partners, and the impact of the foregoing on the Company s stockholders), the Company does not believe this incident will have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as of the date this Amendment other than the Company s response and remediation activities, the incident has not had an impact on the Company s business or operations. 
 Other than the foregoing, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, entitled Risk Factors, in the Company s Form 10-K/A.
