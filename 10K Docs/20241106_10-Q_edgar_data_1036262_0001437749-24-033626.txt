 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(In thousands, except share and per share data) 

comprised of: (i) EUR , or , in cash; and (ii) shares of our common stock, valued at based on the closing price of our stock on the date of acquisition. The cash portion of the purchase price was subject to customary working capital adjustments. These adjustments were finalized in June 2024 and resulted in recording an additional EUR , or , in purchase price for assets delivered at closing in excess of agreed upon thresholds. The liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition included debt of approximately EUR , or . The acquisition is discussed further in Note 3. The debt assumed is discussed further in Note 10. 

The consolidated entity is comprised of inTEST Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We manufacture our products in the U.S., Italy, Canada and the Netherlands. Marketing and support activities are conducted worldwide from our facilities in the U.S., Italy, Canada, Germany, Singapore, the Netherlands, China and the U.K. We operate our business worldwide and sell our products both domestically and internationally. 

All of our operating segments have multiple products that we design, manufacture and market to our customers. Due to a number of factors, our products have varying levels of gross margin. The mix of products we sell in any period is ultimately determined by our customers needs. Therefore, the mix of products sold in any given period can change significantly from the prior period. In addition, we sell our products to a variety of different types of customers with varying levels of discounts and commission expense. As a result of changes in both the mix of products sold as well as customer mix in any given period, our consolidated gross margin can vary significantly from period to period. 

The semiconductor market semi or the semi market which includes both the broader semiconductor market, as well as the more specialized automated test equipment ATE and wafer production sectors within the broader semiconductor market, has historically been the largest single market in which we operate. The semi market is characterized by rapid technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical as well as seasonal market patterns. The semi market is also subject to periods of significant expansion or contraction in demand. In addition to the semi market, we sell into a variety of other markets. Our intention is to continue diversifying our markets, our product offerings within the markets we serve and our customer base across all of our markets with the goal of reducing our dependence on any one market, product or customer. In particular, we are seeking to reduce the impact of volatility in the semi market on our results of operations. 

Our Electronic Test segment sells many of its products to semiconductor manufacturers and third-party test and assembly houses (end user sales) and to ATE manufacturers (original equipment manufacturer OEM sales), who ultimately resell our equipment with theirs to both semiconductor manufacturers and third-party test and assembly houses. These sales all fall within the ATE sector of the semi market. With the acquisition of Acculogic Inc. and its affiliates Acculogic in December 2021, and Alfamation in March 2024, our Electronic Test segment also sells its products to customers in markets outside the semi market including the automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial and life sciences and specialty consumer electronics markets. Our Environmental Technologies segment sells its products to end users and OEMs within the ATE sector of the semi market. It also sells its products to customers in a variety of other markets other than the semi market, including the automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial and life sciences markets. Our Process Technologies segment sells its products to customers in the wafer production sector within the semi market. It also sells its products to customers in a variety of other markets other than the semi market, including the automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, life sciences and security markets. 

Our financial results are affected by a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions worldwide and in the markets in which we operate, economic conditions specific to the semi market and the other markets we serve, downward pricing pressures from customers, our reliance on a relatively few number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and our ability to safeguard patented technology and intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of obsolescence of our inventory depending on the mix of future business and technological changes within the markets that we serve. Part of our strategy for growth includes potential acquisitions that may cause us to incur substantial expense in reviewing and evaluating potential transactions. We may or may not be successful in locating suitable businesses to acquire and in closing acquisitions of businesses we pursue. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we do acquire with our existing business and we may not be able to operate the acquired business profitably. As a result of these or other factors, we may experience significant period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results. 

On May 11, 2023, we entered into an At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the "Sales Agreement") pursuant to which we issued and sold shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of between May 11, 2023 and May 31, 2023. We received net proceeds from the sale of these shares of after payment of commissions of of the gross proceeds and other fees related to the sale of these shares. 

Reclassification 
 
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to be comparable with the current period's presentation. 

of the allowance for credit losses to offset the write-off of receivables in our Electronic Test segment. There were no other significant changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses during this time period. There was no bad debt expense recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a bad debt recovery of . This amount had been fully written off prior to our acquisition of Acculogic and was no longer in our accounts receivable balance. 

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. As a part of the impairment assessment, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, as a result of our qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 

Long-lived assets, which consist of finite-lived intangible assets, property and equipment and right-of-use ROU assets, are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset group. If impairment is indicated, the asset group is written down to its estimated fair value. The cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment, if any, contain management's best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time. 

Occasionally we procure and sell materials/components on behalf of and to our customers. 

Types of Contracts with Customers 

Our contracts with customers are generally structured as individual purchase orders which specify the exact products or services being sold or equipment being leased along with the selling price, service fee or monthly lease amount for each individual item on the purchase order. Payment terms and any other customer-specific acceptance criteria are also specified on the purchase order. We generally do not have any customer-specific acceptance criteria, other than that the product performs within the agreed upon specifications. We test substantially all products manufactured as part of our quality assurance process to determine that they comply with specifications prior to shipment to a customer. 

Contract Balances 

We record accounts receivable at the time of invoicing. Accounts receivable, net of the allowance for credit losses, is included in current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In certain instances, we also receive customer deposits in advance of invoicing and recording of accounts receivable. Customer deposits are included in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent that we do not recognize revenue at the same time as we invoice, we record a liability for deferred revenue. Deferred revenue estimated to be recognized within the next twelve months is included in current liabilities. Deferred revenue that we estimate will be recognized beyond twelve months is recorded in Other Liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Any non-inventoriable costs associated with deferred revenue are also deferred and recorded in Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets or Other Assets on our consolidated balance sheets, depending on when the related deferred revenue is expected to be recognized. 

As discussed above, we follow the guidance in ASC Topic 326 in developing our estimate of the allowance for credit losses related to our accounts receivable. The allowance for credit losses is our best estimate of the amount of expected credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We monitor the collectability of accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and record charges for bad debt expense in the period when we determine that a loss is expected to occur based on our assessment. 

Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer 

The only costs we incur associated with obtaining contracts with customers are sales commissions that we pay to our internal sales personnel or third-party sales representatives. These costs are calculated based on set percentages of the selling price of each product or service sold. Commissions are considered earned by our internal sales personnel at the time we recognize revenue for a particular transaction. Commissions are considered earned by third-party sales representatives at the time that revenue is recognized for a particular transaction. We record commission expense in our consolidated statements of operations at the time the commission is earned. Commissions earned but not yet paid are included in current liabilities on our balance sheets. 

Product Warranties 

In connection with the sale of our products, we generally provide standard one- or two-year product warranties which are detailed in our terms and conditions and communicated to our customers. Our standard warranties are not offered for sale separately from our products; therefore, there is not a separate performance obligation related to our standard warranties. We record estimated warranty expense for our standard warranties at the time of sale based upon historical claims experience. We offer customers an option to separately purchase an extended warranty on certain products. In the case of extended warranties, we recognize revenue in the amount of the sale price for the extended warranty on a straight-line basis over the extended warranty period. We record costs incurred to provide service under an extended warranty at the time the service is provided. Warranty expense is included in selling expense in our consolidated statements of operations. 

See Notes 6 and 14 for further information about our revenue from contracts with customers. 

to help offset a portion of the cost of the leasehold improvements we made to this facility. The final payment of was received during the three months ended March 31, 2022. In exchange for the funds we received under these agreements, we are required to create and maintain specified levels of employment in this location through various dates ending in 2024. If we fail to meet these employment targets, we may be required to repay a proportionate share of the proceeds. At September 30, 2024, of the total proceeds received could still be required to be repaid if we do not meet the targets. We have recorded this amount as a contingent liability which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Those portions of the proceeds which are no longer subject to repayment are reclassified to deferred grant proceeds and amortized to income on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term for the Rochester facility. Deferred grant proceeds are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities on our balance sheet and totaled at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the employment targets as specified in the grant agreement with the city of Rochester. 

Potentially dilutive securities:

Average number of potentially dilutive securities excluded from calculation because their effect was anti-dilutive during the period 

comprised of: (i) EUR , or , in cash; and (ii) shares of our common stock, valued at based on the closing price of our stock on the date of acquisition. The cash portion of the purchase price was subject to customary working capital adjustments. These adjustments were finalized in June 2024 and resulted in recording an additional EUR , or , in purchase price for assets delivered at closing in excess of agreed upon thresholds. The liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition included debt of approximately EUR , or . The debt assumed is discussed further in Note 10. Total acquisition costs incurred to complete this transaction were . Acquisition costs were expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expense. 

In connection with the acquisition, we have entered into a lease agreement (the Lease Agreement with the former owner of Alfamation who will continue to serve as the managing director of Alfamation under our ownership. The Lease Agreement commenced on March 12, 2024 and will last for six years. It will be automatically renewed for the same period of time unless terminated by either party. Under the terms of the Lease Agreement, Alfamation will lease warehouse and office space totaling about square feet. Alfamation will pay a yearly lease payment of EUR broken up into two equal payments. At the date of the signing of the Lease Agreement, the yearly lease payment equated to approximately . 
 
The acquisition of Alfamation has been accounted for as a business combination using purchase accounting, and, accordingly, the results of Alfamation have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. The allocation of the purchase price for Alfamation is not yet complete. The preliminary allocation of the Alfamation purchase price was based on estimated fair values as of March 12, 2024. We are currently working with third-party valuation specialists to assist us with our purchase accounting. The information that needs to be gathered from multiple sources, including the records and personnel at Alfamation, is not yet fully assembled. As a result, the values reflected below are preliminary and we expect that they may change. Adjustments to these preliminary amounts will be included in the final allocation of the purchase price for Alfamation, which we expect to finalize in the fourth quarter of 2024. These adjustments could be material. 

The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable intangible and net tangible assets was allocated to goodwill and is not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is attributed to synergies that are expected to result from the operations of the combined businesses. 

The total purchase price of has been allocated as follows: 

Identifiable intangible assets 

Tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed: 

Cash 

Trade accounts receivable 

Inventories 

Other current assets 

Property and equipment 

Other assets 

Accounts payable 

Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 

Deferred tax liability 

Debt (current and long-term) 

Other non-current liabilities 

Total purchase price 

We estimated the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired using the income approach. Identifiable intangible assets acquired include customer relationships, customer backlog, technology and a tradename. We are amortizing the finite-lived intangible assets acquired over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are expected to be consumed. 

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of Alfamation s identifiable intangible assets and their estimated useful lives as of the acquisition date:

ASC 820 identifies fair value as the exchange price, or exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that distinguishes among the following: 

Level 1 Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. 

Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and models for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 

Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 

To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 

The interest rate swap agreement we entered into in connection with our Term Note, as discussed further in Notes 2 and 10, is measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs. The contingent consideration liability on our balance sheet is measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs. 
 
Our contingent consideration liability is a result of our acquisition of Acculogic on December 21, 2021, and represents the estimated fair value of the additional cash consideration payable that is contingent upon sales to Electric Vehicle EV or battery customers. We may pay the seller up to an additional CAD in the five-year period from 2022 through 2026. The additional payments will be based on a percent of net invoices for which payments have been received on systems sold to EV or battery customers in excess of CAD per year in each of the five years. The maximum payment is capped at CAD , which equates to approximately at September 30, 2024. There were no payments due to the seller for the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2023. To estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date, an option-based income approach using a Monte Carlo simulation model was utilized due to the non-linear payout structure. As of the acquisition date, this resulted in an estimated fair value of . This amount was recorded as a contingent consideration liability and included in the purchase price as of the acquisition date. We reassess the estimated fair value of this liability annually using this same approach, or more frequently, if we determine that there have been material changes to the assumptions used in the calculation of the probable payout. Changes in the amount of the estimated fair value of the earnouts since the acquisition date are recorded as operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations in the quarter in which they occur. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we reduced the contingent consideration liability by . At September 30, 2024, the contingent consideration had a total estimated fair value of . The current portion of our contingent consideration liability was and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was included in Other Current Liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The non-current portion of the liability is included in Other Liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

Credit Facility 

On October 15, 2021 (the Closing Date ), we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement with M T Bank M T which, on October 28, 2021, was amended by the Joinder and Amendment to Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement and which, on December 30, 2021, was further amended by the Joinder and Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (as amended, the Loan Agreement ). The Loan Agreement included a non-revolving delayed draw term note (the Term Note and a revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility and together with the Term Note, the Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility had a five -year contract period that began on the Closing Date and expired on October 15, 2026, and draws under the Term Note were permissible for two years. 

Since December 30, 2021, we have further amended the Loan Agreement on several occasions. The latest amendment occurred on May 2, 2024, when we entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Amended Loan Agreement ). Under the Amended Loan Agreement, the maximum loan amount that we may borrow under the Term Note was raised to . The available funding at September 30, 2024 under the Term Note was . In addition, the period during which we may request advances under the Term Note was extended until May 2, 2026, and the Term Note and revolving credit facility maturity date was extended from September 19, 2027 to May 2, 2031. 

 At September 30, 2024, we had not borrowed any amounts under the million Revolving Facility. Our borrowings under the Term Note are discussed below and occurred prior to entering into the Amended Loan Agreement. 

The principal balance of the Revolving Facility and the principal balance of any amount drawn under the Term Note accrues interest based on the secured overnight financing rate for U.S. government securities SOFR or a bank-defined base rate plus an applicable margin, depending on leverage. Each draw under the Term Note will have an option for us of either (i) up to a five year amortizing term loan with a balloon due at maturity, or (ii) up to a five year term with up to seven years amortization with a balloon due at maturity. Any amortization greater than five years will be subject to an excess cash flow recapture. The Amended Loan Agreement also allows us to enter into hedging contracts with M T, including interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements, interest rate collar agreements, or any other agreements or that are designed to protect us against fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates. 

The Amended Loan Agreement contains customary default provisions, including but not limited to the failure by us to repay obligations when due, violation of provisions or representations provided in the Amended Loan Agreement, bankruptcy by us, suspension of our business or any of our subsidiaries and certain material judgments. After expiration of the Contract Period or if a continued event of default occurs, interest will accrue on the principal balance at a rate of in excess of the then applicable nondefault interest rate. The Amended Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including a maximum ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA of not more than to 1.0 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to 1.0. Our obligations under the Amended Loan Agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets that are owned as of the Closing Date or acquired thereafter. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants included in the Credit Facility including the debt covenants of the Amended Loan Agreement. 

On October 28, 2021, we drew under the Term Note to finance the acquisition of Videology as discussed above. We also entered into an interest rate swap agreement with M T as of this date which is designed to protect us against fluctuations in interest rates during the five year repayment and amortization period. As a result, the annual interest rate we expect to pay for this draw under the Term Note is fixed at approximately based on current leverage. 

On December 29, 2021, we drew under the Term Note to finance the acquisition of Acculogic as discussed above. We did not enter into an interest rate swap agreement with M T related to this draw. The annual interest rate we expect to pay for this draw under the Term Note is variable. At September 30, 2024, it was approximately based on current leverage. 

The following table sets forth the annual maturities for the balance of the Term Note:

Restricted Stock Awards 
 
We record compensation expense for restricted stock awards based on the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date and amortize the expense over the vesting period. Restricted stock awards generally vest over four years for employees and over one year for our independent directors 25 at each of March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of the year in which they were granted). 

Since August 2020, we have increasingly granted performance-based restricted stock awards where the ultimate number of shares that vest can vary between and of the amount of the original award and is based on the achievement of specified performance metrics. Vesting for these awards is generally cliff vesting at the end of the period over which the performance metrics are measured. Compensation expense for these awards is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and is based on the expected final vesting percentage, which is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted with a catch-up adjustment, as needed. Our initial assumption at the grant date of these awards is that the award will vest at the level. 

On March 10, 2021, we issued restricted stock awards totaling shares to members of senior management within our operating segments. During the first quarter of 2023, of these shares were forfeited when the individual to whom they had been granted resigned from his position with us. The remaining shares vested on the third anniversary of the grant date at vesting percentages of for of the shares and for the remaining shares. The final vesting percentages were based on the achievement of certain performance metrics related to the operating results of the business units for which these members of management are responsible. 

On October 1, 2021, we issued restricted stock awards totaling shares to a member of senior management. These shares will vest on January 1, 2025 at a vesting percentage that could range from to of the number of shares awarded on October 1, 2021. The final vesting percentage will be based on the achievement of certain performance metrics related to our consolidated operating results.

Overview 

This MD A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In addition, please refer to the discussion of our business and markets contained in Part 1, Item 1., of our 2023 Form 10-K. 

We are a global supplier of innovative test and process technology solutions for use in manufacturing and testing across a wide range of markets including automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, life sciences, security and semiconductor. We have three reportable segments which are also our reporting units: Electronic Test (which includes our semiconductor test equipment, flying probe and in-circuit testers and the operations of Alfamation S.p.A., Alfamation which we acquired on March 12, 2024 as discussed further below and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this Report), Environmental Technologies (which includes our thermal test, process and storage products) and Process Technologies (which includes our induction heating and video imaging products). 

All of our operating segments have multiple products that we design, manufacture and market to our customers. Due to a number of factors, our products have varying levels of gross margin. These factors include, for example, the amount of engineering time required to develop the product, the market or customer to which we sell the product and the level of competing products available from other suppliers. The needs of our customers ultimately determine the products that we sell in a given time period. Therefore, the mix of products sold in a given period can change significantly when compared against the prior period. As a result, our consolidated gross margin may be significantly impacted by a change in the mix of products sold in a particular period. 

Markets 

As discussed further in Part 1, Item 1., Markets of our 2023 Form 10-K, we are focused on specific target markets which include automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, life sciences, security as well as both the front-end and back-end of the semiconductor manufacturing industry. The semi market, which includes both the broader semiconductor market, as well as the more specialized ATE and wafer production sectors within the broader semiconductor market, has historically been the largest single market in which we operate. The semi market is characterized by rapid technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical market patterns and is subject to periods of significant expansion or contraction in demand. Our intention is to continue diversifying our markets, our product offerings within the markets we serve and our customer base across all of our markets with the goal of reducing our dependence on any one market, product or customer. In particular, we are seeking to reduce the impact of volatility in the semi market on our results of operations. 

The portion of our business that is derived from the semi market is substantially dependent upon the demand for ATE by semiconductor manufacturers and companies that specialize in the testing of integrated circuits ICs and, for our induction heating products, the demand for wafer production equipment. Demand for ATE or wafer production equipment is primarily driven by semiconductor manufacturers that are opening new, or expanding existing, semiconductor fabrication facilities or upgrading equipment, which in turn is dependent upon the current and anticipated market demand for ICs and products incorporating ICs. Such market demand can be the result of market expansion, development of new technologies or redesigned products to incorporate new features, or the replacement of aging equipment. 

The semi market is highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply, which often severely impact the semi market's demand for the products we manufacture and sell into the market. This cyclicality can cause wide fluctuations in both our orders and revenue and, depending on our ability to react quickly to these shifts in demand, can significantly impact our results of operations. Market cycles are difficult to predict and, because they are generally characterized by sequential periods of growth or declines in orders and revenue during each cycle, year over year comparisons of operating results may not always be as meaningful as comparisons of periods at similar points in either up or down cycles. These periods of heightened or reduced demand can shift depending on various factors impacting both our customers and the markets that they serve. In addition, during both downward and upward cycles in the semi market, in any given quarter, the trend in both our orders and revenue can be erratic. This can occur, for example, when orders are canceled or currently scheduled delivery dates are accelerated or postponed by a significant customer or when customer forecasts and general business conditions fluctuate during a quarter. 

While a significant portion of our orders and revenue are derived from the semi market, and our operating results generally follow the overall trend in the semi market, in any given period we may experience anomalies that cause the trend in our revenue from the semi market to deviate from the overall trend in the market. We believe that these anomalies may be driven by a variety of factors within the semi market, including, for example, changing product requirements, longer periods between new product offerings by OEMs and changes in customer buying patterns. In addition, in recent periods, we have seen instances when demand within the semi market is not consistent for each of our operating segments or for any given product within a particular operating segment. This inconsistency in demand can be driven by a number of factors but, in most cases, we have found that the primary reason is unique customer-specific changes in demand for certain products driven by the needs of their customers or markets served. Recently this has become more pronounced for our sales into the wafer production sector within the broader semiconductor market due to the limited market penetration we have into this sector and the variability of orders we have experienced from the few customers we support. These shifts in market practices and customer-specific needs have had, and may continue to have, varying levels of impact on our operating results and are difficult to quantify or predict from period to period. Management has taken, and will continue to take, such actions it deems appropriate to adjust our strategies, products and operations to counter such shifts in market practices as they become evident.

As discussed further in Part I, Item 1., Overview and Strategy of our 2023 Form 10-K, although the semi market remains our largest market, as part of our strategy to grow our business, we are focused on several other key target markets where we believe our products address test and process requirements and where we believe there is significant potential for growth. These key target markets include the automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, life sciences and security markets. We believe that these markets are usually less cyclical than the semi market. While market share statistics exist for some of these markets, due to the nature of our highly specialized product offerings in these markets, we do not expect broad market penetration in many of these markets and, therefore, do not anticipate developing meaningful market shares in most of these markets. 

In addition, because of our limited market share, our orders and revenue in any given period in these markets do not necessarily reflect the overall trends in these markets. Consequently, we are continuing to evaluate buying patterns and opportunities for growth in these, and other, markets that may affect our performance. The level of our orders and revenue in all of the markets we serve has varied in the past, and we expect will vary significantly in the future, as we work to build our presence in our current markets and establish new markets for our products. 

Acquisition 

As discussed further in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this Report, on March 12, 2024 we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding capital shares of Alfamation, a leading global provider of state-of-the-art test and measurement solutions for the automotive, life sciences and specialty consumer electronics markets. Alfamation was founded in 1991 and is headquartered in Milan, Italy. Alfamation also has a small sales and service subsidiary based in Suzhou City, China. Alfamation is included in our Electronic Test operating segment. The aggregate purchase price was approximately EUR 20 million comprised of EUR 18 million in cash, or 19.7 million, and 187,432 shares of our common stock valued at 2.1 million based on the closing price of our stock on the date of acquisition. The cash portion of the purchase price is subject to customary working capital adjustments. This resulted in an additional payment of EUR 129,000, or 141,000 for assets delivered at closing in excess of agreed upon thresholds. This equates to a total purchase price of approximately 21.9 million. The liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition included debt of approximately EUR 10.3 million, or 11.3 million. The debt assumed is discussed further in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in this Report. 

In connection with the acquisition, on March 12, 2024 we entered into a lease agreement (the Lease Agreement with the former owner of Alfamation who will continue to serve as the managing director of Alfamation under our ownership. The Lease Agreement will last for six years and will be automatically renewed for the same period of time unless terminated by either party. Under the terms of the Lease Agreement, Alfamation will lease warehouse and office space totaling about 51,817 square feet. Alfamation will pay a yearly lease payment of EUR 260,000 broken up into two equal payments. At the date of the signing of the Lease Agreement, the yearly lease payment equated to approximately 284,000.

Consolidated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 30.3 million compared to 30.9 million for the same period in 2023 and 34.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 94.1 million compared to 95.4 million for the same period in 2023. Alfamation, which we acquired on March 12, 2024 as discussed under Acquisition in the Overview section above, contributed 5.4 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2024, 9.7 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2024 and 16.5 million of revenue from the date of acquisition through September 30, 2024. This revenue is primarily from the auto/EV market, and, to a lesser extent, the life sciences market. 

Compared with the same period in 2023, our consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 669,000. The 5.4 million in revenue contributed by Alfamation in combination with a 1.1 million increase in revenue from the industrial market and a 1.3 million increase in revenue for other markets helped to offset a 7.1 million decline in revenue from the semi market as that market remains in a period of reduced demand. Compared with the same period in 2023, our consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.3 million, reflecting an 18.5 million decline from the semi market which was partially offset by the revenue contributed by Alfamation and, to a lesser extent, a 2.8 million increase from the industrial market. As discussed in the Overview section above, the semi market is highly cyclical resulting in significant swings in demand when period to period comparisons are to different points in a given cycle. The current period of weakened demand began to impact us in the second half of 2023 resulting in significantly reduced revenue levels from our customers in this market. There are indications from certain of our back-end semi customers that demand seems to be stabilizing in that market. We have not yet seen any similar indications from our front-end semi customers. 

Orders and Backlog 
 
We use orders and backlog as key performance metrics to analyze and measure our financial performance and results of operations. We define orders as purchase orders that we have accepted from our customers. Orders are recorded based on the date received and accepted by us. We believe tracking orders is useful in planning for future production needs and staffing levels and we use information about the level of our orders to make decisions about resource allocation, including appropriate levels of inventory purchases and the balance of inventory we carry at any given time. Another important operational measure used is backlog. Backlog is a common measurement used in industries with extended lead times for order fulfillment, like those in which we operate. Backlog at any given date represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize for unfilled orders received as of that date. We believe backlog is useful and use this information for similar reasons to those detailed above for orders. The majority of our backlog at any given time is expected to be fulfilled within the next twelve months. Depending on the terms of the purchase orders we have accepted, customers may have the ability to cancel an order or accelerate or postpone currently scheduled delivery dates. In some cases, we may have the ability to charge a cancellation fee if a purchase order we have accepted is later cancelled by a customer. Given that both orders and backlog are operational measures and our methodology for calculating orders and backlog do not meet the definition of a non-GAAP measure, as that term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), a quantitative reconciliation for each is not required or provided. 

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a breakdown of the orders received by market (in thousands).

Consolidated orders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 28.1 million compared to 26.9 million for the same period in 2023 and 26.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Consolidated orders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 77.0 million compared to 89.1 million for the same period in 2023. Alfamation contributed 3.9 million of orders in the third quarter of 2024, 3.2 million of orders in the second quarter of 2024 and 8.8 million of orders from the date of acquisition through September 30, 2024. 

During both the three and nine months ended September 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, the orders contributed by Alfamation helped to offset the aforementioned decline in demand from the semi market. During these same periods, we have also experienced increased demand from our customers in the defense/aerospace market and other markets we serve which also helped to offset the decline from the semi market. 

At September 30, 2024, our backlog of unfilled orders for all products was approximately 45.5 million compared with approximately 40.5 million at September 30, 2023 and 47.7 million at June 30, 2024. Our backlog at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 included 14.7 million and 16.3 million, respectively, of backlog for Alfamation. Our backlog includes customer orders that we have accepted, substantially all of which we expect to deliver in the next twelve months. While backlog is calculated on the basis of firm purchase orders, a customer may cancel an order or accelerate or postpone currently scheduled delivery dates. Our backlog may be affected by the tendency of customers to rely on short lead times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of depressed demand. In periods of increased demand, there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog. As a result, our backlog at a particular date is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period. 

Israel-Hamas War, War in Ukraine and Global Supply Chain Constraints 

In early October 2023, Hamas attacked Israel and Israel formally declared war in response to the attack. The conflict with Hamas and others in the region is ongoing, and it is unclear when it might end. Ambrell has a sole source supplier of capacitors used in certain of our induction heating products that is located in Israel. This supplier is the sole source supplier of capacitors for numerous induction companies, and currently there are no viable alternatives available. We have been in frequent contact with our supplier since the conflict with Hamas began. We maintain a two-to-three month safety stock on these items. Our supplier has indicated that they have large stock available at more than one facility in Israel, so they believe they have redundancies in place that will help ensure that the supply chain to their customers is uninterrupted. We continue to monitor the situation closely and are staying in close contact with our supplier. However, there can be no assurance that the situation will not worsen which could impact our ability to ship certain of our induction heating products which could have a material impact on our future results of operations. 

The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine continues to contribute to global inflationary pressures and the availability of certain raw materials produced in that region, further exacerbating global supply chain challenges that emerged after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Acculogic purchases certain material from a key sole-source supplier in Belarus, which is bordered by Russia to the east and northeast and Ukraine to the south. At present, we are still receiving shipments from this supplier, and we estimate that we have a three-to-four-month supply of these parts that we are maintaining. We are currently in the process of qualifying an alternate supplier for these parts. We received prototype sample parts from the alternate supplier which we are now evaluating. We expect to complete this evaluation by the first quarter of 2025. We are also looking for additional alternate suppliers for these parts in North America. 

-32-

In addition, while the supply chain and logistics challenges that we encountered throughout 2022 have eased, uncertainty in the global trade environment remains. As a result, we expect that we may continue to experience increased prices, lack of availability and logistics delays from time to time for the foreseeable future. The actions we have taken and are continuing to take to mitigate these risks include qualifying new vendors as alternate sources in our supply chain, increasing our inventory of raw materials and ordering further in advance of when we expect to need materials than has been our practice in the past. We have also increased the prices that we charge our customers, where appropriate, and continue to work with our customers to find alternate options for the shipment of products where they control aspects of the logistics process. However, the environment in which we operate is dynamic and shifts rapidly at times, and the success of our efforts to mitigate and address the impacts on our business may not be successful. As a result, we could see increases in our costs or reduced revenues which would impact the level of our earnings in future periods. 

Please refer to Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of the risks associated with our business operations, including risks associated with foreign operations. 

Results of Operations 

The results of operations for our three operating segments are generally affected by the same factors described in the Overview section above. Separate discussions and analyses for each segment would be repetitive. The discussion and analysis that follows, therefore, is presented on a consolidated basis and includes discussion of factors unique to a particular operating segment where significant to an understanding of that segment. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenue. Revenue was 30.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 30.9 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 669,000 or 2 . Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 included 5.4 million attributable to Alfamation which we acquired on March 12, 2024, as discussed under Acquisition in the Overview section above. The decline in revenue primarily reflects the aforementioned weak demand from semi market customers, as discussed under Revenue in the Overview section above, which was partially offset by the revenue from Alfamation as well as increased revenue from customers in the industrial market. 

Gross Margin. Our consolidated gross margin was 46 of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 47 of revenue for the same period in 2023. The decrease in our gross margin primarily reflects higher fixed operating costs and increased direct labor as a result of the costs attributable to Alfamation. The fixed operating costs for the balance of our business were relatively unchanged. The increase in fixed operating costs and direct labor attributable to Alfamation was partially offset by lower average component material costs, reflecting changes in product mix. 
 
 Selling Expense. Selling expense was relatively unchanged at 4.3 million in each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in selling costs attributable to Alfamation was offset by lower commission expense and reduced spending in the balance of our business on third-party services, freight and advertising. 
 
 Engineering and Product Development Expense. Engineering and product development expense was 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.8 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 380,000 or 21 . The increase primarily reflects the additional costs attributable to Alfamation. The costs for the balance of our business were relatively unchanged. 

General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense was 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.9 million for the same period in 2023 an increase of 1.2 million, or 20 . Alfamation accounted for approximately 1.7 million of our general and administrative expense during the third quarter of 2024, which included 459,000 of amortization of acquired intangible assets. In addition, during the third quarter of 2023, we recorded a 358,000 decrease in contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Acculogic which we completed in December 2021. There was no similar adjustment in the third quarter of 2024. The remainder of the change in general and administrative expense in the balance of our business primarily reflects a reduction in costs associated with corporate development activities in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Income Tax Expense. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 74,000 compared to income tax expense of 446,000 for the same period in 2023. Our effective tax rate was 13 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16 for the same period in 2023. On a quarterly basis, we record income tax expense or benefit based on the expected annualized effective tax rate for the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate our businesses. 

-33-

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenue. Revenue was 94.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 95.4 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 1.3 million, or 1 . Alfamation contributed 16.5 million of revenue from the date of acquisition through September 30, 2024. The decline in revenue primarily reflects the aforementioned weak demand from semi market customers, as discussed under Revenue in the Overview section, which was partially offset by the revenue from Alfamation as well as increased revenue from customers in the industrial market. 

Gross Margin. Our consolidated gross margin was 44 of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 47 of revenue for the same period in 2023. The decrease in our gross margin primarily reflects higher fixed operating costs and increased direct labor as a result of the costs attributable to Alfamation. The fixed operating costs for the balance of our business were relatively unchanged in total. Increases in salary and benefits expense were offset by reductions in facility related costs, plant and packing supplies and freight costs. The increase in fixed operating costs and direct labor attributable to Alfamation was partially offset by lower average component material costs, reflecting changes in product mix. 
 
 Selling Expense. Selling expense was 13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 13.4 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 435,000, or 3 . The decrease primarily reflects lower commissions on the lower revenue level and reduced costs for third-party services. This decrease was partially offset by increased travel costs and costs attributable to Alfamation. 
 
 Engineering and Product Development Expense. Engineering and product development expense was 6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.7 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 693,000 or 12 . The increase primarily reflects the additional costs attributable to Alfamation. The costs for the balance of our business were relatively unchanged in total. Increases in salary and benefits expense and the use of third-party resources was offset by declines in spending on materials used in product development and lower legal fees related to our intellectual property. 

General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense was 20.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16.1 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 4.1 million or 26 . Alfamation accounted for approximately 3.8 million of our general and administrative expense during the first nine months of 2024, which included 962,000 of amortization of acquired intangible assets. In addition, during the first nine months of 2023, we recorded a 358,000 decrease in contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Acculogic which we completed in December 2021. This compares to recording a 50,000 reduction in contingent consideration during comparable period in 2024. In the balance of our business, increased fees for professionals that assist us with various compliance related matters and higher salaries and benefits expense were partially offset by reduced accruals for profit-based bonuses and reduced costs related to our stock-based compensation awards as the probable achievement estimates for certain performance-based awards were adjusted down during the first nine months of 2024. 

Income Tax Expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 265,000 compared to income tax expense of 1.6 million for the same period in 2023. Our effective tax rate was 16 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17 for the same period in 2023. On a quarterly basis, we record income tax expense or benefit based on the expected annualized effective tax rate for the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate our businesses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
As discussed more fully in the Overview section above, our business and results of operations are substantially dependent upon the demand for ATE by semiconductor manufacturers and companies that specialize in the testing of ICs. The cyclical and volatile nature of demand for ATE makes estimates of future revenues, results of operations and net cash flows difficult. 

Our primary historical source of liquidity and capital resources has been cash flow generated by our operations. In 2021, we also utilized our Credit Facility, which is discussed below, to fund our acquisitions. We manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as our primary source of liquidity for our short-term cash requirements, as discussed below. We use cash to fund growth in our operating assets, for new product research and development, for acquisitions and for stock repurchases. We currently anticipate that any additional long-term cash requirements related to our strategy would be funded through a combination of our cash and cash equivalents, our Credit Facility or by issuing equity. 

Proceeds from Sale of Common Stock 

On May 11, 2023, we entered into an At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the "Sales Agreement") pursuant to which we issued and sold 921,797 shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of 20.0 million between May 11, 2023 and May 31, 2023. We received net proceeds from the sale of these shares of 19.2 million after payment of commissions of 3.0 of the gross proceeds and other fees related to the sale of these shares.

Credit Facility 

As discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in this Report, on October 15, 2021, we entered into the Loan Agreement with M T. The Loan Agreement includes a 25 million non-revolving delayed draw term note (the Term Note and a 10 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility and together with the Term Note, the Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility had a five-year contract period that began on the Closing Date and expired on October 15, 2026, and draws under the Term Note were permissible for two years. 

On September 20, 2022, we further amended the Loan Agreement by entering into a Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement as amended by the Third Amendment, the Third Amended Loan Agreement and the Third Amended and Restated Delayed Draw Term Note 1A. Under the Third Amended Loan Agreement, the maximum loan amount that we may borrow under the Term Note increased from 25 million to 50.5 million, which raises the available funding at September, 2024 to 30 million. On May 2, 2024 we further amended our Third Amended Loan Agreement by entering into a Fourth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Amended Loan Agreement ). Under the Amended Loan Agreement, the period during which we may request advances under the Term Note is extended until May 2, 2026, and the Term Note and revolving credit facility maturity date is extended from September 19, 2027 to May 2, 2031. At September 30, 2024, we had not borrowed any amounts under the 10 million Revolving Facility. Our borrowings under the Term Note are discussed below and occurred prior to entering into the Amended Loan Agreement. The principal balance of the Revolving Facility and the principal balance of any amount drawn under the Term Note accrues interest based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or a bank-defined base rate plus an applicable margin, depending on leverage. The Amended Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including a maximum ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to 1.0. Our obligations under the Amended Loan Agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants included in the Credit Facility including the debt covenants of the Amended Loan Agreement. 

On October 28, 2021, we drew 12 million under the Term Note to finance the acquisition of Videology. We also entered into an interest rate swap agreement with M T as of this date which is designed to protect us against fluctuations in interest rates during the five-year repayment and amortization period. As a result, the annual interest rate we expect to pay for this draw under the Term Note is fixed at approximately 3.2 based on current leverage. 

On December 29, 2021, we drew 8.5 million under the Term Note to finance the acquisition of Acculogic. We did not enter into an interest rate swap agreement with M T related to this draw. The annual interest rate we expect to pay for this draw under the Term Note is variable. At September 30, 2024, it was approximately 7.0 based on current leverage. 

Alfamation Debt 

In connection with the acquisition of Alfamation, as discussed further in Note 3, we assumed debt which totaled 11.3 million as of the acquisition date. The debt acquired is comprised of both fixed and variable rate bank issued term loans as well as short-term variable rate financing backed by Alfamation s accounts receivable. This debt is spread across a number of different institutions with monthly, quarterly or half-yearly repayment schedules. 

At September 30, 2024, Alfamation s debt was valued at 7.1 million, including 1.9 million that is backed by Alfamation s accounts receivable. The reduction since the acquisition date represents repayments of short-term instruments and principal payments on long-term debt, net of new borrowings that are backed by Alfamation s accounts receivable, The average interest rate being paid at September 30, 2024 was 1.2 for fixed rate debt and 4.7 for variable rate debt. The average rate for total debt at September 30, 2024 was 3.9 . 
 
Total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to our various debt arrangements was 612,000 and 526,000, respectively. 

Liquidity 
 
Our cash and cash equivalents and working capital were as follows (in thousands): 

September 30, 

			 2024 

December 31, 

			 2023 

Cash and cash equivalents 

17,972 

45,260 

Working capital 

45,263 

61,479 

As of September 30, 2024, 8.2 million, or 46 , of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We currently expect our cash and cash equivalents, in combination with the borrowing capacity available under our Revolving Facility and the anticipated net cash to be provided by our operations in the next twelve months to be sufficient to support our short-term working capital requirements and other corporate requirements. Our Revolving Facility is discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in this Report. 

-35-

Our material short-term cash requirements include payments due under our various lease agreements, recurring payroll and benefits obligations to our employees, purchase commitments for materials that we use in the products we sell and principal and interest payments on our debt. We anticipate making investments in our business in the next twelve months including hiring of additional staff, updates to our systems and investments related to our geographic and market expansion efforts. We estimate that our minimum short-term working capital requirements currently range between 8.0 million and 10.0 million. We expect our current cash and cash equivalents, in combination with the borrowing capacity available under our Revolving Facility and the anticipated net cash to be provided by our operations to be sufficient to support these additional investments as well as our current short-term cash requirements. 

Our current strategy for growth includes pursuing acquisition opportunities for complementary businesses, technologies or products. As previously discussed, we currently anticipate that any additional long-term cash requirements related to our strategy would be funded through a combination of our cash and cash equivalents, the remaining availability under the Term Note or by issuing equity. The borrowing availability under the Term Note was expanded and extended in September 2022 and May 2024 as discussed above and in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in this Report. 

Cash Flows 

Operating Activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net earnings of 1.4 million and net cash provided by operations was 1.2 million. During this same period, we had non-cash charges of 4.5 million for depreciation and amortization which included 1.0 million of amortization related to our ROU assets and our operating lease liabilities declined 1.2 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 1.5 million for amortization of deferred compensation expense related to stock-based awards. Excluding the impact of the acquired assets, during the first nine months of 2024, accounts receivable increased 3.7 million and accounts payable decreased 1.0 million while inventories were relatively unchanged. During this same period, domestic and foreign income taxes payable declined 817,000, prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased 569,000, and accrued wages and benefits declined 533,000. All of these fluctuations represent normal variations due to varying timing of payments, receipt of cash from customers and normal accruals that are standard in our business operations. 

Investing Activities . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 18.7 million in net cash for the acquisition of Alfamation which is discussed in more detail in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this Report. Purchases of property and equipment were 1.2 million during this period, representing capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We have no significant commitments for capital expenditures for the balance of 2024; however, depending upon changes in market demand or manufacturing and sales strategies, we may make such purchases or investments as we deem necessary and appropriate. These additional cash requirements would be funded by our cash and cash equivalents, anticipated net cash to be provided by operations and our revolving credit facility. 

Financing Activities . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid 5.5 million of long-term debt, 1.9 million of short-term debt and we used 1.0 million to repurchase stock. There were no other significant amounts used by or received from financing activities during the quarter. 

New or Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 

See the Notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Report for information concerning the implementation and impact of new or recently adopted accounting standards. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, goodwill, identifiable intangibles, contingent consideration liabilities and deferred income tax valuation allowances. We base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes to the accounting estimates that we have deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates are more fully described in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

There were no off-balance sheet arrangements during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our interests.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

This disclosure is not required for a smaller reporting company. 

Item 4. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act ). Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, as opposed to absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Accordingly, our management has designed the disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system were met. 

CEO/CFO Conclusions about the Effectiveness of the Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, inTEST management, including our CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Report, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis. The identified material weakness contributed to the restatements of our financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Management has determined that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting because we did not appropriately design and implement controls over the identification and the application of appropriate U.S. GAAP for transactions related to the procurement and sale of discontinued material/components purchased on behalf of customers where the associated materials/components were still physically located with us and the materials/components are expected to be applied to future product orders for these customers. 

This previously identified material weakness contributed to material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which have been corrected and restated in our Amendment No. 1 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2023. Accordingly, management has concluded that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. 

In addition, in the course of implementing the remediation plan described below, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ending June 30, 2024 associated with our recently acquired Alfamation subsidiary. This related to revenue recognition for Alfamation shipments at or near period-end with shipment terms where title does not transfer until delivery at our customers sites. 

Remediation Efforts 

As previously reported, over the course of the first half of the year, management began developing a remediation plan to address the previously identified material weakness discussed above. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we began implementing remediation steps as part of our plan to improve our internal control over financial reporting and to remediate the previously identified material weakness by adopting more rigorous period-end review processes for financial reporting and implementing additional transaction level controls. In addition, we have taken steps that we believe remediate the cause of the newly identified material weakness associated with our recently acquired Alfamation subsidiary as of September 30, 2024, and management is strengthening the internal accounting functions, where appropriate. 

-37-

Management has expanded and will continue to enhance our system of identifying transactions and evaluating and implementing the accounting standards that apply to our financial statements, including through enhanced analyses by our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. We intend to continue to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses described above and further continue re-assessing the design of controls, the testing of controls and modifying processes designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting. 

We will not be able to fully remediate the material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. The implementation of our remediation will be ongoing and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles. We may also conclude that additional measures may be required to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

As described above, we are in the process of implementing changes to our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weaknesses described herein. Other that these changes, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(e) Restrictions on Issuance of Shares of Common Stock .

4
