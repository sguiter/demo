Our Business 
 Churchill Downs Incorporated ("CDI" or the "Company") has been creating extraordinary entertainment experiences for over 150 years, beginning with the Company s most iconic and enduring asset, the Kentucky Derby. Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, CDI has expanded through the development of live and historical racing entertainment venues, the growth of the TwinSpires horse racing online wagering business, expanded pari-mutuel content and technology services to B2C platforms, and the operation and development of regional casino gaming properties. 
 We conduct our business through three reportable segments: Live and Historical Racing, TwinSpires, and Gaming. We aggregate our other businesses as well as certain corporate operations in All Other. 
 Key Indicators to Evaluate Business Results and Financial Condition 
 Our management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. These indicators include changes in net revenue, operating expense, operating income, earnings per share, outstanding debt balance, operating cash flow, and capital spend. 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We also use non-GAAP measures, including EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure of results of operations enables management and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period our operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner. Our chief operating decision maker utilizes Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance, develop strategy, and allocate resources. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our operating results. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the following: 
 Adjusted EBITDA includes our portion of EBITDA from our equity investments and the portion of EBITDA attributable to a noncontrolling interest. 
 Adjusted EBITDA excludes: 
 Transaction expense, net which includes: 
 Acquisition, disposition, and property sale related charges; 
 Other transaction expense, including legal, accounting and other deal-related expense; 
 Stock-based compensation expense; 
 Asset impairments; 
 Gain on property sales; 
 Legal reserves; 
 Pre-opening expense; and 
 Other charges, recoveries and expenses 
 As of December 31, 2021, our property in Arlington Heights, Illinois ("Arlington") ceased racing and simulcast operations and the property was sold on February 15, 2023 to the Chicago Bears. Arlington's results and exit costs in 2023 are treated as an adjustment to EBITDA . 
 On June 26, 2023, the Company's management agreement for Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin ("Lady Luck") in Farmington, Pennsylvania expired and was not renewed. The Company completed the sale of substantially all its assets at Lady Luck for an immaterial amount. 
 For segment reporting, Adjusted EBITDA includes intercompany revenue and expense totals that are eliminated in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. See the Reconciliation of Comprehensive Income to Adjusted EBITDA included in this section for additional information.

Governmental Regulations and Legislative Changes 
 We are subject to various federal, state, and international laws and regulations that affect our businesses. The ownership, operation, and management of our Live and Historical Racing, TwinSpires, and Gaming segments, as well as our other operations, are subject to regulation under the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The ownership, operation, and management of our businesses and properties are also subject to legislative actions at both the federal and state level. The following update on our regulatory and legislative actions should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including Part I - Item 1, "Business" for a discussion of regulatory and legislative changes. 
 Specific State Gaming Regulations 
 Louisiana 
 In Louisiana, the 2021 Historical Horse Racing Act (the "2021 HHR Act") allows off-track betting facilities ("OTBs") to have up to 50 HRMs. On October 25, 2022, a number of individual plaintiffs associated with video poker and truckstops, filed a lawsuit in the 19th Judicial District Court in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana against certain racetracks in Louisiana, including our Fair Grounds Racecourse and Slots property, alleging that the 2021 HHR Act is unconstitutional to the extent it purports to permit historical racing in a parish without a referendum. On June 8, 2023, plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on the constitutional issues raised in their complaint and a hearing was conducted on September 11, 2023. 
 On February 23, 2024, the judge issued a ruling in favor of plaintiffs granting summary judgment stating that: (i) historical horseracing is a new form of gaming not specifically authorized by law prior to 1996; (ii) historical horseracing may not be conducted in any parish of the state unless voters approve it through referendum; and (iii) the 2021 HHR Act that authorized historical horseracing is unconstitutional. The summary judgment, which was certified as final for purposes of appeal, was entered on March 18, 2024, and the Company, along with other interested parties including the Louisiana Racing Commission, filed a joint motion for a suspensive appeal, which was entered on March 26, 2024. The suspensive appeal allows the continued operation of HHR during the pendency of the appeal before the Louisiana Supreme Court. The case was lodged in the Louisiana Supreme Court on August 7, 2024 and the Company, and other appellants, including the Louisiana Attorney General on behalf of the Louisiana Racing Commission, filed opening briefs on October 9, 2024. The Company intends to vigorously defend the constitutionality of the HHR Act. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 500 HRMs in OTBs in Louisiana. If the 2021 HHR Act is determined to be unconstitutional it could have an adverse impact on our Louisiana HRM results which are reported in our Gaming segment.

 All Other Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.6 million driven primarily by increased corporate compensation related expenses and other corporate administrative expenses.

 Significant items affecting the comparability of our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets include: 
 Total assets increased 217.0 million driven by increased capital expenditures primarily at the Terre Haute Casino Resort, Churchill Downs Racetrack, Owensboro Racing and Gaming in Western Kentucky, and The Rose Gaming Resort in Virginia. 
 Total liabilities decreased 4.3 million driven primarily by decreased deferred revenue due to the recognition of revenue related to the 150th Kentucky Derby and the payment of dividends, partially offset by increased accounts payables. 
 FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 36 

Total equity increased 221.3 million driven by net income and the addition of a redeemable noncontrolling interest, partially offset by share repurchases. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following table is a summary of our liquidity and cash flows: 
 (in millions) Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Cash flows from: 2024 2023 Operating activities 641.1 498.8 142.3 Investing activities (415.8) (549.5) 133.7 Financing activities (216.7) 38.7 (255.4) 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities increased 142.3 million driven primarily a decrease in cash used for working capital and an increase in operating income, partially offset by increased interest paid and decreased distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates in 2024. We anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our credit facility over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations and capital expenditures. 
 Cash flows used in investing activities decreased 133.7 million primarily driven by decreased funds used in acquisitions and capital expenditures in 2024, partially offset by proceeds from the Arlington sale received in 2023. 
 Cash flows used in financing activities increased 255.4 million primarily driven by share repurchases in 2024 and decreased net proceeds from long-term debt in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 We have announced several project capital investments, including the following: Starting Gate Pavilion and Courtyard at Churchill Downs Racetrack, The Rose Gaming Resort in Northern Virginia, Owensboro Racing and Gaming in Western Kentucky, and a Calvert City HRM Venue in Southwestern Kentucky. We currently expect our project capital to be approximately 450.0 to 550.0 million in 2024, although this amount may vary significantly based on the timing of work completed, unanticipated delays, and timing of payments to third parties. 
 Common Stock Repurchase Program 
 On September 29, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a common stock repurchase program of up to 500.0 million (the "2021 Stock Repurchase Program"). The 2021 Stock Repurchase Program includes and is not in addition to the unspent amount remaining under the prior authorization. Repurchases may be made at management s discretion from time to time on the open market (either with or without a 10b5-1 plan) or through privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased 67,139 shares of the Company's common stock under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program for a total cost of approximately 9.0 million. We had approximately 170.9 million of repurchase authority remaining under this program on September 30, 2024, based on trade date. 
 On January 2, 2024, the Company closed on an agreement, dated December 18, 2023, with an affiliate of The Duchossois Group ("TDG") to repurchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, for 123.75 per share in a privately negotiated transaction for an aggregate purchase price of 123.8 million. This represented a discount of 4.03 to the closing price on December 15, 2023 of 128.95. The repurchase of shares of common stock from TDG was approved by the Company's Board of Directors separately from and did not reduce the authorized amount remaining under the existing common stock repurchase program. The repurchase of the shares was funded using available cash and borrowings under the Company s senior secured credit facility.

 Credit Agreement 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company s senior secured credit facility (as amended from time to time, the Credit Agreement") consisted of a 1.2 billion revolving credit facility (the "Revolver"), 289.5 million senior secured term loan B-1 (the "Term Loan B-1"), 1.2 billion senior secured term loan A (the "Term Loan A"), and 100.0 million swing line commitment. On July 3, 2024, the Company closed an amendment of the Credit Agreement to (i) extend the maturity date of the Revolver and Term Loan A from 2027 to 2029 and (ii) amend certain other provisions to the Credit Agreement. 
 Term Loan B-1 bears interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus 210 basis points and requires quarterly payments of 0.25 of the original 300.0 million balance. The Term Loan B-1 may be subject to additional mandatory prepayment from excess cash flow on an annual basis per the provisions of the Credit Agreement. 
 The Revolver and Term Loan A bear interest at SOFR plus 10 basis points, plus a variable applicable margin which is determined by the Company's net leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024, that applicable margin was 150 basis points which was based on the pricing grid in the Credit Agreement. The Company had 902.4 million available borrowing capacity, after consideration of 7.6 million in outstanding letters of credit, under the Revolver as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolver as determined by a pricing grid based on the consolidated total net secured leverage ratio of the Company. For the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company's commitment fee rate was 0.25 . 
 The estimated contractual payments, including interest, under the Credit Agreement for the next twelve months are estimated to be 178.5 million assuming no change in the weighted average borrowing rate of 6.5 , which was in place as of September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had repayments of principal and interest on the Credit Agreement of 858.2 million. 
 2027 Senior Notes 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500 senior unsecured notes that mature on April 1, 2027 (the "2027 Senior Notes"). The 2027 Senior Notes were issued at par in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, with interest payable in arrears on April 1st and October 1st of each year, commencing on October 1st, 2019. The Company may redeem some or all of the 2027 Senior Notes at redemption prices set forth in the 2027 Indenture. 
 2028 Senior Notes 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.750 senior unsecured notes (the 2028 Senior Notes maturing on January 15, 2028. The 2028 Senior Notes consist of 500.0 million notes issued at par and 200.0 million notes issued at 103.25 . The 2028 Senior Notes were issued in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, with interest payable in arrears on January 15th and July 15th of each year, commencing on July 15th, 2018. The 3.25 premium is being amortized through interest expense, net over the term of the notes. The Company may redeem some or all the 2028 Senior Notes at redemption prices set forth in the 2028 Indenture. 
 FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 38 

2030 Senior Notes 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.750 senior unsecured notes that mature on April 13, 2030 (the "2030 Senior Notes").

 2031 Senior Notes 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.750 senior unsecured notes that mature on April 25, 2031 (the "2031 Senior Notes"). The 2031 Senior Notes were issued at par in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, with interest payable in arrears on May 1st and November 1st of each year, commencing on November 1st, 2023. The Company may redeem some or all of the 2031 Senior Notes at any time prior to April 25, 2025, at redemption prices set forth in the 2031 Offering Memorandum. 
 
 Leases 
 The Company leases certain real estate and other property. Most of our building and land leases have terms of 2 to 10 years and include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from 1 to 5 years or more. Certain of our lease agreements include lease payments based on a percentage of net gaming revenue and others include rental payment adjustments periodically for inflation. As of September 30, 2024, minimum rent payable under operating leases was 26.9 million, with 6.0 million due in the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, minimum rent payable accounted for as financing obligations was 56.3 million, with 5.0 million due in the next twelve months. 
 Other Contractual Obligations 
 The Company has other contractual obligations with commitments of 12.4 million, 1.6 million of which is due within the next twelve months. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: 
 general economic trends; and 
 interest rate and credit risk. 
 General economic trends 
 Our business is sensitive to consumer confidence and reductions in consumers' discretionary spending, which may result from challenging economic conditions, inflation, unemployment levels and other changes in the economy. Demand for entertainment and leisure activities is sensitive to consumers disposable incomes, which can be adversely affected by economic conditions and unemployment levels. This could result in fewer patrons visiting our racetracks, HRM entertainment venues, online wagering sites, and gaming facilities, and/or may impact our customers ability to wager with the same frequency and to maintain wagering levels. 
 Interest rate and credit risk 
 Our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates. On September 30, 2024, we had 1.8 billion outstanding under our Credit Agreement, which bears interest at SOFR based variable rates. We are exposed to market risk on variable rate debt due to potential adverse changes in these rates. Assuming the outstanding balance of the debt facility remains constant, a one-percentage point increase in the SOFR rate would reduce net income and cash flows from operating activities by 12.9 million. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 As required by the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 13a-15(e), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the 
 FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 39 

effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our process for evaluating controls and procedures is continuous and encompasses constant improvement of the design and effectiveness of established controls and procedures.
