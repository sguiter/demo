 million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , revenue was million and million , respectively. Revenue is grouped into automotive sales revenue and automotive leasing revenue. 
 Automotive Sales Revenue 
 The Company began the production of its first vehicle, the FF 91 Futurist (the FF 91, FF 91 Futurist , or FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance ), in March 2023 and began delivering to customers in August 2023. 
 Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services including home charger, charger installation, 24/7 roadside assistance, over-the-air OTA software updates, internet connectivity and destination fees. 
 The Company recognizes revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business and as indicated in the sales contract. OTA software updates are provisioned upon transfer of control of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as the Company has a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. For obligations related to automotive sales, FF estimates standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the good or service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. The transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in proportion to the standalone selling price of the Company s performance obligations. Vehicle contracts do not contain a significant financing component. Automotive sales revenue was and million for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Revenue from promises to the customer that are considered immaterial are combined with the vehicle performance obligation and recognized when the product has been transferred. The Company accrues costs to transfer these immaterial goods and services regardless of whether they have been transferred.

 million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 The Company has entered into and may continue to enter into co-creator consulting agreements with its customers under which customers share feedback, driving data, ideas, and experiences with the Company s engineers, social media posts and other promotions in exchange for specified fees. The Company considers these arrangements consideration payable to a customer. The consideration paid to the customer relates to marketing and R D services that are distinct and could be purchased by the Company from a separate third party. The Company performs an analysis in which it maximizes the use of observable market inputs to ascribe a fair value to these services and record the fair value of these services to sales and marketing expense or R D expense, as applicable. Any consideration payable to a customer that is above the fair value of the distinct services being provided is treated as a reduction of revenue. 
 Automotive Leasing Revenue 
 Sales-Type Leasing Program 
 The Company has outstanding leases accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases ASC 842 ). Customers have the right to purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which is usually months. A customer qualifies under this program if the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised, and the Company therefore expects the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. The Company recognizes all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer when collectability of lease payments is probable at lease commencement. If collectability of lease payments is not probable at commencement, the Company recognizes the lease payments as deposit liability on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and does not derecognize the leased vehicle until such point that collectability of lease payments becomes probable. R evenue under this program was for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Operating Leasing Program 
 The Company has outstanding leases under its vehicle operating leasing program in the United States. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle for up to months. At the end of the lease term, customers are generally required to return the vehicle to the Company. The Company accounts for these leasing transactions as operating leases. The Company records leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and it records the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the revenue recorded under this program was . As of September 30, 2024, deferred lease-related upfront payments that will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases were immaterial. The Company s policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.

 million as of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. When vehicle purchase agreements are executed, the consideration for the vehicle and any accompanying products and services must be paid in advance prior to the transfer of products or services by the Company. Such advance payments are considered non-refundable, and the Company defers revenue related to any products or services that are not yet transferred.

Under applicable SEC rules and regulations, because FF failed to timely file its Form 10-K and the Quarterly Report Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company is not eligible to use the S-3 registration process, which restricts its ability to raise capital through that streamlined method of offering securities and cannot access the ATM Program. As such, the Company s current primary source of liquidity is the issuance of various convertible note instruments. 
 The Company s ability to issue and sell additional shares of common stock or warrants under the SEPA and ATM Program is constrained by the number of authorized shares of the Company s common stock. The Company must consider shares issuable under convertible debt, warrants or other obligations with equity rights. In addition, equity issuances can potentially trigger provisions under the SPA Commitments and Junior Secured SPA Notes that increase the number of shares to be issued upon conversion and reduce the strike price of related warrants. This could result in FF having inadequate authorized shares to meet its outstanding commitments. 
 The Company projects that it will require substantial additional funds to continue operations and support production of the FF 91. If the Company is unable to find additional sources of capital, the Company will not have sufficient resources to fund its outstanding obligations and continue operations and the Company will likely have to file for bankruptcy protection and its assets will likely be liquidated. The Company s equity holders would likely not receive any recovery at all in a bankruptcy scenario. 
 The Company continues to explore various funding and financing alternatives to fund its ongoing operations and to ramp up production. The particular funding and financing mechanisms, terms, timing, and amounts depend on the Company s assessment of opportunities available in the marketplace and the circumstances of the business at the relevant time. However, there have been delays in securing additional funding commitments, which have exacerbated supply chain pressures, among other things. If the Company s ongoing capital raising efforts are unsuccessful or significantly delayed, or if the Company experiences prolonged material adverse trends in its business, production will be delayed or decreased, and actual use of cash, production volume and revenue for 2024 will vary from the Company s previously disclosed forecasts, and such variances may be material. While the Company is actively engaged in negotiations with potential financing sources, it may be unable to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to it or at all. In addition to the risk that the Company s assumptions and analyses may

The Junior SPA Warrants could require cash settlement upon events that are considered outside of the control of the Company in a manner that is not consistent with the holders of the Company s Common Stock. The Company elected to measure the Junior SPA Warrants at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model, where the significant assumptions used include the volatility of the Company s Class A Common Stock, the Company s expectations around the full ratchet trigger, the contractual term of the Junior SPA Warrants, the risk-free rate and annual dividend yield. Fair value measurements associated with the liability-classified warrants represent Level 3 valuations under the fair value hierarchy. 
 Incremental Warrants 
 The Company s Incremental Warrants represent a derivative call obligation pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . As of September 30, 2024, the Company had Incremental Warrants outstanding that could be exercised for million in Junior Secured SPA Notes. The Incremental Warrants are exercisable solely at the option of the holder for a period of one year from issuance. The Company concluded that the fair value of the Incremental Warrant derivative obligation was de minimus at inception. The Company will monitor the performance of the Company s stock price and the fair value of the Junior Secured SPA Notes at each period to determine if the exercise price of the Junior Secured SPA Note par value is in-the-money. 
 Public and Private Warrants 
 Upon the closing of the Business Combination, the Company assumed Public Warrants and private warrants (the Private Warrants from PSAC. The Company also issued Private Warrants to settle related party notes of PSAC. The Public Warrants are indexed to the Company s own stock and, as such, meet the scope exception in accordance with ASC

 Fair value measurements associated with the Private Warrants liabilities represent Level 3 valuations under the fair value hierarchy. 
 Liabilities due to Insufficient Authorized Shares 
 From time to time, certain of the Company s equity-linked financial instruments may be classified as derivative liabilities under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , due to the Company having insufficient authorized shares to fully settle the equity-linked financial instruments in shares. See Note 11, Stockholders Equity .

 Overview 
 The Company is a California-based, global, shared, intelligent, mobility ecosystem company is a global, shared, intelligent, mobility ecosystem company with a vision to disrupt the automotive industry. The Company is a holding company incorporated in the State of Delaware on February 11, 2020, conducts its operations through the subsidiaries of FF Intelligent Mobility Global Holdings Ltd. Legacy FF ), which was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Our Class A Common Stock and Public Warrants trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq under the ticker symbols FFIE and FFIEW, respectively. 
 FF designs and engineers next-generation intelligent, connected, electric vehicles. We manufacture vehicles at our production facility in Hanford, California (the FF ieFactory California ). We have additional engineering, sales, and operational capabilities in China and are exploring opportunities for potential manufacturing capabilities in China through a joint venture or other arrangements. 
 Since our founding, we have created major innovations in technology, products, and a user-centered business model. We believe these innovations will enable us to set new standards in luxury and performance that will redefine the future of intelligent mobility. 
 We believe the following combination of capabilities of our products, technology, the upgrade to FF Product and Technology Upgrade Generation 2.0 (PT Gen 2.0), team, and business model distinguish us from our competitors: 
 We have designed and developed a breakthrough mobility platform our proprietary Variable Platform Architecture VPA ). 
 Our propulsion system provides a competitive edge in acceleration and range, enabled by an expected industry-leading inverter design, and propulsion system. 
 Our advanced Internet Artificial Intelligence I.A.I. technology offers high-performance computing, high speed internet connectivity, Over-the-Air OTA updating, an open ecosystem for third-party application integration, and an advanced autonomous driving-ready system, in addition to several other proprietary innovations that enable us to build an advanced, highly-personalized user experience. 
 Since inception, we have developed a portfolio of intellectual property, established our supply chain, and assembled a global team of automotive and technology experts and innovators to achieve our goal of redefining the future of the automotive industry. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 660 active patents globally. 
 We believe that the FF 91 Futurist (the FF 91, FF 91 Futurist, or FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance is the first ultra-luxury electric vehicle to offer a highly-personalized, fully-connected user experience for driver and passengers. We started production on the first FF 91 Futurist and delivered the first FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance in 2023. 
 Our planned B2C passenger vehicle pipeline includes the FF91 series, the FF81 series, and the FF71 series. 
 Subject to future financing, we plan to produce and deliver our second passenger vehicle, the FF 81, which is expected to be designed to be a premium, mass-market electric vehicle positioned to compete against the Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X, the BMW 5-series, the Range Rover Sport and similar vehicles. 
 Subject to future financing, we plan to develop a mass-market passenger vehicle, the FF 71. We expect to start production and deliveries of the FF 71 subsequent to production and deliveries of the FF 81. The FF 71 is expected to be designed to integrate full connectivity and advanced technology into a smaller vehicle size and is positioned to compete with vehicles such as the Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model Y, and the BMW 3-series. 
 Subject to future financing, we plan to develop a Smart Last Mile Delivery SLMD vehicle to address the high-growth, last-mile delivery opportunity, particularly in Europe, China and the U.S. Our modular VPA facilitates entry into the last-mile delivery segment, allowing us to expand our total addressable market and avenues of growth. 
 56 

We have updated our corporate strategy to include a China-U.S. Automotive Bridge Strategy (the Bridge Strategy ). The Bridge Strategy marks a return to our earlier two-brand strategy, which seeks to distinguish between the spire segment (FF brand) and mass market segment (second brand) of the EV industry. We intend to seek to establish a second mass market-focused brand by working with one or more China-based OEMs and parts suppliers Bridge Strategy Partners and to procure quasi-complete components and parts that we would enhance by adding AI and Vehicle Software technology and product R D found in our flagship FF 91 brand. This could create a compelling value proposition to consumers in the AI EV mass-market, which is a market that currently has limited offerings. Via the Bridge Strategy, there is the potential to materially accelerate the production timeline for a mass-market AI EV. While the mechanical platform of the mass-market product would be from Bridge Strategy Partners, we intend to seek to utilize a component mix sufficient to reach part level duty by fulfilling the criteria for part supplier and manufacturing requirement. For a discussion of material risks relating to the Bridge Strategy, please see Part II, Item 1A., Risk Factors Our latest business strategy, which we refer to as the Bridge Strategy, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in t he Q1 2024 10-Q. 
 All FF vehicles are expected to be available for sale in the U.S., China and the Middle East, with potential expansion to European markets. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can choose not to take advantage of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies. Any such election to not take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. 
 We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act and have elected to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period for new or revised financial accounting standards. We expect to continue to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period, although we may decide to early adopt such new or revised accounting standards to the extent permitted by such standards. This may make it difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
 
 Segment Information 
 On February 26, 2023, after an assessment by the Board of Directors (the Board of the Company s management structure, the Board approved our Chief Product and User Ecosystem Officer (Mr. Yueting Jia, who is also FF s founder) reporting directly to the Board. In addition, the Board approved our product, mobility ecosystem, I.A.I., and advanced research and development R D technology departments reporting directly to the Chief Product and User Ecosystem Officer. The Board also approved our user ecosystem, capital markets, human resources and administration, corporate strategy and China departments reporting to both the Chief Product and User Ecosystem Officer and the Global Chief Executive Officer, subject to processes and controls to be determined by the Board after consultation with our management. Based on his responsibilities within the Company, the Board determined that Mr. Jia is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and an executive officer of the Company under Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act. 
 
 We have determined that our co-Chief Operating Decision Makers co-CODMs are both our Global CEO and our Chief Product and User Ecosystem Officer. We have determined that we operate in one operating segment and one reportable segment, as the co-CODMs review financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. Substantially all of our consolidated operating activities, including our long-lived assets, are located within the United States. Given our early-revenue operating stage, we currently have no concentration exposure to products, services or customers.

 Components of FF s Results of Operations 
 Key Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 Our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities but also pose risks and challenges including those discussed below and in the section titled Risk Factors in the December 31, 2023 Form 10-K and March 31, 2024 Form 10-Q. 
 Production and Operations 
 We expect to continue to incur significant operating costs that will impact our future profitability, including R D expenses as we introduce new models and improve existing models; capital expenditures for the expansion of our manufacturing capacities; additional operating costs and expenses for production ramp-up; raw material procurement costs; general and administrative expenses as we scale our operations; interest expense from debt financing activities; and selling and distribution expenses as we build our brand and market our vehicles. We may incur significant costs in connection with our services as we deliver at scale the FF 91 Futurist, including servicing and warranty costs. Our ability to become profitable in the future will depend on our ability to successfully market our vehicles and control our costs. 
 Through September 30, 2024, we have sold a t otal of five and leased nine vehicles. As a result, we will require substantial additional capital to develop products and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Until we can generate sufficient revenue from product sales, we will fund our ongoing operations through a combination of various funding and financing alternatives, including equipment financing of the FF ieFactory California, secured syndicated debt financing, convertible notes, working capital loans, and equity offerings, among other options. The particular funding mechanisms, terms, timing, and amounts are dependent on our assessment of opportunities available in the marketplace and the circumstances of the business at the relevant time. Any delays in the successful completion of our FF ieFactory California will impact our ability to generate revenue. For additional discussion of the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, see Note 2, 
 59 

Liquidity and Capital Resources and Going Concern in the notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and for further details on liquidity, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We began the production of our FF 91 Futurist in March 2023 and started making deliveries to customers in August 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any vehicles and leased out two vehicles. 
 Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services including home charger, charger installation, 24/7 roadside assistance, Over-The-Air OTA software updates, internet connectivity and destination fees. 
 We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business and as indicated in the sales contract. OTA software updates are provisioned upon transfer of control of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. For obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the good or service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. The transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in proportion to the standalone selling price of our performance obligations. Vehicle contracts do not contain a significant financing component. 
 Revenue from promises to the customer that are considered immaterial are combined with the vehicle performance obligation and recognized when the product has been transferred. We accrue costs to transfer these immaterial goods and services regardless of whether they have been transferred. 
 We provide customers with a residual value guarantee which may or may not be exercised in the future. 
 Co-creation Arrangements 
 As part of our Futurist Product Officers FPO Co-Creation Delivery program that began in August 2023, we have entered into co-creation agreements with certain customers. The arrangement leverages some of our sales and leasing customers to provide valuable driving data, insights, marketing and brand awareness of the FF 91 vehicle. For the services performed, we compensate the respective customers through a monthly consulting fee payment or a discount on their monthly lease payment. Management examined in detail the services provided by each respective customer in accordance with the co-creation agreement, established various data points, and rationally assigned a dollar amount that was deemed representative of the fair value of the services. Co-creation payments that exceed the fair value of the distinct services performed by the customer are considered consideration paid to the customer and were treated as a reduction in revenue. 
 We have entered into and may continue to enter into co-creator consulting agreements with our customers under which customers share feedback, driving data, ideas, and experiences with our engineers, social media posts and other promotions in exchange for specified fees. We consider these arrangements consideration payable to a customer. The consideration paid to the customer relates to marketing and R D services that are distinct and could be purchased by us from a separate third party. We perform an analysis in which we maximize the use of observable market inputs to ascribe a fair value to these services and record the fair value of these services to sales and marketing expense or R D expense, as applicable. Any consideration payable to a customer that is above the fair value of the distinct services being provided is treated as a reduction of revenue. 
 Automotive Leasing Revenue 
 Operating Leasing Program 
 We have outstanding leases under our vehicle operating leasing program in the United States. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle for up to 36 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are generally required to return the vehicles to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. 
 Sales-Type Leasing Program 
 We have outstanding leases accounted for as sales-type leases under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 842, Leases ASC 842 ). Customers have the right to purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which is usually 36 months. A customer qualifies under this program if the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised, and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, 
 60 

respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer when collectability of lease payments is probable at lease commencement. If collectability of lease payments is not probable at commencement, we recognize the lease payments as deposit liability and do not derecognize the leased vehicle until such point that collectability of lease payments becomes probable. 
 Customer Deposits and Deferred Revenue 
 Our customers may reserve a vehicle and preorder certain services by making a customer deposit, which is fully refundable at any time. Refundable deposits, for vehicle reservations and services, received from customers prior to an executed vehicle purchase agreement are recorded as customer deposits within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 When vehicle purchase agreements are executed, the consideration for the vehicle and any accompanying products and services must be paid in advance prior to the transfer of products or services by us. Such advance payments are considered non-refundable, and we defer revenue related to any products or services that are not yet transferred. 
 Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. 
 Warranties 
 We provide a manufacturer s warranty on all vehicles sold. The warranty covers the rectification of reported defects via repair, replacement, or adjustment of faulty parts or components. The warranty does not cover any item where failure is due to normal wear and tear. This assurance-type warranty does not create a performance obligation separate from the vehicle. Management tracks warranty claims by vehicle ID, owner, and date. As we continue to manufacture and sell more vehicles, we will reassess and evaluate our warranty claims for purposes of our warranty accrual. 
 Cost of Automotive Sales Revenue 
 Cost of revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense. 
 Cost of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts and material. 
 Cost of Automotive Leasing Program 
 Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and Development R D activities represent a significant part of our business. Our R D efforts focus on the design and development of our electric vehicles and continuing to prepare our prototype electric vehicles to exceed industry standards for compliance, innovation, and performance. R D expenses consist of personnel-related costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation) for our employees focused on R D activities, other related costs, depreciation, R D services provided by co-creators, and an allocation of overhead. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation) for our employees focused on sales and marketing, costs associated with sales and marketing activities, marketing services provided by co-creators, and an allocation of overhead.

 The change in fair value during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is smaller compared to the same period in 2023 due to a decline in the outstanding balance of related party notes payable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with an increase in the outstanding balance of related party notes payable during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loss on Settlement of Notes Payable 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (in thousands) 2024 2023 Amount Loss on settlement of notes payable (117,509) (204,885) 87,376 (43) 
 The decrease in the loss on settlement of notes payable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by smaller losses on extinguishment resulting from the modification of our notes payable accounted for as an extinguishment pursuant to the guidance in ASC 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments , and a lower conversion volume during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of 2.7 million as a result of entering into the Waiver Agreement, and noteholders converted 96.3 million of notes payable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of 11.4 million as a result of the Eighth Secured SPA Amendment, and noteholders converted 200.4 million of notes payable. 
 Loss on Related Party Notes Payable Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (in thousands) 2024 2023 Amount Loss on related party notes payable (14,295) (17,248) 2,953 (17) 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related party noteholders converted 0.7 million of related party notes payable into 1,324,292 shares of our Class A Common Stock, and we recognized a loss on settlement of related party notes payable for the difference between the fair value of the shares issued and the fair value of the debt instrument. In addition, as discussed in Note 8, Related Party Transactions in the notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , we also recognized a 14.1 million loss on related party notes from the recognition of interest and penalties and the increase of 
 71 

principal due to our breach of the agreement with Chongqing Leshi Small Loan Co., Ltd. There was no comparable related party loss in the comparable prior year period. 
 In May 2023, we entered into Unsecured SPA Notes with Metaverse Horizon Limited MHL ), who is a related party, and V W Investment Holding Limited V W Investment . During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, MHL converted Unsecured SPA Notes with an aggregate principal balance of 18.7 million into 602,947 shares of Class A Common Stock, and we recognized a loss on settlement of related party notes payable for the difference between the fair value of the shares issued and the fair value of the debt instrument. 
 Interest Expense Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (in thousands) 2024 2023 Amount Interest expense (5,386) (591) (4,795) (811) 
 Interest expense increased by 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 c ompared to the same period in 2023. This increase was p rimarily due to financial obligations associated with the Hanford, California manufacturing facility. We pursued a sale-leaseback arrangement for this facility to generate liquidity for operational and facility enhancements. However, due to conditions within the sale-leaseback agreement, the transaction was treated as a financing arrangement under GAAP, resulting in interest expense rather than lease expense. This arrangement did not exist during the same period in 2023. 
 Related Party Interest Expense Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (in thousands) 2024 2023 Amount Related party interest expense (7,812) (139) (7,673) 5520 
 Related party interest expense increased by 7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 c ompared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to interest expense due to our loan with Chongqing, a related party. This increase was primarily due to our default on the related party note with Chongqing, in the first quarter of 2024, which triggered an increase in the interest rate as well as additional interest expense and penalties. Since the default, we continue to accrue all relevant interest and penalties. 
 Other/(Expense) Income, Net Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (in thousands) 2024 2023 Amount Other income/(expense), net 599 (1,922) 2,521 (131) 
 Other income was 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to Other expense of 1.9 million for the same period in 2023. The 0.6 million of Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the 1.9 million of Other expense for the same period in 2023 were primarily attributable to the revaluation of foreign currency transactions denominated in non-U.S. currencies assessed at the end of each period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the U.S. dollar exchange rate to the Chinese currency CNY declined, resulting in a foreign currency transaction gain from the revaluation of foreign currency transactions, which was recorded as Other income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the U.S. dollar exchange rate to the Chinese currency CNY climbed up, resulting in a foreign currency transaction loss from the revaluation of foreign currency transactions, which was recorded as Other expense. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Going Concern 
 We have evaluated whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are issued. Based on our recurring losses from operations since inception and continued cash outflows from operating activities (all as described below), we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date that the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q were issued. 
 The Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Accordingly, the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on 
 72 

a basis that assumes we will continue as a going concern and that contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 
 We have and will continue to devote substantial effort and, to the extent available, capital resources, to strategic planning, engineering, design, and development of our electric vehicle platform, development of vehicle models, finalizing the build out of the FF ieFactory California manufacturing facility, and capital raising. We incurred cumulative losses from operations, negative cash flows from operating activities, and have an accumulated deficit of 4,193.1 million, an unrestricted cash balance of 7.3 million and a negative working capital position of 168.3 million, excluding restricted cash, as of September 30, 2024. During 2023, we delivered our first vehicles but expect to continue generating significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. We have funded our operations and capital needs primarily through the issuance of related party notes payable and notes payable (see Note 7, Notes Payable and Note 8, Related Party Transactions in the notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), convertible notes, and the sale of common stock. 
 Pursuant to the Secured SPA, the Unsecured SPA, the Unsecured Streeterville SPA, the FFVV Joinder, and the Senyun Joinder (collectively the SPA Commitments (see Note 7, Notes Payable and Note 8, Related Party Transactions in the notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), we obtained commitments from several investors. As of September 30, 2024, the SPA Commitments totaled 554.5 million, of which 365.3 million was funded, 189.2 million remained to be funded, and 38.7 million in principal was outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, Optional Commitments under the SPA Commitments totaled 366.0 million, of which 48.4 million was funded, 317.6 million remained to be funded, and 10.4 million was outstanding. The remaining amounts to be funded as of September 30, 2024, are subject to the achievement of delivery milestones, satisfaction of closing conditions, and satisfaction or waiver of other conditions. 
 We may be unable to satisfy the closing conditions under the SPA Commitments or obtain additional incremental convertible senior secured note purchasers under the SPA Commitments or other debt or equity financing in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. 
 On September 5, 2024, we entered into another Securities Purchase Agreement (the Junior Secured SPA with certain institutional investors as purchasers (the Junior Secured SPA Investors ). Pursuant to the Junior Secured SPA, the Junior Secured SPA Investors agreed to purchase certain secured promissory notes (the Junior Secured SPA Notes ), warrants, and incremental warrants for approximately 30.0 million, of which 22.5 million was paid in cash and approximately 7.5 million was converted from a previous loan to us, in two closings. As of September 30, 2024, we received 20.8 million of the commitments and the remaining commitments were received by October 30, 2024. Additionally, the Junior Secured SPA Investors were given an incremental warrant to purchase additional Junior Secured SPA commitments, up to amounts originally funded (the Incremental Warrants ), at the same terms and conditions as the original Junior Secured SPA Notes. The Incremental Warrants are exercisable immediately, entirely at the option of the holder, with a term of one year to purchase the additional Junior Secured SPA Notes at an exercise price equal to the principal amount of the Junior Secured SPA Notes issued to the Junior Secured SPA Investor. 
 On November 11, 2022, we entered into a three-year Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the SEPA with YA II PN Ltd. Yorkville ). Under terms of the SEPA, we may, at our option, issue and sell from time to time up to 200.0 million (which can be increased up to 350.0 million in the aggregate under our option) of Class A Common Stock to an affiliate of Yorkville Advisors, subject to certain limitations. As of September 30, 2024, we had the right to issue and sell up to an additional 192.5 million, or 342.5 million if we exercise our option under the SEPA, of Class A Common Stock under the SEPA. 
 In addition, on September 26, 2023, we entered into a sales agreement with Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated, B. Riley Securities, Inc., A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, Wedbush Securities Inc. and Maxim Group LLC, as sales agents, to sell shares of Class A Common Stock, from time to time, with aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to 90.0 million pursuant to the Registration Statement as an at-the-market offering under the Securities Act (the ATM Program ). The ATM Program was the primary source of liquidity for us during the period from September 2023 through December 2023. Under applicable SEC rules and regulations, because we failed to timely file our Form 10-K and the Quarterly Report Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we are not eligible to use the S-3 registration process, which restricts our ability to raise capital through that streamlined method of offering securities and cannot access the ATM Program. As such, our current primary source of liquidity is the issuance of various convertible note instruments. 
 Our ability to issue and sell additional shares of common stock or warrants under the SEPA and ATM Program is constrained by the number of authorized shares of our common stock. We must consider shares issuable under convertible debt, warrants or other obligations with equity rights. In addition, equity issuances can potentially trigger provisions under the SPA Commitments and Junior Secured SPA Notes that increase the number of shares to be issued upon conversion and reduce the strike price of related warrants. This could result in us having inadequate authorized shares to meet our outstanding commitments. 
 73 

We project that we will require substantial additional funds to continue operations and support production of the FF 91. If we are unable to find additional sources of capital, we will not have sufficient resources to fund our outstanding obligations and continue operations and we will likely have to file for bankruptcy protection and our assets will likely be liquidated. Our equity holders would likely not receive any recovery at all in a bankruptcy scenario. 
 We continue to explore various funding and financing alternatives to fund our ongoing operations and to ramp up production. The particular funding and financing mechanisms, terms, timing, and amounts depend on our assessment of opportunities available in the marketplace and the circumstances of the business at the relevant time. However, there have been delays in securing additional funding commitments, which have exacerbated supply chain pressures, among other things. If our ongoing capital raising efforts are unsuccessful or significantly delayed, or if we experience prolonged material adverse trends in our business, production will be delayed or decreased, and actual use of cash, production volume and revenue for 2024 will vary from our previously disclosed forecasts, and such variances may be material. While we are actively engaged in negotiations with potential financing sources, we may be unable to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition to the risk that our assumptions and analyses may prove incorrect, the projections may underestimate the professional fees and other costs to be incurred related to the pursuit of various financing options currently being considered and ongoing legal risks. Capital needs to fund development of our remaining product portfolio will highly depend on the market success and profitability of the FF 91 and our ability to accurately estimate and control costs. Apart from the FF 91 series, substantial additional capital would be required to fund operations, research, development, and design efforts for future vehicles. 
 Since April 2023, we have been in default on, and since January 1, 2024, we have been in breach of, our debt agreement with Chongqing Leshi Small Loan Co., Ltd., a related party, with an outstanding principal balance of 7.7 million and interest payable of 20.0 million as of September 30, 2024. During 2024, we were also in default on our Unsecured Convertible Note obligations and various related party notes (see Note 7, Notes Payable and Note 8, Related Party Transactions in the notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Due to the cross default provisions of the SPA Notes and Junior Secured SPA Notes, we were and have been in default on the SPA and Junior Secured Commitments and we are presenting the related notes as current. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we maintained unrestricted cash on hand totaling 7.3 million, which was held for working capital and general corporate purposes. We also have access to various sources of additional capital, including the SEPA, the ATM Program, the Secured SPA, the Unsecured SPA, the Unsecured Streeterville SPA, the FFVV Joinder, and the Senyun Joinder (collectively the SPA Commitments ), the Junior Secured SPA and other unsecured convertible notes. Our current primary source of liquidity is the issuance of various convertible note instruments pursuant to the SPA Commitments and the Junior Secured SPA. Our ability to access these sources of capital and further information on amounts available is discussed in Note 2, Liquidity and Capital Resources and Going Concern in the notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Significant Related Party Notes Payable and Notes Payable Facilities 
 We have been significantly funded by notes payable from related parties and third parties. The related parties include employees as well as affiliates of employees and affiliates and other companies controlled or previously controlled by our founder and Chief Product and User Ecosystem Officer.

 Cash Flow Analysis 
 Presented below is a summary of FF s cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 (in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (51,796) (240,370) Investing activities (572) (10,846) Financing activities 55,685 237,565 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and restricted cash 7 3,704 
 75 

Operating Activities 
 We continue to experience negative cash flows from operating activities as we design and develop our vehicles and build our infrastructure in both the United States and China. Cash flows from operating activities are significantly impacted by our capital investments to support business growth, particularly in enhancing the production capabilities of our electric vehicles, corporate planning, and general and administrative functions. Additionally, our operating cash flows are influenced by working capital requirements to support growth, as well as fluctuations in personnel-related expenses, accounts payable, accrued interest, other current liabilities, deposits, and other current assets. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 51.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 240.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an improvement of 188.6 million . This improvement was primarily driven by a 113.4 million reduction in net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period. 
 Significant non-cash adjustments to net loss included a 61.5 million decrease in fair value adjustments on notes payable and warrant liabilities and a 25.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization. These were partially offset by an 87.4 million decrease in losses on the settlement of notes payable and a 14.9 million gain from the settlement of previously accrued R D expenses. 
 Changes in operating assets and liabilities also significantly impacted cash flows from operating activities. Key contributors included a 37.7 million change in inventory balances, a 26.9 million change in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a 20.4 million change in deposits, and a 11.0 million change in other current and non-current assets, partially offset by a 15.6 million change in accounts payable. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 0.6 million and 10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of 10.3 million . This change was driven by a significant decrease in the acquisition of fixed assets due to the reduction of liquidity. 
 Financing Activities 
 Given the challenging financing landscape, we continue to pursue strategic opportunities to strengthen our cash position and support our growth objectives, primarily utilizing a mix of convertible loans and non-convertible funding alternatives. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 55.7 million and 237.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting a decrease of 181.9 million. Proceeds from notes payable in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 54.0 million, down from 208.7 million in the same period in 2023, a reduction of 154.6 million. Proceeds from related-party notes payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.1 million, down from 19.8 million in the same period in 2023, a reduction of 16.7 million. Furthermore, cash generated from common stock sales decreased by 8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash and Restricted Cash 
 The effects of exchange rate changes on cash and restricted cash was immaterial for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effects of exchange rate changes on cash and restricted cash result from fluctuations in the translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, primarily Chinese currency CNY . Fluctuations in exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar may positively or negatively affect our operating results. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Thus, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 76 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Management has based its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
 Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected. Given the global economic climate, estimates are subject to additional volatility. 
 Critical accounting estimates are defined as estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. For a description of our critical accounting estimates, refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, set forth in Part II, Item 7, of the Form 10-K. As of the date of this report, there have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates described in the Form 10-K that have had a material impact on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See the section titled Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1, Nature of Business and Organization and Basis of Presentation in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for a discussion about recent accounting pronouncements that are determined to be applicable to us. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, FF is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 FF s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that FF files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including its Global Chief Executive Officer and its Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based on an evaluation of FF s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), FF s Global Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer (its principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, respectively) have concluded that FF s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 FF s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including FF s Global CEO and Interim Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, due to the material weaknesses described below, we concluded that the system of internal control over financial reporting was not effective. 
 FF identified material weaknesses in FF s internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of its annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses are as follows: 
 77 

FF did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with its financial reporting requirements. Specifically, FF lacked a sufficient number of professionals with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately. Additionally, management did not establish formal reporting lines in pursuit of its objectives. Further, the lack of a sufficient number of professionals resulted in an inability to consistently establish appropriate authorities and responsibilities in pursuit of its financial reporting objectives, as demonstrated by, among other things, insufficient segregation of duties in its finance and accounting functions. 
 FF did not design and maintain effective controls in response to the risks of material misstatement. Specifically, changes to existing controls or the implementation of new controls were not sufficient to respond to changes to the risks of material misstatement to financial reporting, due to growth in the business. 
 FF did not design and maintain effective controls for communicating and sharing information between the legal, capital markets, and accounting and finance departments. Specifically, the accounting and finance departments were not consistently provided the complete and adequate support, documentation, and information including the nature of relationships with certain counterparties to record transactions within the financial statements timely, completely and accurately. 
 FF did not design and maintain effective controls to address the identification of and accounting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions, including the proper application of generally accepted accounting principles to such transactions. Specifically, FF did not design and maintain controls to timely identify and account for convertible notes under the fair value option, warrant liabilities, embedded derivatives related to convertible notes, impute interest on related party notes payable with interest rates below market rates, account for failed sale leaseback transactions, and account for warrant instruments. 
 FF did not design and maintain formal accounting policies, procedures and controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including controls over the period-end financial reporting process addressing areas including financial statement and footnote presentation and disclosures, account reconciliations and journal entries, including segregation of duties, assessing the reliability of reports and spreadsheets used in controls, and the timely identification and accounting for cut-off of expenditures. 
 FF did not design and maintain effective controls over information technology IT general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of its financial statements, specifically, with respect to (i) program change management controls to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately; (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and that adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs, and data to appropriate company personnel; and (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that critical batch jobs are monitored and data backups are authorized and monitored. These IT deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements, however, the deficiencies, when aggregated, could result in material misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures. 
 FF did not maintain an effective control environment or demonstrate a commitment to maintain integrity and ethical values. Specifically, members management failed to reinforce the need for compliance and internal control awareness with certain of FF s governance, accounting and finance policies and procedures. This resulted in inaccurate and incomplete disclosures of certain relationships, arrangements, and transactions. 
 FF did not design and maintain effective controls related to the identification and disclosure of certain arrangements and transactions with related parties. 
 Each of the material weaknesses described above could result in a material misstatement to substantially all of the Company s accounts or disclosures. 
 Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is actively engaged and committed to taking the steps necessary to remediate the control deficiencies that constituted the material weaknesses. Since identifying the material weaknesses described above, FF made the following enhancements to the Company s internal control over financial reporting: 
 FF has added and will continue to add finance and accounting personnel to the organization to strengthen our finance and accounting teams. The additional personnel are expected to provide oversight, structure, reporting lines, and additional review over the Company s disclosures; 
 78 

FF has implemented and will continue to develop new accounting policies and procedures, and the Company has installed and continues to configure an IT system relevant to the preparation of the Company s financial statements to improve communication of key areas across the different departments at FF and to provide adequate structure, accountability, and segregation of duties; 
 FF has implemented and will continue to develop enhanced controls around FF s related party transactions, including regular attestations; and 
 FF adopted an Insider Investment Reporting Policy to enhance internal reporting of related party transactions. 
 Our remediation activities are continuing during 2024. There have been substantial changes to the composition of the Board as a result of the governance settlement entered into between FF and FF Global, as well as substantial turnover in key management personnel, including accounting, legal and compliance personnel, which could impact our ability to implement the above-described remedial measures. In addition, the Company has engaged various advisory firms to provide consulting services to assist in improving the internal control environment and reviewing the corporate organization on a go-forward basis. 
 In addition, as of September 30, 2024, certain departments within the Company report to both Mr. Jia (our founder and Chief Product and User Ecosystem Officer) and Mr. Aydt (our Global Chief Executive Officer), including the Company s user ecosystem, capital markets, human resources and administration, and FF China FFCN ), subject to processes and controls that have been determined and continue to be developed by the Board after consultation with the Company s management. Further, the Board determined that Mr. Jia is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and an executive officer of the Company under Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act. FF has or is planning to put in place processes and controls to mitigate the risks associated with the changes in Mr. Jia s responsibilities as well as to enhance oversight and corporate governance, including but not limited to: 
 Continuing to mon itor the segregation of responsibilities and duties in the Company s user ecosystem, capital markets, human resources and administration, and FFCN; 
 Requiring the Board, or a designated committee of the Board, to approve the signing of financing agreements, the hiring, promotion or termination of vice presidents of the Company and above (including additional Section 16 officers), and the adoption of Company-wide compensation policies; 
 While the Company has hired a Compliance Officer with the title of a Deputy General Counsel to support its compliance efforts (hired in March 2023), it will continue to review the need to employ a Chief Compliance Officer who will report on a dotted line to the Chair of the Audit Committee; and 
 Re-engaging external consulting resources review compliance activities and perform work in the capacity of an internal audit function, who will report on a dotted line to the Chair of the Audit Committee. 
 In addition to the above actions and in view of the governance changes that the Company implemented pursuant to the Heads of Agreement and Amended Shareholder Agreement (each as described in Part III, Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, in the Form 10-K) and otherwise, FF expects to engage in additional activities, including, but not limited to: 
 Continuing to hire key finance and accounting personnel as FF scales and until FF has sufficient technical accounting resources, combined with engaging external consultants to provide support and to assist in the evaluation of more complex applications of generally accepted accounting principles and to assist with documenting and assessing our accounting policies and procedures; 
 Designing and implementing controls in response to the risks of material misstatement to identify and evaluate changes in FF s business and the impact on internal controls; 
 Designing and implementing controls for communicating and sharing information between legal, capital markets, and accounting to facilitate transactions being recorded timely and accurately; 
 Designing and implementing formal processes, accounting policies, procedures, and controls supporting certain business processes and our financial close process, including creating standard balance sheet reconciliation templates and journal entry controls assessing the reliability of reports and spreadsheets used in controls; and the timely identification and accounting for cut-off of expenditures; 
 Designing and implementing controls to address the identification of and accounting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions; 
 79 

Designing and implementing controls related to the identification and disclosure of certain arrangements and transactions with related parties; 
 Continuing to implement additional IT systems relevant to the preparation of FF s financial statements and controls over financial reporting to improve communication of key areas across the different departments at the Company and to provide adequate structure, accountability, and segregation of duties; and 
 Designing and implementing IT general controls, including controls over change management, the review and update of user access controls and controls over critical batch jobs and data backups. 
 While FF has made progress, the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the Company completes the design and implementation of the enhanced controls, the controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and FF has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. FF believes that the remediation plan will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weakness and strengthen internal control over financial reporting. 
 As the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve internal control over financial reporting, FF may determine that additional measures or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary. 
 FF is working to remediate the material weaknesses as efficiently and effectively as possible and expects full remediation could potentially go beyond December 31, 2024. At this time, the Company cannot provide an estimate of costs expected to be incurred in connection with implemen ting this remediation plan; however, these remediation measures will be time consuming, will result in FF incurring significant costs, and will place significant demands on the Company s financial and operational resources. 
 While FF believes these efforts will remediate the material weaknesses, the Company may not be able to complete its evaluation, testing or any required remediation in a timely fashion, or at all. FF cannot assure that the measures that have been taken to date and may be taken in the future will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. The effectiveness of FF s internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the possibility of human error and the risk of fraud. Further loss and/or turnover in key management personnel, particularly accounting, finance and legal personnel, may negatively impact FF s ability to implement its remediation plan. If FF is unable to remediate its material weaknesses, FF s ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the forms of the SEC, could be adversely affected which, in turn, may adversely affect the Company s reputation and business and the market price of the Class A Common Stock. Any such failures could result in litigation or regulatory actions by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, loss of investor confidence, delisting of FF s securities and harm to FF s reputation and financial condition, or diversion of financial and management resources from the operation of FF s business. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, FF s internal control over financial reporting.

 Subject to Palantir s receipt of each of the Settlement Fees in full in accordance with Sections 1.1(a) and 1.1(b), Order Form #1 and the MSA shall be deemed terminated by the Parties effective as of, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the date that all of the Settlement Fees are paid in full by Faraday Termination Date ). Effective as of the Termination Date, neither Party shall have any further rights or obligations under Order Form #1 and the MSA, except for any obligations which explicitly survive termination as set forth in Order Form #1 or the MSA.
