Total revenue 

Contract Balances Contract balances represent amounts presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets when either the Company has transferred goods or services to the customer, or the customer has paid consideration to the Company under the contract. These contract balances include trade accounts receivable and deferred revenue. Deferred revenue represents consideration received from customers at the beginning of the subscription period for services that are transferred to the customer over the respective subscription period. The accounts receivable balances represent amounts billed to customers for goods and services where the Company has an unconditional right to payment of the amount billed.

 days of invoice and up to less than based on the terms agreed upon with the respective customer. Accounts Receivable, Unbilled Services, and Deferred Revenue Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value. Unbilled receivables arise when performance obligations are satisfied for which revenue has been recognized but the customers have not been billed. Contractual provisions and payment schedules may or may not correspond to the timing of the performance of services under the contract. Deferred revenue is a contract liability that consists of customer payments received in advance of performance and billings in excess of revenue recognized, net of revenue recognized from the balance at the beginning of the period. The amount of revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period was and , respectively. The amount of revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period was and , respectively. Timing of Billing and Performance Difference in the timing of revenue recognition and associated billings and cash collections result in recording of billed accounts receivable, unbilled accounts receivable (including contract assets), and deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts are billed in accordance with the agreed-upon contractual terms, resulting in recording unbilled accounts receivable in instances where the right to bill is contingent solely on the passage of time, and contract assets in instances where the right to consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Revenue from Leasing Arrangements Revenue from leasing arrangements is not subject to the revenue standard for contracts with customers and remains separately accounted for under ASC 842, including leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company recorded service revenue from lease arrangements of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recorded service revenue from lease arrangements of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company records revenue from the sale of hardware devices under sales-type leases as device revenue in an amount equal to the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease. Sales-type leases also produce financing income, which is included in device revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and is recognized at effective rates of return over the lease term. Costs of Obtaining or Fulfilling Contracts The Company incurs incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers. Incremental costs of obtaining contracts, which include commissions paid as a result of obtaining contracts with customers, are capitalized to the extent that the Company expects to recover such costs. Capitalized costs are amortized in a pattern that is consistent with the Company s transfer to the customer of the related goods and services. Such costs are recorded in Other long term assets and were and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized and , respectively, in expense related to the amortization of the capitalized contract costs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized and , respectively, in expense related to the amortization of the capitalized contract costs.

 Overview 
 
 We are an innovative health technology business with a mission to revolutionize patient care globally through accessible, affordable, clinically relevant, portable ultra-low-field ULF magnetic resonance MR brain imaging. Our Swoop Portable MR Imaging System Swoop system produces high-quality, diagnostic images at a lower magnetic field strength than conventional magnetic resonance imaging MRI scanners. Our Swoop system is designed to transform brain MR for the patient, the clinician and the provider, providing a highly differentiated experience for patients, timely imaging to clinicians, and favorable economics for hospital administrators. The Swoop system is a portable, ULF MRI device for producing images that display the internal structures of the head where full diagnostic examination is not clinically practical. When interpreted by a trained physician, these images provide information that can be useful in determining a diagnosis. Healthcare professionals can use the Swoop system to make effective clinical diagnoses and decisions in various care settings where conventional MRI devices are inaccessible at the point of care in professional health care facilities such as emergency rooms, intensive care units, hospitals, outpatient clinics and physician offices, or rehabilitation centers. The easy-to-use interface and portable design of our Swoop system make it easily and readily accessible anywhere in a hospital, clinic, or patient care site and it does not require any special facilities accommodations nor specialized personnel to operate safely. ULF MR does not expose patients to harmful ionizing radiation and compares favorably in this regard to X-ray computed tomography CT or positron emission tomography PET ). 
 
 The demand for MR imaging has been increasing due to the aging population and the rising prevalence of neurological, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular conditions, recent approval of new Alzheimer s medications as well as the trends towards decentralized healthcare in mature as well as low- and middle-income countries. Healthcare professionals and insurers recognize imaging as an effective, non-invasive diagnostic tool for evaluation and ongoing monitoring. The Swoop system is the next generation brain imaging device designed to increase access to MRI in a cost-effective manner. We believe our market opportunity is significant across the multiple sites of care where the Swoop system brings clinical and economic value. We estimate in the United States alone our total addressable market for Swoop system device placements to be more than 16 billion. 
 
 Despite their advantages, many healthcare institutions worldwide lack the facilities, specialized operators, and capital necessary to acquire, maintain and staff expensive conventional MRI devices. The Swoop system is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA )-cleared, portable, ULF, MR brain imaging system and is capable of providing imaging at multiple sites of care, such as intensive care units, clinics, emergency departments or physicians offices, and can inform the timely detection, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of acute and chronic conditions inside and outside the hospital. We designed the Swoop system to address the limitations of conventional imaging technologies and make MR brain imaging accessible nearly anytime and anywhere across professional healthcare settings. We believe the adoption of the Swoop system by healthcare professionals has clinical and economic benefits throughout healthcare communities in both high and low resource settings. 
 
 The Swoop system is AI-powered and integrates deep learning, a form of AI in the reconstruction pipeline of T1, T2, diffusion-weighted Imaging DWI ), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR sequences. The integration of deep learning does not require any additional steps from the user. As a result, deep learning can enhance the image quality and, consequently, the diagnostic value of images generated at ULF. The algorithms are designed to improve ULF image quality, while reducing the impact of scan artifacts. The images created with these 
 21 

algorithms were validated by expert radiologists. The Swoop system is used clinically every day as the first mover in the field of portable ULF MRI, and with an install base that continues to expand. The learnings from this market experience have served to improve our software, AI, and denoising algorithms resulting in the image quality and performance improvements of our product over the nine software releases since our initial clearance. As we move forward, we are continuously investing in improving our AI-powered image quality and leveraging each imaging-focused software release to further improve the Swoop system performance. 
 
 Our Swoop system received initial 510(k) clearance for brain imaging from FDA in 2020. In February and October 2023, we received 510(k) clearances from the FDA for our Swoop system AI-powered software. The combination of these two software updates significantly improved DWI, incorporated deep-learning based denoising in the post-processing of DWI images for crisper images, and improved image quality for all Swoop system sequences. In July 2024, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA of the ninth-generation AI-powered Swoop system software. This software update significantly reduces scan times across multiple MR sequences without sacrificing image quality. Outside of the United States, the Swoop system has received marketing authorization for brain imaging in several countries, including the European Union (CE certification), the United Kingdom (UK Conformity Assessment UKCA )), Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In October 2024, we received CE approval for the latest generation of software. 
 
 Key Performance Metrics 
 
 Management reviews and analyzes several key performance metrics including Total revenues and Total Swoop system units sold. These metrics are reviewed and analyzed to evaluate our business performance, identify trends affecting our business, allocate capital, and make strategic decisions. 
 
 Total revenues were 3.6 million and 10.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, an increase of 1.3 million, or 56.4 and 2.2 million, or 26.6 from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. See "Results of Operations" below. Total Swoop system units sold were 13 units and 39 units, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, an increase of 7 units and 9 units from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Factors Affecting Results of Operations 
 
 The following factors have been important to our business and we expect them to impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods: 
 
 Technical innovation 
 
 We have developed our Swoop system through extensive research and development activities. Moreover, our team is dedicated to clinical support programs designed to integrate the Swoop system into an array of diverse healthcare environments, workflow, and applications. We believe that, from our commercial and clinical experience, we are gaining invaluable insights into the Swoop system s clinical utility. We believe these learnings will enable us to further improve our product and develop new services and tools in the future. We are continuously improving our image quality and imaging capabilities. Building upon this foundation and our expertise in ULF brain imaging, we plan to develop new imaging applications, broadening the range of clinical uses for our proprietary technology. Additionally, we are leveraging our strengths in AI and cloud technology to explore the Swoop system s role as a brain imaging clinical decision support platform. While these technical innovations may increase our research and development expenses, we expect them to have a positive impact on our results of operations and profitability in the future. 
 
 Commercialization efforts of the Swoop system 
 
 Our results have included revenue from the United States and outside the United States. Our Swoop system received initial 510(k) clearance from the FDA in 2020. Initially, we have been focused on executing contracts with U.S. hospitals and hospital systems. We have built a direct sales and field support organization in the United States who are working in strong collaboration to increase adoption, support successful implementations and support 
 22 

routine use at expanded customer sites. As of 2024, we have targeted a select number of international markets to add to our commercial efforts operating through distributors. 
 
 Expand sales in international markets 
 
 In 2024, we are executing on our international expansion plans by entering into agreements with experienced and accomplished distributors. We have distribution partners covering several countries across Europe and Asia Pacific, as well as Canada. With the Swoop system s transformative, affordable, and accessible platform, we aim to serve more clinicians and patients needing brain imaging across the globe. The Swoop system has received marketing authorization for brain imaging in several countries, including the European Union (CE certification), the United Kingdom (UKCA), Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Additionally, we have started the regulatory approval process in India through Central Drugs Standard Control Organization. 
 Our commitment to the vision of providing affordable and accessible imaging that enables earlier detection and timely management of health conditions worldwide is furthermore advanced by grant funding from the BMGF. Through our engagement with the BMGF, we have deployed the Swoop system in low-middle income settings without readily-accessible MRI technology. During 2020 and 2021, we were awarded multiple grants totaling 5.0 million from the BMGF for the provision and equipping of sites with our portable MR brain imaging system to enable the performance of a multi-site study focused on optimizing diagnostic image quality. These grants are designed to provide data to validate the use of the Swoop system in measuring the impact of maternal anemia, malnutrition, infection and birth related injury. These grants are designed to support the deployment of a total of 25 Swoop system devices and other services to investigators, which commenced in the spring of 2021 and was completed by February 2024. In May 2023, we were awarded an additional 3.4 million grant from the BMGF to continue to develop a scalable approach to measuring neurodevelopment via low-field MRI in neonates, infants, and young children in low-to-middle income countries through February 2026. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed and fulfilled grant deliverables and milestones amounting to 1.5 million and we received cash grant funding of 1.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, we recorded restricted cash of 0.2 million with an offset to deferred grant funding in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Other income (expense), net increased by 71 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other income, net during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 52 thousand consisting primarily of interest income from customer financing of approximately 30 thousand, and a net realized gain on foreign currencies of approximately 25 thousand, offset by other expenses of 3 thousand. 
 
 Other income, net increased by 61 thousand the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other income, net during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 73 thousand consisting primarily of interest income from customer financing of approximately 78 thousand, and a net realized gain on foreign currencies of approximately 6 thousand, offset by other expenses of 11 thousand. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock. We have incurred significant cash burn and recurring net losses, which includes a net loss of 30.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and an accumulated deficit of 284.0 million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 45.8 million. As we continue to invest in research and development of our products and sales and marketing, we expect to continue to incur a significant cash burn and recurring net losses for the foreseeable future until such time that our product and services sales generate enough gross profit to cover our operating expenses. However, we can provide no assurance that our product and service sales will generate a net profit in the future or that our cash resources will be sufficient to continue our commercialization and development activities. 
 
 In November 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC pursuant to which we registered for sale up to 150 million of any combination of our Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine. Our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 also includes a prospectus (the Sales Agreement Prospectus covering up to an aggregate of 50.0 million in shares of Class A common stock that we may issue and sell from time to time, through B. Riley Securities, Inc. B. Riley acting as our sales agent, pursuant to the sales agreement that we entered into with B. Riley in November 2023 (the Sales Agreement ), for our at-the-market equity program. We are not obligated to make any sales of Class A common stock under the Sales Agreement. As of the filing of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are subject to the SEC general instructions of Form S-3 known as the baby shelf rules. Under these instructions, the amount of funds we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any 12-month period using our registration statement on Form S-3 is limited to one-third of the aggregate market value of the shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates. Therefore, we are limited in the amount of proceeds we are able to raise by selling shares of our common stock using our Form S-3, including under the Sales Agreement, until such time as our public float exceeds 75 million. On March 22, 2024, we filed an amendment to the Sales Agreement Prospectus, pursuant to which, as of such date, we may offer and sell shares of our Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 22.8 million from time to time through or to B. Riley. As of September 30, 2024 and during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a total of 728,188 
 26 

shares of our Class A common stock, for total gross and net proceeds of 0.8 million, have been issued and sold under the Sales Agreement. 
 
 Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if capital is not available when, and in the amounts needed, we could be required to delay, scale back or abandon some or all of our development programs, commercialization of our products, and other operations which could materially harm our operations, financial condition and operating results. We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with proceeds from the sales of our products and services, will enable us to conduct our planned operations for at least the next 12 months. Factors that could accelerate cash needs include: (i) delays in achieving scientific and technical milestones; (ii) unforeseen capital expenditures and fabrication costs related to manufacturing; (iii) changes we may make in our business or commercialization and hiring strategy; (iv) costs of running a public company; (v) higher inflation and increases in product transportation and labor costs; and (vi) other items affecting our forecasted level of expenditures and use of cash resources including potential acquisitions. 
 
 We expect to use our cash to further invest in the development of our products and services, commercial expansion, and for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 
 Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including market adoption of our products; the cost and timing of establishing additional sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; the cost of our research and development activities; our ability to enter into and maintain collaborations; the cost and timing of potential future regulatory clearances or approvals for our products; and the effect of competing technological and market developments. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Future debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we do not have or are not able to obtain sufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products and services or cease operations. 
 
 Cash 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 45.8 million. Our future capital requirements may vary from those currently planned and will depend on various factors including further development costs, commercialization strategy, international expansion, and regulatory costs. If we need additional funds and are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may need to curtail significantly our product development and commercialization efforts to provide sufficient funds to continue our operations, which could adversely affect our business prospects.

Net cash used in operating activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities of 30.4 million was due primarily to a net loss of 30.3 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 4.3 million, partially offset 
 27 

by non-cash items of 4.2 million. Non-cash items were primarily stock-based compensation expense of 3.3 million, depreciation expense of 0.8 million and loss on disposal of property and equipment, net of 0.2 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were driven primarily by an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables of 4.9 million driven primarily by increased revenue, an increase in inventory of 0.6 million, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued expense and other current liabilities of 0.9 million and a decrease in prepaid inventory of 0.7 million. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities of 31.9 million was due primarily to a net loss of 33.6 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 2.6 million, partially offset by non-cash items of 4.4 million. Non-cash items were primarily stock-based compensation expense of 3.5 million and depreciation expense of 0.8 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were driven primarily by an increase in inventory of 2.5 million, a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 0.8 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of 0.4 million, an increase in accounts receivable of 0.3 million, and an increase in unbilled receivables of 0.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 1.0 million, a decrease in prepaid inventory of 0.3 million, and an increase in accounts payable of 0.2 million.

 Net cash provided by financing activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities of 1.0 million consisting primarily of proceeds from issuance of Class A common stock under the Sales Agreement of 0.8 million and proceeds from stock options exercises of 0.2 million. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities of 0.1 million was proceeds from option exercises. 
 
 Contractual obligations 
 
 We sponsor a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering all eligible U.S. employees. Contributions to the 401(k) plan are discretionary. We did not make any matching contributions to the 401(k) plan for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Through our engagement with the BMGF, we have deployed and continue to deploy the Swoop system in low-middle income settings without readily-accessible MRI technology. The multiple grants provided by our research partnership with the BMGF, which commenced funding in the spring of 2020, support the deployment of 25 Swoop system and accessories to investigators. The ongoing investigation is designed to provide data to validate the potential use of the Swoop system in measuring the impact of maternal anemia, malnutrition, infection, and birth-related injury. In May 2023, we were awarded an additional 3-year grant from the BMGF to continue to develop a scalable approach to measuring neurodevelopment via ULF brain imaging in neonates, infants, and young children in low-to-middle income countries. 
 
 Our purchase commitments and obligations include all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. A majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. 
 
 We had no other significant contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024.

For information on contingencies, refer to Note 13 in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 
 Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about items that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Except as described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements , to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our results of operations or financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates, inflation risk, and foreign exchange risk. We do not hold, issue or enter into any financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. We do not have significant exposure to foreign currencies. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2024 consisted of 46.0 million in money market funds, demand deposit and savings accounts. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The goals of our investment policy are liquidity and capital preservation. We believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these assets as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short-term nature of our cash equivalents. Based on our balance sheet position at September 30, 2024, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by 0.2 million. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, other than its impact on the general economy. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to inflationary pressures, we might not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 We operate our business primarily within the United States and currently execute the majority of our transactions in U.S. dollars. We have not utilized hedging strategies with respect to such foreign exchange exposure. This limited foreign currency translation risk is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
