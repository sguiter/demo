 points for every dollar spent, and the customer would earn a free entr e after earning points. The free entr e reward expires after days. Under the enhanced program, Potbelly Perks members will earn or more coins, the equivalent of points under the legacy program, for every dollar they spend. The number of coins earned per dollar is dependent on each member's annual spend with Potbelly. Coins can be redeemed for a variety of items across the Potbelly menu. The coins expire one year after they are earned. The change in program did not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 We defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of points and coins earned by Potbelly Perks members towards free entr es and other menu items as they are earned, and a corresponding deferred revenue liability is established in accrued expenses. The deferral is based on the estimated value of the unredeemed points and rewards. The estimated value and the estimated redemption rates are based on a historical data analysis of loyalty reward redemptions. Estimated breakage is recognized in net shop sandwich sales in the consolidated statement of operations. When points and coins are redeemed, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce accrued expenses. 
 Contract Liabilities 
 We record current and noncurrent contract liabilities in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively, for initial franchise fees, gift cards, and the loyalty programs. We have no other contract liabilities or contract assets recorded.

 Revolving Facility 
 On February 7, 2024, Potbelly Sandwich Works, LLC entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with Wintrust Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Agent ), the other loan parties party thereto and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving loan facility with an aggregate commitment of million (the Revolving Facility , the commitments thereunder, the Revolving Commitments ). Concurrently with entry into the Credit Agreement, we repaid in full and terminated the obligations and commitments of the lenders under a term loan facility described in more detail below. Proceeds from the Revolving Facility will be used for general corporate and working capital purposes. The Revolving Commitments expire on February 7, 2027. 
 Loans under the Credit Agreement will initially bear interest, at our option, at either one-month term secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR") or the base rate plus, in each case, an applicable rate per annum, based upon the Consolidated Adjusted Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The applicable rate may vary between and with respect to borrowings which are based upon the one-month term SOFR and between and with respect to borrowings which are based upon the base rate. The applicable rate with respect to one-month term SOFR borrowings is and the applicable rate with respect to base rate borrowings is , based upon ratios calculated in the most recent compliance certificate for the fiscal quarter ending on June 30, 2024. 
 We may prepay the Revolving Commitments at any time and from time to time in whole or in part without premium or penalty, subject to prior notice in accordance with the Credit Agreement. 
 Subject to certain customary exceptions, obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and all of the Company s current and future wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors. 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to incur certain indebtedness and liens, undergo certain mergers, consolidations and certain other fundamental changes, make certain investments, make certain dispositions and acquisitions, enter into

 million (the Term Loan ). Concurrent with entry into the Term Loan Credit Agreement, we repaid in full and terminated the obligations and commitments under our former senior secured credit facility (the Former Credit Facility ). In connection with entering into the Term Loan Credit Agreement, we paid million in debt issuance costs, all of which were capitalized. The remaining proceeds from the Term Loan were used to pay related transaction fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. 
 The Term Loan Credit Agreement was scheduled to mature on February 7, 2028. We were required to make principal payments equal to of the initial principal of the Term Loan on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. If not previously paid, any remaining principal balance would be due on the maturity date. 
 Loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement bore interest, at the Company s option, at either the term SOFR plus per annum or base rate plus per annum. 
 The Term Loan could be prepaid in agreed-upon minimum principal amounts, subject to prepayment fees equal to (a) if the prepayment occurred on or prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, a customary make-whole amount plus of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan, (b) if the prepayment occurred after such one (1) year anniversary and prior to the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date, of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan, (c) if the prepayment occurred after such second anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan and (d) thereafter, no prepayment fee. 
 On February 7, 2024, we repaid in full and terminated the obligations and commitments under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. As a result of repaying and terminating the Term Loan, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of million for the year to date ended September 29, 2024. 
 Former Credit Facility 
 On August 7, 2019, we entered into a second amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement (the "Former Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan ). The Former Credit Agreement amends and restates that certain amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement, dated as of December 9, 2015, and amended on May 3, 2019 (collectively, the "Prior Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan. The Former Credit Agreement provided, among other things, for a revolving credit facility in a maximum principal amount million, with possible future increases of up to million under an expansion feature. Borrowings under the credit facility generally bore interest at our option at either (i) a eurocurrency rate determined by reference to the applicable LIBOR rate plus a specified margin or (ii) a prime rate as announced by JP Morgan plus a specified margin. The applicable margin was determined based upon our consolidated total leverage ratio. On the last day of each calendar quarter, we were required to pay a commitment fee of per annum in respect of any unused commitments under the credit facility. 
 As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022, we subsequently amended the Former Credit Agreement during fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022. The Former Credit Agreement provided for a revolving credit facility in a maximum principal amount of million following these amendments.

 Business 
 Potbelly is a neighborhood sandwich concept that has been feeding customers smiles with warm, toasty sandwiches, signature salads, hand-dipped shakes and other fresh menu items, customized just the way customers want them, for more than 40 years. Potbelly promises Fresh, Fast Friendly service in a welcoming environment that reflects the local neighborhood. Our employees are trained to engage with our customers in a genuine way to provide a personalized experience. We believe the combination of our great food, people and atmosphere creates a devoted base of Potbelly customers. 
 We strive to be proactive and deliberate in our efforts to drive profitable growth in our existing business. Our "Traffic-Driven Profitability" Five-Pillar strategic plan includes a prioritized set of low-cost strategic investments that we believe will deliver strong returns. The five pillars are: 
 Craveable-Quality Food at a Great Value 
 People Creating Good Vibes 
 Customer Experiences that Drive Traffic Growth 
 Digitally-Driven Awareness, Connection and Traffic 
 Franchise-Focused Development 
 Our shop model is designed to generate, and has generated, strong cash flow, attractive shop-level financial results and high returns on investment. We operate our shops successfully in a wide range of geographic markets, population densities and real estate settings. We aim to generate average shop-level profit margins, a non-GAAP measure, which range from the mid to high teens. Our ability to achieve such margins and returns depends on a number of factors, including consumer behaviors, the economy, and labor and commodity costs. For example, if we were to face increasing labor and commodity costs, we have the ability to partially offset such impacts by increasing menu prices. Although there is no

 guarantee that we will be able to maintain these returns, we believe our attractive shop economics support our ability to profitably grow our brand in new and existing markets. 
 On March 2, 2022, we announced our Franchise Growth Acceleration Initiative, which included a plan to grow our franchise units domestically through multi-unit shop development area agreements, which may include refranchising certain company-operated shops. Deals for refranchised shops typically include cash consideration for the sale of the current shops as well as development agreement fees for commitments to develop new shops to fully penetrate existing markets. On an ongoing basis, we collect additional cash consideration for royalties and lease payments. 
 The table below sets forth a roll-forward of company-operated and franchise operated activities:

 Key Performance Indicators 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures for determining how the business is performing are comparable store sales, number of company-operated shop openings, shop-level profit margins, and Adjusted EBITDA. 
 Company-Operated Comparable Store Sales 
 Comparable store sales reflect the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable company-operated store base. We define the comparable company-operated store base to include those shops open for 15 months or longer. During the quarters ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, there was an average of 341 and 360 shops, respectively, in our comparable company-operated store base. Comparable store sales growth can be generated by an increase in traffic and/or by increases in the average check amount resulting from a shift in menu mix and/or increase in price. This measure highlights performance of existing shops as the impact of new shop openings is excluded. For purposes of the comparable store sales calculation, traffic is defined as the sum of entr e's purchased, which includes sandwiches, salads, and bowls of soup or mac and cheese. In fiscal years that include a 53rd week, the last week of the fourth quarter and fiscal year is excluded from the year-over-year comparisons so that the time periods are consistent. In a fiscal year that follows a 53-week year, the current period sales continue to be compared to the sales from the prior 52 weeks rather than the weeks of the same fiscal period from the prior year. The trailing 52-week method provides better alignment to sales drivers when comparing sales performance. 
 Number of Company-Operated Shop Openings 
 The number of company-operated shop openings reflects the number of shops opened during a particular reporting period. Before we open new shops, we incur pre-opening costs. Often, new shops open with an initial start-up period of higher-than-normal sales volumes, which subsequently decrease to stabilized levels. While sales volumes are generally higher during the initial opening period, new shops typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher cost of sales, labor and other direct operating expenses and as a result, shop-level profit margins are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. The average start-up period is 10 to 13 weeks. With our focus on franchise shop development, we expect company shop development to be limited for the foreseeable future. 
 Number of Franchise-Operated Shop Openings 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 The number of franchise-operated shop openings during a particular reporting period may have an impact on our franchise revenue during that period and subsequent periods. For each franchise-operated shop, we collect an initial franchise fee that is recognized as revenue over the term of the franchise agreement, beginning with the shop opening date. We also collect royalties and other fees from the franchisee after their shop opens and they begin generating sales. We enter into development agreements with some franchisees to open a certain number of shops over a specified development schedule, and we expect the number of franchise-operated shop openings to increase as franchisees make progress on their development commitments. 
 Shop-Level Profit Margin 
 Shop-level profit margin is defined as net company-operated sandwich shop sales less company-operated sandwich shop operating expenses, excluding depreciation, which consists of food, beverage and packaging costs, labor and related expenses, occupancy expenses, and other operating expenses, as a percentage of net company-operated sandwich shop sales. Other operating expenses include all other shop-level operating costs, excluding depreciation, the major components of which are credit card fees, fees to third-party marketplace partners, marketing and advertising, shop technology and software, supply chain costs, operating supplies, utilities, and repair and maintenance costs. Shop-level profit margin is not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe shop-level profit margin is important in evaluating shop-level productivity, efficiency and performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Potbelly before depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the provision for income taxes, adjusted for the impact of the following items that we do not consider representative of ongoing operating performance: stock-based compensation expense, impairment and shop closure expenses, gain or loss on disposal of property and equipment, and gain or loss on Franchise Growth Acceleration Initiative activities, as well as other one-time, non-recurring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of operating performance, as it provides a picture of operating results by eliminating expenses that management does not believe are reflective of underlying business performance.

 Sandwich shop sales, net 
 Sandwich shop sales, net decreased by 7.6 million, or 6.4 , to 110.8 million during the quarter ended September 29, 2024, from 118.3 million during the quarter ended September 24, 2023, primarily driven by our refranchising of 26 company-operated shops since Q2 2023 and a decrease in sales at Company-operated shops. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales from four newly opened Company-operated shops. 
 Franchise royalties, fees and rental income 
 Revenue from franchise royalties, fees and rental income increased by 1.9 million, or 79.2 , to 4.4 million during the quarter ended September 29, 2024, from 2.4 million during the quarter ended September 24, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in the number of franchised shops due to refranchise transactions, including rental income from new subleases on certain refranchised shops and to a lesser extent new franchise operated shop openings. 
 Food, Beverage, and Packaging Costs 
 Food, beverage, and packaging costs decreased by 3.4 million, or 10.4 , to 29.5 million during the quarter ended September 29, 2024, from 32.9 million during the quarter ended September 24, 2023.

 La bor and related expenses decreased by 1.9 million, or 5.6 , to 32.3 million during the quarter ended September 29, 2024, from 34.2 million for the quarter ended September 24, 2023, primarily driven by shops that were refranchised since the beginning of 2023 and the continued optimization of our hours-based labor guide and other labor-saving initiatives. As a percentage of sandwich shop sales, labor and related expenses increased to 29.1 during the quarter ended September 29, 2024, from 28.9 for the quarter ended September 24, 2023, primarily driven by sales leverage in certain labor related costs not directly variable with sales. 
 Occupancy Expenses 
 Occupancy expenses decreased by 0.9 million, or 6.7 , to 11.8 million during the quarter ended September 29, 2024, from 12.7 million during the quarter ended September 24, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in lease expenses as a result of our refranchising efforts.

As a percentage of sandwich shop sales, other operating expenses increased to 18.3 for the quarter ended September 29, 2024, from 18.0 for the quarter ended September 24, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in marketing and advertising spend, partially offset by decreases in utility costs and controllable expenses, such as food equipment and restaurant supplies. 
 Franchise Support, Rent and Marketing Expenses 
 Franchise support, rent and marketing expenses increased by 1.2 million, or 80.0 , to 2.8 million during the quarter ended September 29, 2024 compared to 1.6 million during the quarter ended September 24, 2023, driven by an increase in franchise support expense and rent expense as a result of the refranchising efforts of company-operated shops, as well as increased marketing and advertising expenses. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 1.3 million, or 10.9 , to 10.6 million during the quarter ended September 29, 2024, from 11.9 million during the quarter ended September 24, 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in incentive compensation.

 Impairment, loss on disposal of property and equipment and shop closures decreased by 0.9 million, or 41.2 , to 1.3 million during the year to date ended September 29, 2024, from 2.2 million during the year to date ended September 24, 2023. The decrease was primarily related to higher impairment charges and loss on disposals of assets that occurred during the year to date ended September 29, 2024 compared to year to date ended September 24, 2023. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Net interest expense was 0.7 million during the year to date ended September 29, 2024 compared to 2.5 million during the year to date ended September 24, 2023, as a result of lower interest rates on the Revolving Facility as compared with the Term Loan and lower average borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Facility. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt was 2.4 million during the year to date ended September 29, 2024, compared to 0.2 million during the year to date ended September 24, 2023. The increase was due to the extinguishment of the Term Loan in the first quarter of 2024, which was subject to a prepayment penalty and required the company to write-off of debt issuance costs originally capitalized when the Term Loan was executed. 
 Income Tax (Benefit) Expense 
 We recognized an income tax benefit of 30.9 million for the year to date ended September 29, 2024, compared to expense of 0.2 million for the year to date ended September 24, 2023. This change was primarily due to a 31.6 million valuation allowance release as we concluded that it was more likely than not that we will be able to utilize our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. 
 Non-Controlling Interests 
 The portion of income attributable to non-controlling interests did not materially change for the year to date ended September 29, 2024 from the year to date ended September 24, 2023

Shop-level profit margin is not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 8.7 million and 22.9 million for the quarter and year to date ended September 29, 2024, respectively, compared to 7.3 million and 20.9 million for the quarter and year to date ended September 24, 2023, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA is not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of operating performance, as it provides a picture of operating results by eliminating expenses that management does not believe are reflective of underlying business performance.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our ongoing primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash provided from operating activities, existing cash and cash equivalents, and our Revolving Facility. In the short term, our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are existing shop capital investments, maintenance, lease obligations, working capital and general corporate needs. Our requirement for working capital is not significant since our customers pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or payment cards (credit or debit) at the time of sale. Thus, we are able to sell certain inventory items before we need to pay our suppliers for such items. Company-operated shops do not require significant inventories or receivables. 
 We ended the quarter ended September 29, 2024 with a cash balance of 11.9 million and total liquidity (cash less restricted cash, plus available cash on Revolving Facility) of 38.2 million, compared to a cash balance of 31.7 million and total liquidity (cash less restricted cash) of 30.9 million at the end of quarter September 24, 2023. We believe that cash from our operations and the cash available to us under the Revolving Facility provide us sufficient liquidity for at least the next twelve months . 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents summary cash flow information for the periods indicated: 
 For the Year to Date Ended September 29, 2024 September 24, 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 13,060 14,501 Investing activities (13,000) (10,890) Financing activities (22,648) 12,458 Net change in cash (22,588) 16,069 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 13.1 million for the year to date ended September 29, 2024, from cash provided in operating activities of 14.5 million for the year to date ended September 24, 2023. The 1.4 million change in operating cash was primarily driven by higher incentive payments made in 2024 compared to the prior year and working capital changes, primarily within accrued expenses. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased to 13.0 million for the year to date ended September 29, 2024, from 10.9 million for the year to date ended September 24, 2023. The 2.1 million increase in cash outflow was driven by additional capital expenditures which related to ongoing investment in our company-owned shops and digital platforms as well as a reduction in cash received for refranchised shops. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities decreased to 22.6 million for the year to date ended September 29, 2024 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 12.5 million for the year to date ended September 24, 2023. The 35.1 million decrease in financing cash was primarily driven by repayment of the Term Loan compared with the prior year when the company had proceeds from the Term Loan. 
 Revolving Facility 
 On February 7, 2024, Potbelly Sandwich Works, LLC entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with Wintrust Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Agent ), the other loan parties party thereto and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving loan facility with an aggregate commitment of 30 million (the Revolving Facility , the commitments thereunder, the Revolving Commitments ). Concurrently with entry into the Credit Agreement, we repaid in full and terminated the obligations and commitments of the lenders under a term loan 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 facility described in more detail below. Proceeds from the Revolving Facility will be used for general corporate and working capital purposes. The Revolving Commitments expire on February 7, 2027. 
 Loans under the Credit Agreement will initially bear interest, at our option, at either one-month term secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR") or the base rate plus, in each case, an applicable rate per annum, based upon the Consolidated Adjusted Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The applicable rate may vary between 3.75 and 2.75 with respect to borrowings which are based upon the one-month term SOFR and between 2.25 and 1.25 with respect to borrowings which are based upon the base rate. The applicable rate with respect to one-month term SOFR borrowings is 3.25 and the applicable rate with respect to base rate borrowings is 1.75 , based upon ratios calculated in the most recent compliance certificate for the fiscal quarter ending on June 30, 2024. 
 We may prepay the Revolving Commitments at any time and from time to time in whole or in part without premium or penalty, subject to prior notice in accordance with the Credit Agreement. 
 Subject to certain customary exceptions, obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and all of the Company s current and future wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors. 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to incur certain indebtedness and liens, undergo certain mergers, consolidations and certain other fundamental changes, make certain investments, make certain dispositions and acquisitions, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into certain swap transactions, make certain restricted payments (including certain payment of dividends, repurchases of stock and payments on certain indebtedness), engage in certain transactions with affiliates, enter into certain types of restricted agreements, make certain changes to its organizational documents and indebtedness, and use the proceeds of the Revolving Commitments for certain non-permitted uses. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that we maintain compliance with certain minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum consolidated leverage ratios as set forth in the Credit Agreement. 
 The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs, the Agent and lenders are entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Credit Agreement, termination of commitments thereunder and all other actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. 
 Since the execution of the Credit Agreement, we have been in compliance with all terms and covenants. 
 Term Loan 
 On February 7, 2023 (the Closing Date ), we entered into a credit and guaranty agreement (the Term Loan Credit Agreement with Sagard Holdings Manager LP as administrative agent. The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a term loan facility with an aggregate commitment of 25 million (the Term Loan ). Concurrent with entry into the Term Loan Credit Agreement, we repaid in full and terminated the obligations and commitments under our former senior secured credit facility (the Former Credit Facility ). In connection with entering into the Term Loan Credit Agreement, we paid 2.2 million in debt issuance costs, all of which were capitalized. The remaining proceeds from the Term Loan were used to pay related transaction fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. 
 The Term Loan Credit Agreement was scheduled to mature on February 7, 2028. We were required to make principal payments equal to 1.25 of the initial principal of the Term Loan on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. If not previously paid, any remaining principal balance would be due on the maturity date. 
 Loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement bore interest, at the Company s option, at either the term SOFR plus 9.25 per annum or base rate plus 8.25 per annum. 
 The Term Loan could be prepaid in agreed-upon minimum principal amounts, subject to prepayment fees equal to (a) if the prepayment occurred on or prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, a customary make-whole amount plus 3.00 of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan, (b) if the prepayment occurred after such one (1) year anniversary and prior to the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date, 3.00 of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan, (c) if the prepayment occurred after such second anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date 1.00 of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan and (d) thereafter, no prepayment fee.

Table of Contents 

On February 7, 2024, we repaid in full and terminated the obligations and commitments under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. As a result of repaying and terminating the Term Loan, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 2.4 million for the year to date ended September 29, 2024. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 On May 8, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to 65.0 million of our outstanding common stock ("2018 Repurchase Program"). For the quarter and year to date ended September 29, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the 2018 Repurchase Program. The 2018 Repurchase Program was terminated on May 7, 2024. 
 On May 7, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to 20.0 million of our outstanding common stock at any time during the next three years ("2024 Repurchase Program"). This program replaces the 2018 Repurchase Program, which was terminated upon execution of the 2024 Repurchase Program. The program permits us, from time to time, to purchase shares in the open market (including in pre-arranged stock trading plans in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act) or in privately negotiated transactions. The number of common shares actually repurchased, and the timing and price of repurchases, will depend upon market conditions, SEC requirements and other factors. Repurchases may be started or stopped at any time without prior notice depending on market conditions and other factors. For the quarter and year to date ended September 29, 2024, we repurchased 29,113 and 115,558 shares of our common stock under the 2024 Repurchase Program for an aggregate of 0.2 million and 0.9 million, respectively, including cost and commission, in open market transactions. Repurchased shares are included as treasury stock in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the condensed consolidated statements of equity. 
 Securities Purchase Agreement 
 On February 9, 2021, we closed on a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "SPA") for the sale by us of 3,249,668 shares of our common stock at a par value of 0.01 per share and the issuance of warrants to purchase 1,299,861 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 5.45 per warrant for gross proceeds of 16.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses of approximately 1.0 million. The warrants are currently exercisable until August 12, 2026. The proceeds received from the SPA were allocated between shares and warrants based on their relative fair values at closing. The warrants were valued utilizing the Black-Scholes method. During the quarter and year to date ended September 29, 2024, no warrants and 240,187 warrants were exercised at the exercise price of 5.45 per warrant, respectively. As of September 29, 2024, we had 883,402 warrants outstanding that are exercisable through August 12, 2026. 
 Equity Offering Program 
 On November 3, 2021, we entered into a certain Equity Sales Agreement (the "Sales Agreement") with William Blair Company, L.L.C., as agent ("William Blair") pursuant to which we may sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 40.0 million from time to time, in our sole discretion, through an "at the market" equity offering program under which William Blair will act as sales agent. As of September 29, 2024, we have not sold any shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results, and require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We have made no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates since the last annual report. Our critical accounting estimates are identified and described in our annual consolidated financial statements and related notes.
