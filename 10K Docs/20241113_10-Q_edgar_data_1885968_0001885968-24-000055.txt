 The Company pays the Investment Adviser a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee are ultimately be borne by the unitholders. 
 Base Management Fee 
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s average called capital commitments, at the end of the then-current quarter and the prior calendar quarter (and, in the case of our first quarter, called capital commitments as of such quarter-end). Called capital commitments is defined in the Investment Advisory Agreement as the aggregate purchase price paid to purchase Common Units of the Company by all unitholders pursuant to a Subscription Agreement. Called capital commitments do not include assets acquired through the use of leverage. The Investment Adviser does not receive any fees on unused capital commitments. The base management fee for any partial quarter was appropriately prorated. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, base management fees were and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, base management fees were and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and was payable to the Investment Adviser relating to base management fees. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The Company pays the Investment Adviser an incentive fee consisting of two parts. The first part is determined and paid quarterly based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income and the second part is determined and payable in arrears based on net capital gains as of the end of each calendar year or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income is defined as interest income, distribution income and any other income accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter, including the base management fee, expenses payable to the Administrator under the Administration Agreement, any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred units, but excluding the incentive fee. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. The Investment Adviser is not obligated to return the any incentive fee it receives on PIK interest that is later determined to be uncollectible in cash. 
 The Company pays the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income as follows: 
 No incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income in any calendar quarter in which pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed a hurdle rate of annualized) Hurdle Rate 
 of pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than in any quarter annualized).The Company refers to this portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than as the catch-up . The catch-up is meant to provide the Investment Adviser with approximately of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a Hurdle Rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 
 of the pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds in any calendar quarter annualized), which reflects that once the Hurdle Rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all pre-incentive fee net investment income is paid to the Investment Adviser.

 and of income based incentive fees, respectively, were accrued to the Investment Adviser. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and , respectively, of income based incentive fees, were accrued to the Investment Adviser. 
 The second part of the incentive fee is determined on realized capital gains calculated and payable in arrears in cash as of the end of each calendar quarter or upon the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement in an amount equal to of the realized capital gains, if any, on a quarterly basis from the date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC through the end of a given calendar year or upon the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees (the Cumulative Capital Gains ). 
 Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is required to accrue an incentive fee on capital gains, including unrealized capital appreciation even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not included in calculating the incentive fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then the Company records an incentive fee on capital gain incentive fee equal to of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. If such amount is negative, no accrual is recorded for such period. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were capital gain incentive fees accrued to the Investment Adviser. Incentive fees on Cumulative Capital Gains crystallize at calendar year-end.

As noted above, the significant unobservable input used in yield analysis is discount rate based on comparable market yields. Significant increases in discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. The significant unobservable input used in the market approach is the comparable company multiple. The multiple is used to estimate the enterprise value of the underlying investment. An increase/decrease in the multiple would result in an increase/decrease, respectively, in the fair value. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the comparative yield or discount rate. The comparative yield and discount rate are used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment. An increase/decrease in the comparative yield or discount rate would result in a decrease/increase, respectively, in the fair value.

 OVERVIEW 
 We are a non-diversified, externally managed specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. We are externally managed by our Adviser, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. We are not a subsidiary of, or consolidated with, Morgan Stanley. 
 Our investment objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns via current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by investing primarily in directly originated senior secured term loans issued by U.S. middle-market companies in which private equity sponsors have a controlling equity stake in the portfolio company. For purposes of this report, middle-market companies refers to companies that, in general, generate annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization EBITDA in the range of approximately 15 million to 200 million, although not all of our portfolio companies will meet this criterion. 
 We invest primarily in directly originated senior secured term loans including first lien senior secured term loans and second lien senior secured term loans, higher-yielding assets such as mezzanine debt, unsecured debt, equity investments and other opportunistic asset purchases. Typical middle-market senior loans may be issued by middle-market companies in the context of leveraged buyouts LBOs ), acquisitions, debt refinancings, recapitalizations, and other similar transactions. We generally expect our debt investments to have a stated term of five to eight years and typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark (such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR). 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends or distributions of income on any direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of loans and equity investments and various other loan origination and other fees, including commitment, origination, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. 
 Pursuant to the exemptive relief granted by the SEC to us and our Adviser (as amended, the "Order"), we are able to enter into certain negotiated co-investment transactions alongside certain Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds (each as defined in the Order) in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies, and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with the Order. Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our eligible directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our unitholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our unitholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our unitholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies. 
 We have applied for a new exemptive relief order which, if granted, would supersede the Order and would permit us greater flexibility with respect to negotiated co-investment transactions alongside certain Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds (each as defined in the application). There can be no assurance that we will obtain such new exemptive relief from the SEC . 
 
 KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle-market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends or distributions of income on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and equity securities and various 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as SOFR, or historically LIBOR. Interest on these debt investments is generally paid quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we may receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees.

 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of: (i) investment advisory fees, including base management fees and incentive fees, to our Investment Adviser pursuant to the investment advisory agreement between us and our Investment Adviser (the Investment Advisory Agreement (ii) costs and other expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by our Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the administration agreement (the Administration Agreement between us and MS Private Credit Administrative Services LLC (the Administrator and (iii) other operating expenses as detailed below:

 Investment Performance Rating 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments. Our Investment Adviser has developed a classification system to group investments into four categories. The investments are evaluated regularly and assigned a category based on certain credit metrics. Our Investment Adviser s ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. Please see below for a description of the four categories of the Investment Adviser s Internal Risk Rating system: 
 Risk Rating 1 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 1 involve the least amount of risk relative to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. Risk Rating 1 investments performance is above our initial underwriting expectations and the business trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company, or the likelihood of a potential exit. 
 Risk Rating 2 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 2 involve a level of risk relative to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. Risk Rating 2 investments are generally performing in line with our initial

 underwriting expectations and risk factors to ultimately recoup the cost of our principal investment are neutral to favorable. All new originated or acquired investments are initially included in Risk Rating 2. 
 Risk Rating 3 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 3 indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition has increased materially since the origination or acquisition of the investment, such as declining financial performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, principal and interest payments are not more than 120 days past due. 
 Risk Rating 4 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 4 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicate that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For Risk Rating 4 investments, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition upon exit. 
 The distribution of our portfolio on the Investment Adviser s Internal Risk Rating System as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows: 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Fair Value of Portfolio Fair Value of Portfolio Risk rating 1 Risk rating 2 1,914,415 95.7 1,649,919 97.8 Risk rating 3 85,577 4.3 21,632 1.3 Risk rating 4 15,995 0.9 1,999,992 100.0 1,687,546 100.0

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net realized losses on our investments was 12,655, which was primarily due to the restructuring of three portfolio companies. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net change in unrealized appreciation on our investments of 4,313 and 5,125 was primarily driven by changes in spreads in the primary and secondary markets, partially offset by the reversal of unrealized depreciation in connection with the aforementioned restructuring. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, net change in unrealized appreciation on our investments of 11,439 and 13,428, respectively, was primarily driven changes in spreads in the primary and secondary markets.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We generate cash from the net proceeds of offerings of our Common Units, net borrowings from our credit facilities, and from cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of the private offering of our Common Units. Our primary use of cash are investments in portfolio companies, payments of our expenses and payment of cash distributions to our unitholders. As of September 30, 2024, we had four revolving credit facilities outstanding, as described in Debt below. We may also from time to time enter into new credit facilities, increase the size of existing credit facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 51.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, which taken together with our approximately 714.3 million of availability under our credit facilities (subject to borrowing base availability) and our approximately 205.0 million of uncalled capital commitments to purchase Common Units, we expect to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of September 30, 2024, we believed we had adequate financial resources to satisfy the unfunded portfolio company commitments of 291.4 million. 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had received aggregate capital commitments of 1,000 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued capital calls to our unitholders. As a result, the total Common Units issued and proceeds received related to capital drawdowns delivered pursuant to the subscription agreements were as follows:

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting estimates including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, including Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies. 
 We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Investments, Revenue Recognition, Deferred Financing Costs and Debt Issuance Costs and Income Taxes. The valuation of investments is our most significant critical estimate. The most significant input is the discount rate used in yield analysis that is based on comparable market yields. Significant increases in the discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. For a further discussion and disclosure of key inputs and considerations related to this estimate, refer to "Note 5 Fair Value Measurements" included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following (which are defined in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements if not defined herein): 
 the Investment Advisory Agreement; 
 the Administration Agreement; and 
 the Indemnification Agreement. 
 For further details, see Note 3. Related Party Transactions to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 MS Credit Partners Holdings Investment 
 MS Credit Partners Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley and an affiliate of the Adviser, invested seed capital of 10 in us on September 28, 2021. Morgan Stanley has no further capital, liquidity or other financial obligation to us beyond this equity investment.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, market risk and interest rate risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of portfolio companies. During periods of market dislocation, we will seek to invest prudently in the secondary loan market to provide our investors better risk adjusted returns while adhering to our core investment tenants. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price. To ensure accurate valuations, our investments are valued at fair value in good faith by the Company s Board of Directors, based on, among other things, the input of the Investment Adviser, including the Valuation Designee, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board of Directors or Valuation Designee, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the investments we hold. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Market Risk 
 The market value of a security may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. These fluctuations may cause a security to be worth less than the price originally paid for it, or less than it was worth at an earlier time. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, sector of the economy or the market as a whole. Global economies and financial markets are increasingly interconnected, which increases the probabilities that conditions in one country or region might adversely impact issuers in a different country or region. Conditions affecting the general economy, including political, social, or economic instability at the local, regional, or global level, may also affect the market value of a security. Health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases, as well as other incidents that interrupt the expected course of events, such as natural disasters, war or civil disturbance, acts of terrorism, power outages and other unforeseeable and external events, and the public response to or fear of such diseases or events, have and may in the future have an adverse effect on a company s investments and net asset value and can lead to increased market volatility. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors General Risk Factors We are operating in a period of capital markets volatility and economic uncertainty. The conditions have materially and adversely affected debt and equity capital markets in the United States, and any future volatility or instability in capital markets may have a negative impact on our business and operations. of our Form 10-K and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors General Risk Factors Terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, outbreaks or pandemics, such as the Coronavirus pandemic, may impact our portfolio companies and our Adviser and harm our business, operating results and financial condition of our Form 10-K. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 99.6 of our debt investments were at floating rates. Based on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical reference rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors and ceilings for floating rate debt instruments assuming no changes in our investments and borrowing structure as of September 30, 2024) (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Interest Interest Net Basis Point Change - Interest Rates Income Expense Income Up 300 basis points 59,858 (31,820) 28,038 Up 200 basis points 39,905 (21,214) 18,691 Up 100 basis points 19,953 (10,607) 9,346 Up 25 basis points 4,988 (2,652) 2,336 Down 25 basis points (4,988) 2,652 (2,336) Down 100 basis points (19,953) 10,607 (9,346) Down 200 basis points (39,905) 21,214 (18,691) Down 300 basis points (59,858) 31,820 (28,038) 
 We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts or our credit facilities, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may 
 68 

Table of Contents 

 insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates or higher exchange rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates or investments denominated in foreign currencies. During the periods covered by this Report, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this Report), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).

 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
