owned by Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc. in First Community Bankers Insurance Co., LLC, a Tennessee series limited liability company and licensed property and casualty insurance company. Intercompany balances and transactions, including insurance premium paid by the Bank that were received by the Insurance Subsidiary through an intermediary, have been eliminated. 

As used in these notes, the terms the Company , we , us , or our refer to Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc. and, unless the context clearly suggests otherwise, its consolidated subsidiaries. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, which is greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income by the entity s applicable statutory rate, on an annual basis. Additionally, the amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes and the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions that are equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). Lastly, the amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis; however, retrospective application is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

The accounting policies adopted by management are consistent with authoritative GAAP and are consistent with those followed by our peers.

The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities is a contra-asset valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of held-to-maturity securities to present the net amount expected to be collected. Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics, and considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. With regard to securities issued by states and political subdivisions, management considers (i) issuer bond ratings, (ii) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities, and (iv) internal forecasts. Unrated bonds were underwritten similar to commercial loans and the financial condition of the issuer is monitored periodically. Expected credit losses on commercial loans are applied to unrated bonds. The duration of each bond is used as the remaining life in the calculation of expected credit losses. 

The following table summarizes Moody's and/or Standard Poor's bond ratings (the Company s primary credit quality indicators) for our portfolio of held-to-maturity securities issued by states and political subdivisions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 at amortized cost:

Historical loss rates associated with securities having similar grades as those in our portfolio have generally not been significant. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2024, there were no past due principal or interest payments associated with these securities and none are on nonaccrual.

As of September 30, 2024, management did not have the intent to sell any of the securities before a recovery of cost and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell before the recovery of the amortized cost basis. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased as well as other market conditions for each particular security based upon the structure and remaining principal balance. The fair values of the investment securities are expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity dates or repricing dates or if market yields for such investments decline. Based on these factors, as of September 30, 2024, management believes that the unrealized losses detailed in the table above are temporary and, accordingly, none of these unrealized losses have been recognized in the Company s consolidated statement of income.

Less: Allowance for credit losses 

Deferred origination fees, net of costs 

For purposes of monitoring the performance of the loan portfolio and estimating the allowance for credit losses, the Company's loans receivable portfolio is segmented as follows: (i) commercial real estate; (ii) construction and land development; (iii) residential; (iv) commercial and industrial; (v) and consumer. 

Commercial real estate loans carry risks of the client s ability to repay the loan from the cash flow derived from the underlying real estate. Risks inherent in managing a commercial real estate portfolio relate to sudden or gradual drops in property values as well as changes in the economic climate. Real estate security diminishes risks only to the extent that a market exists for the subject collateral. These risks are attempted to be mitigated by carefully underwriting loans of this type and by following appropriate loan-to-value standards. The Company generally requires personal guarantees or endorsements with respect to these loans and loan-to-value ratios for real estate-commercial loans generally do not exceed 80 . 

Construction and land development real estate loans carry risks that the project will not be finished according to schedule, the project will not be finished according to budget and the value of the collateral may, at any point in time, be less than the principal amount of the loan. Construction loans also bear the risk that the general contractor, who may or may not be a loan customer, may be unable to finish the construction project as planned because of financial pressure unrelated to the project. The Company generally requires personal guarantees or endorsements with respect to these loans and loan-to-value ratios for real estate-commercial loans generally do not exceed 80 . 

Residential real estate mortgage loans, including equity lines of credit, carry risks associated with the continued credit-worthiness of the borrower and the changes in the value of the collateral. 

Commercial and industrial loans carry risks associated with the successful operation of a business or a real estate project, in addition to other risks associated with the ownership of real estate, because the repayment of these loans may be dependent upon the profitability and cash flows of the business or project. In addition, there is risk associated with the value of collateral other than real estate which may depreciate over time and cannot be appraised with as much precision. 

Consumer loans carry risks associated with the continued credit-worthiness of the borrower and the value of the collateral. The Company's consumer loans consist primarily of installment loans made to individuals for personal, family and household purposes. These risks are attempted to be mitigated by following appropriate loan-to-value standards and an experienced management team for this type of portfolio. 

The following tables present the amortized cost basis of loans on nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Gross interest income of would have been recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 if this nonaccrual loan had been current and performing in accordance with the original terms. The Company allocated of its allowance for credit losses to this nonaccrual loan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, one nonaccrual commercial loan totaling was charged off. 

At December 31, 2023, the Company had one nonaccrual commercial real estate loan totaling and one nonaccrual commercial loan totaling . The commercial loan was secured by business assets and a personal guaranty. Gross interest income of would have been recorded in 2023 if these nonaccrual loans had been current and performing in accordance with their original terms.

From time to time, loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be modified. Generally, the modifications we grant are extensions of terms, deferrals of payments for an extended period or interest rate reductions. Occasionally, we may modify a loan by providing principal forgiveness. In some cases, we will modify a loan by providing multiple types, or combinations, of concessions. 

There were no modifications to borrowers experiencing financial distress during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we modified two commercial real estate loans to the same borrower who was experiencing financial distress. The terms of the loans were extended by 12 months. The following table presents the amortized cost basis of loans at September 30, 2024 that were both experiencing financial difficulty and modified during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, by class and type of modification. The percentage of the amortized cost basis of loans that were modified to borrowers in financial distress as compared to the amortized cost basis of each class of loans is also presented below. 

Total 

There were no modifications to borrowers experiencing financial distress during the three- or nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023. There were no payment defaults of modified loans during the previous 12 months. 

Accrued interest receivable on loans totaled and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in accrued interest receivable on the balance sheets. Accrued interest receivable is not included as part of the amortized costs of loans for the allowance for credit losses estimate. 

Credit Quality Indicators 

As part of our portfolio risk management, the Company assigns a risk grade to each loan. The factors used to determine the grade are the payment history of the loan and the borrower, the value of the collateral and net worth of the guarantor, and cash flow projections of the borrower. Excellent, Above Average, Average, Acceptable, and Pass/Watch grades are assigned to loans with limited or no delinquent payments and more than sufficient collateral and/or cash flow. 

A description of the general characteristics of loans characterized as watch list or classified is as follows: 

Special Mention 

 A special mention loan is a loan that management believes has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Company s credit position at some future date. Special mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 

Borrowers may exhibit poor liquidity and leverage positions resulting from generally negative cash flow or negative trends in earnings. Access to alternative financing may be limited to finance companies for business borrowers and may be unavailable for commercial real estate borrowers. 

Substandard 

 A substandard loan is a loan that management believes is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Such loans have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Borrowers may exhibit recent or unexpected unprofitable operations, an inadequate debt service coverage ratio, or marginal liquidity and capitalization. Substandard loans require more intense supervision by Company management. 

Doubtful 

 A doubtful loan is a loan that management believes has all of the weaknesses inherent in a substandard loan with the added characteristic that the weaknesses, based on currently existing facts, conditions, and values, make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable.

The CDI is being amortized over years on a straight-line basis. Annual amortization will be per year through year nine and in year 10. Because the Merger was a tax-free reorganization, neither the goodwill nor the CDI is deductible for income tax purposes. A goodwill impairment analysis is performed annually.

The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2015, at the 0.625 level and was phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reached 2.5 on January 1, 2019). The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a countercyclical capital buffer that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have current applicability to the Bank. 

The aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 

On September 17, 2019, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC finalized a rule that introduces an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations (i.e., the community bank leverage ratio CBLR framework), as required by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. The CBLR framework is designed to reduce burden by removing the requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for qualifying community banking organizations that opt into the framework. 

Under the interim final rules, the community bank leverage ratio was reduced to 8 beginning in the second quarter and for the remainder of calendar year 2020, 8.5 for calendar year 2021, and 9 thereafter. In order to qualify for the CBLR framework, a community banking organization must have a tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 8 , less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, and limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the CBLR framework and meets all requirements under the framework will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations and will not be required to report or calculate risk-based capital. The Company has not opted-in to the CBLR framework. 

As of September 30, 2024 the most recent notification from the FDIC has categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized the Bank must maintain ratios as set forth in the table. There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s category. Capital ratios of the Company are substantially the same as the Bank s. 

The FDIC, through formal or informal agreement, has the authority to require an institution to maintain higher capital ratios than those provided by statute, to be categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. 

The following table presents actual and required capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for the Bank under the Basel III Capital Rules. The minimum required capital amounts presented include the minimum required capital levels as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 202, based on the provisions of the Basel III Capital Rules. Capital levels required to be considered well capitalized are based upon prompt corrective action regulations, as amended to reflect the changes under the Basel III Capital Rules.

In accordance with the guidance, a hierarchy of valuation techniques is based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 based on these two types of inputs, are as follows: 

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 

Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 

The Company uses the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair values of the following assets: 

Securities available for sale: The fair values of securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices from a nationally recognized securities pricing agent. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted market prices for similar securities. 

Equity security at fair value: The Company s investment in an equity mutual fund is valued based on the net asset value of the fund, which is classified as Level 1. 

Other real estate owned OREO ): Nonrecurring fair value adjustments to OREO reflect full or partial write-downs that are based on the OREO s observable market price or current appraised value of the real estate. Since the market for OREO is not active, OREO subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments based on the current appraised value of the real estate are classified as Level 3. The appraised value is obtained annually from an independent third party appraiser and is reduced by expected sales costs, which has historically been of the appraised value. 

Collateral-dependent loans: Nonrecurring fair value adjustments to collateral-dependent loans reflect full or partial write-downs and reserves that are based on the collateral-dependent loan s observable market price or current appraised value of the collateral. Because the market for collateral-dependent loans is not active, such loans subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments based on the current appraised value of the collateral are classified as Level 3. The appraised value is obtained annually from an independent third party appraiser and is reduced by expected sales costs, which has historically been of the appraised value. 

Fair value hedges: The market value based on independent third party valuation sources that uses observable and traded prices of interest rate swaps from leading banks and brokers. 

The following table summarizes financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value:

Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc. 

Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc. is a Maryland corporation and a financial holding company registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company was incorporated on November 8, 2016 for the purpose of becoming the holding company of Farmers and Merchants Bank (the Bank in a share exchange transaction that was intended to constitute a tax-free exchange under Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Reorganization ). The Reorganization was consummated on November 1, 2016, at which time the Bank became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and all of the Bank s stockholders became stockholders of the Company by virtue of the conversion of their shares of common stock of the Bank into an equal number of shares of common stock of the Company. 

The Company s primary business activities are serving as the parent company of the Bank and holding a series investment in First Community Bankers Insurance Co., LLC, a Tennessee series limited liability company and licensed protected cell captive insurance company FCBI ). The Company owns 100 of one series of membership interests issued by FCBI, which series is deemed a protected cell under Tennessee law and has been designated Series Protected Cell FCB-4 (such series investment is hereinafter referred to as the Insurance Subsidiary ). 

- 38 -

The Bank is a Maryland commercial bank chartered on October 24, 1919 that is engaged in a general commercial and retail banking business. The Bank has had one inactive subsidiary, Reliable Community Financial Services, Inc., a Maryland corporation that was incorporated in April 1992 to facilitate the sale of fixed rate annuity products and later positioned to sell a full array of investment and insurance products. 

The Insurance Subsidiary represents one protected cell of a protected cell captive insurance company i.e. , FCBI) that was formed on November 9, 2016 to better manage our risk programs, provide insurance efficiencies, and add operating income by both keeping insurance premiums paid with respect to such risks within our affiliated group of entities and realizing certain tax benefits that are unique to captive insurance companies. The Company s investment in the Insurance Subsidiary represents one series of membership interests in FCBI. As a series limited liability company, FCBI is authorized by state law and its governing instruments to issue one or more series of membership interests, each of which, for all purposes under state law, is deemed to be a legal entity separate and apart from FCBI and its other series. 

Effective October 1, 2020, pursuant to a series of merger transactions, Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc. acquired Carroll Bancorp, Inc. Carroll and the Bank acquired Carroll s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Carroll Community Bank (collectively, the Merger ). 

The Company maintains an Internet site at www.fmb1919.bank on which it makes available, free of charge, its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to the foregoing as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. 

Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies 

This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. See Note 1 of the Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, which were included in Item 8 of Part II of the Form 10-K. On an on-going basis, management evaluates estimates, including those related to credit losses and intangible assets, impairment of investment securities, income taxes, and fair value of investments. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans represents management s estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on collateral dependent loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, consideration of current economic trends and conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the balance sheet. 

- 39 -

Management applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as most investment securities. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include loans, deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information. In addition to valuation, we must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that should be considered impaired or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statements of income. Examples include investment securities, goodwill and core deposit intangible, among others. 

Management does not believe that any material changes in our critical accounting policies have occurred since December 31, 2023. 

Financial Condition 

Total assets increased by 17,590,155, or 2.2 , to 817,530,981 at September 30, 2024 from 799,940,826 at December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was due primarily to an increase of 48,254,335 in loans, offset by a decrease of 27,848,470 in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease of 4,551,270 in debt securities. 

Total liabilities increased by 10,606,098, or 1.4 , to 758,368,633 at September 30, 2024 from 747,762,535 at December 31, 2023. The increase was due primarily to a 21,000,000 increase in advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the Reserve Bank ), offset by a 7,218,129 decrease in deposits, and a 3,874,997 decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements. 

Stockholders equity increased by 6,984,057, or 13.4 , to 59,162,348 at September 30, 2024 from 52,178,291 at December 31, 2023. The increase was due to net income of 3,421,643, a decrease of 4,151,691 in accumulated other comprehensive loss and an increase of 13,614 for stock-based compensation paid to an executive officer, offset by dividends paid, net of reinvestments, of 602,871.

Loans increased by 48,254,335, or 9.2 , to 571,562,379 at September 30, 2024 from 523,308,044 at December 31, 2023. The increase was due primarily to increases of 23,853,174 in commercial real estate loans, 18,108,751 in commercial loans, and 9,881,943 in construction/land development loans, offset by a decrease of 3,586,978 in residential real estate. The net increase is a result of the Company hiring several new loan officers over the last 18 months and opening a new loan production office. The Company s long term strategy is to increase the Commercial loan portfolio for a more diversified portfolio and reduce the concentration in commercial real estate loans. The allowance for credit losses on loans decreased by 94,365, or 2.2 , to 4,190,882 at September 30, 2024 from 4,285,247 at December 31, 2023. 

The Company has adopted policies and procedures that seek to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of the loan portfolio. These policies include underwriting standards for new credits as well as the continuous monitoring and reporting of asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans. These policies, coupled with continuous training efforts, have provided effective checks and balances for the risk associated with the lending process. Lending authority is based on the level of risk, size of the loan, and the experience of the lending officer. The Company s policy is to make the majority of its loan commitments in the market area it serves. Management believes that this tends to reduce risk because management is familiar with the credit histories of loan applicants and has in-depth knowledge of the risk to which a given credit is subject. Although the loan portfolio is diversified, its performance will be influenced by the economy of the region.

Watch list loans include loans classified as Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 8,133,178 of loans on a watch list, other than collateral-dependent loans, for which the borrowers have the potential for experiencing financial difficulties. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 8,340,746 of such loans. Watch List loans are subject to ongoing management attention and their classifications are reviewed regularly. 

Management believes that the 4.2 million reserve at September 30, 2024 is adequate to cover the expected losses in the loan portfolio. The Company s loan portfolio grew by 48.2 million during the first nine months of 2024. The allowance for credit losses on loans was 0.72 of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.81 at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the percentage is due primarily to a 152,449 fully reserved loan being charged off and removed from the reserve and a decrease in the reserve required for multi-family loans due to no historical losses incurred by the Company in that segment and the improvement of the qualitative factors for that segment. 

The reserve for held to maturity securities was 36,894 at September 30, 2024, 126,631 at June 30, 2024 and 35,627 at December 31, 2023. It has vacillated significantly from quarter to quarter due to the unrated portion of the bond portfolio where the projected life is the most significant factor in determining the reserve. The unrated bonds have a call provision at the option of the issuer. The level of interest rates at quarter end determines if the bonds are projected to be called which shortens the projected life of the bonds significantly. If rates are at a level that a call is not projected, the bonds are assumed to reach maturity which significantly lengthens the projected life. 

Investment Securities 

Investments in debt securities decreased by 4,551,270, or 2.5 , to 177,697,025 at September 30, 2024 from 184,248,295 at December 31, 2023. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had classified 89 of the investment portfolio as available for sale. The balance of the portfolio was classified as held to maturity. 

- 42 -

Securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions as part of the Company s asset/liability management strategy. Available for sale debt securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of income taxes. Securities classified as held to maturity, which the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost. The Company records unrealized gains and losses on equity securities in earnings. The Company does not currently follow a strategy of making security purchases with a view to near-term sales, and, therefore, does not own trading securities. The Company manages the investment portfolio within policies that seek to achieve desired levels of liquidity, manage interest rate sensitivity, meet earnings objectives, and provide required collateral for deposit and borrowing activities. 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises and equipment increased by 857,719 to 7,441,171 at September 30, 2024 from 6,583,452 at December 31, 2023 due primarily to the renovations made to the Upperco, Maryland location after significant storm damage in 2022 and the leasehold improvements made to the new Towson, Maryland location. 

Other Real Estate Owned 

Other real estate owned OREO at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included one property. The property is an apartment building in Baltimore, Maryland that was acquired in the Merger. The property is being marketed for sale.

Other assets increased by 1,070,270 to 7,009,579 at September 30, 2024 from 5,939,309 at December 31, 2023 due primarily capitalized conversion costs in connection with the core system conversion occurring in 2024 and the increase in right of use assets due to the lease of the new Towson, Maryland location. 

Deposits 

Total deposits decreased by 7,218,129, or 1.1 , to 673,744,722 at September 30, 2024 from 680,962,851 at December 31, 2023. The decrease in deposits was due primarily to a 20,280,610 decrease in interest-bearing checking accounts, a 6,037,013 decrease in money market accounts, a 10,497,961 decrease in savings accounts and a 6,842,403 decrease in noninterest-bearing checking accounts, offset by a 36,439,858 increase in certificates of deposit. Generally, the decreases are due to the competition for deposits among all financial institutions due to higher interest rates.

Liquidity Management 

Liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations that arise out of the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet depositor withdrawal requirements, to fund loans, and to fund our other debts and obligations as they come due in the normal course of business. We maintain our asset liquidity position internally through short-term investments, the maturity distribution of the investment portfolio, loan repayments, and income from earning assets. On the liability side of the balance sheet, liquidity is affected by the timing of maturing liabilities and the ability to generate new deposits or borrowings as needed. 

The Bank is approved to borrow 75 of eligible pledged single-family residential loans and 50 of eligible pledged commercial loans as well as investment securities, or approximately 71.0 million under a secured line of credit with the FHLB. The Bank also has two facilities with the Reserve Bank. Under the first facility, which has been in place for over 10 years and is collateralized by loans, the Bank can borrow approximately 36.6 million. The second facility is the Bank Term Funding Program BTFP that the Reserve Bank created in 2023. The BTFP facility allows securities to be pledged at par, provides fixed rates for up to one-year terms, and allows prepayments in whole or in part at any time. Effective, March 11, 2024, no new advances are available under the BTFP facility. Finally, the Bank has 23,500,000 14,500,000 unsecured and 9,000,000 secured) of overnight federal funds lines of credit available from commercial banks. 

FHLB advances of 5,000,000 were outstanding as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. BTFP advances of 54,000,000 and 33,000,000 were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company borrowed 17,000,000 to facilitate the Merger in 2020 as more fully described below. There were no borrowings from the Reserve Bank other than the BTFP advances noted above or our commercial bank lenders at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Management believes that we have adequate liquidity sources to meet all anticipated liquidity needs over the next 12 months. Management knows of no trend or event which is likely to have a material impact on our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels. Uninsured deposits were approximately 138,773,000, or 21 of total deposits, at September 30, 2024. 

Borrowings and Other Contractual Obligations 

The Company s contractual obligations consist primarily of borrowings and operating leases for various facilities. 

On September 30, 2020, the Company borrowed 17,000,000 from First Horizon Bank FHN for the purpose of funding a portion of the consideration that was payable to the stockholders of Carroll in the Merger. Net of issuance costs, the amount of the net long-term debt was 11,799,931 and 13,212,378 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The loan matures on September 30, 2025. The interest rate on the loan is fixed at 4.10 . Quarterly interest-only payments were made through October 1, 2021. During the remaining term of the loan, the Company is required to make quarterly interest and principal payments of approximately 600,000, based on a nine-year straight-line amortization schedule. The remaining balance of approximately 9,916,667 will be due at maturity. To secure its obligations under this loan, the Company pledged all of its shares of common stock of the Bank to FHN. 

- 44 -

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent overnight borrowings from customers. Securities owned by the Company which are used as collateral for these borrowings are primarily U.S. government agency securities.

Loan commitments and lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition to the contract. Loan commitments generally have interest rates at current market amounts, fixed expiration dates, and may require payment of a fee. Lines of credit generally have variable interest rates. Such lines do not represent future cash requirements because it is unlikely that all customers will draw upon their lines in full at any time. Letters of credit are commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. 

The maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of the commitment. Loan commitments, lines of credit and letters of credit are made on the same terms, including collateral, as outstanding loans. Management is not aware of any accounting loss that is likely to be incurred as a result of funding its credit commitments. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The net yield on interest earning assets decreased to 2.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.04 for the same period of 2023. Higher interest expense on deposits and borrowings was the driving factor in the lower net interest income. The Federal Reserve rate increases of 4.75 since March 2022 caused the cost of deposits and borrowings to increase significantly. 

- 46 -

Total interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 28,092,282 compared to 22,438,448 for the same period of 2023, an increase of 5,653,834, or 25.2 . 

Total interest income on loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 2,997,928 when compared to the same period of 2023 due to a 18.5 million higher average loan balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period of 2023 and a higher loan yield of 5.36 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 4.79 for the same period of 2023.

The average balance of total interest-earning assets increased by 62.7 million to 775.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 713.2 million for the same period of 2023. 

Total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 12,699,814 compared to 6,323,561 for the same period of 2023, an increase of 6,376,253, or 100.8 . The increase was due to a 69.9 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities to 624.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 554.6 million for the same period of 2023, and a higher overall cost of funds on interest bearing deposits and borrowings of 2.71 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.52 for the same period of 2023. Cost of funds for time deposits increased to 4.30 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.67 for the same period of 2023.

Provision for Credit Losses 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a provision for credit losses on loans of 43,414 and a provision for held to maturity securities of 1,267, offset by a recovery for unfunded loan commitments of 44,681, resulted in a net provision of 0. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a recovery for credit losses on loans of 594,116 and a recovery for unfunded loan commitments of 15,939, offset by a provision for held to maturity securities of 40,055, resulted in a net recovery of 570,000. The recovery of credit losses on loans was due primarily to a recovery of 381,000 from loans charged off over 10 years ago which also resulted in lower historical losses and a significant decrease in the required reserve for loans. 

- 48 -

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,329,395 compared to 1,168,890 for the same period of 2023, an increase of 160,505, or 13.7 . The increase was due primarily to an increase of 142,794 on insurance proceeds from the storm damage to the Bank s Upperco, Maryland location. 

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 12,306,951 compared to 11,189,030 for the same period of 2023, an increase of 1,117,921, or 10.0 . The increase was due primarily to an increase in salaries and benefits of 317,909 as a result of hiring several new employees, primarily in the commercial loan production department and normal annual salary increases, an increase in other expenses of 488,857, and an increase in occupancy and furniture and equipment costs of 311,155. The increase in other expenses was due primarily to increases in costs related to the upcoming core conversion, ATM related expenses, legal fees incurred for stockholder matters, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments. The increase in occupancy and furniture and equipment was due primarily to the renovations and new equipment for the Upperco, Maryland location which was placed in service at the end of the first quarter and the new Towson, Maryland location that was placed in service during the second quarter. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 993,289 compared to 1,661,640 for the same period of 2023. The effective tax rate was 22.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 24.9 for the same period of 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to a higher percentage of tax exempt revenue in 2024 versus 2023. 

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

General 

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,123,127 compared to 1,432,139 for the same period of 2023. The decrease of 309,012, or 21.6 , was due to a 102,144 decrease in net interest income, a 325,275 increase in noninterest expense, a 75,000 decrease in the recovery of credit losses, offset by a 67,794 increase in noninterest income and a 125,613 decrease in income taxes. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income was 5,084.845 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5,186,989 for the same period of 2023. The net yield on interest earning assets decreased to 2.62 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.88 for the same period of 2023. Higher interest expense on deposits and borrowings was the driving factor in the lower net interest income. The Federal Reserve rate increases of 4.75 since March 2022 caused the cost of deposits and borrowings to increase significantly. 

Total interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 9,846,452 compared to 8,001,697 for the same period of 2023, an increase of 1,844,755, or 23.1 . 

- 49 -

Total interest income on loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1,292,470 when compared to the same period of 2023 due to a 36.3 million higher average loan balance for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period of 2023 and a higher loan yield of 5.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 4.98 for the same period of 2023. Investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 534,769, or 43.5 , when compared to the same period of 2023 due to an increase in the fully-taxable equivalent yield to 3.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.78 for the same period of 2023, and a 17.9 million higher average investment balance. The fully-taxable equivalent yield on total interest-earning assets increased 63 basis points to 5.05 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.42 for the same period of 2023. The average balance of total interest-earning assets increased by 55.0 million to 782.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 727.9 million for the same period of 2023. 

Total interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,761,607 compared to 2,814,708 for the same period of 2023, an increase of 1,946,899, or 69.2 . The increase was due to a 63.9 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities to 635.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 571.7 million for the same period of 2023, and a higher overall cost of funds on interest bearing deposits and borrowings of 3.00 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.97 for the same period of 2023. Cost of funds for time deposits increased to 4.54 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.28 for the same period of 2023. Cost of funds attributable to long-term debt and FHLB, Reserve Bank and other borrowings increased to 4.49 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.67 for the same period of 2023. 

Average noninterest-earning assets increased by 6.7 million to 24.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.8 million in the same period of 2023. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by 11.3 million to 106.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 118.0 million in the same period of 2023.

Provision for Credit Losses 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, a provision for credit losses on loans of 102,784, offset by a recovery for held to maturity securities of 89,737 and a recovery for unfunded loan commitments of 13,047, resulted in a net provision of 0. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, a recovery for credit losses on loans of 136,434, offset by a provision for held to maturity securities of 41,600 and a provision for unfunded loan commitments of 19,834, resulted in a net recovery of 75,000. 

- 51 -

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 451,020 compared to 383,226 for the same period of 2023, an increase of 67.794, or 17.7 . The increase was due primarily to a 33,577 increase in the unrealized gain on equity securities. 

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 4,071,223 compared to 3,745,948 for the same period of 2023, an increase of 325,275, or 8.9 . The increase was due primarily to an increase in employee benefits of 200,844 as a result of higher supplemental executive retirement plan costs, and an increase in occupancy and furniture and equipment costs of 125,747. The increase in occupancy and furniture and equipment was due primarily to the renovations and new equipment for the Upperco location which was placed in service at the end of the first quarter and the new Towson location that was placed in service during the second quarter. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 341,515 compared to 467.128 for the same period of 2023. The effective tax rate was 23.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 24.6 for the same period of 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to a higher percentage of tax exempt revenue in 2024 versus 2023. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc. is a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and, accordingly, is not required to include the information required by this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act with the SEC, such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in those rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc. s principal executive officer PEO and the principal financial officer PFO ), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

An evaluation of the effectiveness of these disclosure controls as of September 30, 2024 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the PEO and the PFO. Based on that evaluation, management, including the PEO and the PFO, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are, in fact, effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

- 52 -

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Part II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

None. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

The risks and uncertainties to which our financial condition and operations are subject are discussed in detail in Item 1A of Part I of the Form 10-K. Management does not believe that any material changes in our risk factors have occurred since they were last disclosed except as follows: 

The Company is subject to risks from a proxy contest and/or the actions of activist stockholders. 

In a document filed with the SEC by Barry and Carol Renbaum on July 8, 2024, the Renbaums stated that they intend to nominate up to three candidates for election to the Company s Board of Directors at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders. A proxy contest or related activities on the part of the Renbaums or other activist stockholders could adversely affect our business for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, the following: 

Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees; 

Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners, customers and others important to our success, any of which could negatively affect our business and our results of operations and financial condition; and 

Our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plans and/or to realize long-term value from our assets could be adversely affected if nominees advanced by activist stockholders are elected or appointed to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, and that could in turn have an adverse effect on our business and on our results of operations and financial condition. 

Proxy contests may cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility. Further, if a proxy contest results in a change in control of our Board of Directors, then such an event could subject us to risks relating to certain third parties' rights under our existing contractual obligations, which could adversely affect our business. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

None.
