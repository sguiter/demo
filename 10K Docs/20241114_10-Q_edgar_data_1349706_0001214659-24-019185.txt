Revenue and Gross (Loss) Profit 

During the
three-month period ended September 30, 2024, we had increased revenues of 124,000 and increased gross profits of 647,000 compared to
the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased sales of approximately 217,000 from two
of our higher margin defense industry customers, somewhat offset by a decrease in sales from one of our medical customers during the three-month
period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit during the
three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was also impacted by a reduction in obsolete inventory expenses of 450,000 compared to the
three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net Loss and Operating Expenses 

During the
three months ended September 30, 2024, our net loss decreased by 539,000 compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023,
primarily due to the increase in gross profit as described above somewhat offset by an increase in payroll expense of 147,000 compared
to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Net Loss available to common shareholders 

The Company amended and restated its certificate of designations of
rights and preferences of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. Pursuant to the Series A Amendment, the holder of the preferred
stock, which is a related party, waived all accrued and future dividends in exchange for an increase in the liquidation preference to
125 . 

The waived dividends resulted in a decrease in
accrued preferred dividends for the three months ended September 30,2024 of 511,000 compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023.

Revenue and Gross (Loss) Profit 

D uring the nine-months ended September
30, 2024, we had increased revenues of 985,000 and increased gross profits of 1,465,000 compared to the nine-month period ended September
30, 2023, primarily due to increased sales of approximately 1,085,000 from our higher margin
defense industry customers, somewhat offset by decreased sales of 236,000 to one of our medical customers during the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, was also impacted by a reduction in obsolete inventory expenses of 696,000 compared to the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023 . 

Net Loss and Operating Expenses 

During the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net loss decreased by 1,859,000 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023,
primarily due to the increase in gross profit as described above as well as by decreased legal expenses of 443,00 0, decreased
marketing expenses of 132,000, and decreased consulting and audit expenses of 97,000 somewhat offset by an increase in salaries and
benefits of 266,000 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

15 

Net Loss available to common shareholders 

The waived dividends resulted in a decrease in accrued preferred dividends
for the nine months ended September 30,2024 of 556,000 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We have incurred recurring net losses and operations have not provided
sufficient cash flows. We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we begin
significant deliveries of our products. Our inability to continue as a going concern could have a negative impact on our Company, including
our ability to obtain needed financing. In view of these matters, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. We intend to finance our future development activities and its working capital needs largely through the sale of equity securities
with some additional funding from other sources, including term notes until such time as funds provided by operations are sufficient to
fund working capital requirements. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to
continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 0.0 million and negative working capital of
 4.9 million. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements
are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The accounting principles we use require
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical
accounting policies; however, materially different amounts may be reported under different conditions or using assumptions different from
those that we have applied. The accounting policies that have been identified as critical to our business operations and to understanding
the results of our operations pertain to the valuation of inventories and accruals of certain liabilities. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Our management has considered all recent accounting
pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. Our management believes that these recent pronouncements will
not have a significant effect on our financial statements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Because we are a smaller reporting company, this section is not applicable. 

16 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of September 30, 2024, our management, with
the participation and supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). The term disclosure controls and procedures, 
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. Based upon their evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, solely as
a result of the material weaknesses identified by management and described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
to ensure that material information relating to the Company required to be disclosed by the Company in reports we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and to ensure
that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Material Weaknesses 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB Audit Standard No. 5, in internal
control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses, which have
caused management to conclude that as of September 30 , 2023, our internal control over financial
reporting ICFR was not effective at the reasonable assurance level: 

We
do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricts our ability to gather, analyze and properly review information
related to financial reporting, including fair value estimates, in a timely manner. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting
duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions,
the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. The company s primary user
access controls to ensure appropriate authorization and segregation of duties that would adequately restrict user and privileged access
to the financially relevant systems and data to appropriate personnel were not designed and/or implemented effectively; 

The
insufficient resources in our accounting function also resulted in a deficiency over design and implementation of effective revenue recognition
policies, procedures and controls with respect to the identification, timing and treatment of various new contracts with customers; 

Management
also concluded that there was a deficiency in internal controls over financial reporting relating to the accounting treatment for complex
financial instruments which resulted in the failure to properly account for such instruments, specifically with respect to the classification
and proper accounting treatment of preferred shares; and 

Lastly,
we did not design and maintain effective controls associated with related party transactions and disclosures. The controls in place were
not designed at a sufficient level of precision or rigor to effectively prepare and review the complete financial records in such manner
as to identify and properly disclose the nature and financial data of all our related party relationships. 

Management evaluated the impact of our failure
to have segregation of duties and proper reviews, inadequacy in design of revenue recognition policies and procedures, failure to properly
account for and provide adequate disclosures of complex financial instruments, fair value estimate procedures and reviews, and deficiency
in identification and a disclosure of related party transactions and concluded that the multiple control deficiencies that resulted represented
material weaknesses. 

We have begun to implement the actions below (including
appropriate staffing to execute such actions) in the following areas to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting in an
effort to remediate the material weaknesses. 

17 

Remediation 

Inventory . We have enhanced the design
of existing controls and implemented new controls over the accounting, processing and recording of inventory. Specifically, we have strengthened
the design of the management review control over inventory-in-transit. We have implemented processes to ensure timely identification and
evaluation of inventory cut-off, and we are requiring additional accountability from counterparties on the accuracy of incoming and outgoing
shipment documentation. We have deployed information system enhancements and have made better use of current system capabilities in order
to improve the accuracy of inventory cut-off, reporting and reconciliation. In addition, we have been creating an assembly bill of materials BOM in our business software to facilitate efficient and accurate manufacturing and provide proper recording of raw materials
inventory. The BOM structure ultimately minimizes inventory inaccuracies and production delays, and we have been increasing cycle counting
of inventory used in production to improve accuracy. Lastly, we have recently hired a material specialist whose responsibility is to maintain
inventory records. 

Revenue Recognition . We intend on enhancing
the design of existing controls and implementing new controls over the review of the application and recording of revenue for customer
contracts under the guidance outlined in ASC 606. We also intend on implementing more thorough reviews of contracts by evaluating contractual
terms and determining whether certain contracts should be consolidated, involve related parties and the proper timing of revenue recognition.
These reviews will include more comprehensive contractual analysis from our legal team while ensuring qualified resources are involved
and adequate oversight is performed during the internal technical accounting review process. 

Accounts Receivable . We intend on enhancing
the design of existing controls and implementing new controls over the processing and review of accounts receivable billings. We plan
to supplement our accounting staff with more experienced personnel. We will also evaluate information system capabilities in order to
reduce the manual calculations within this business process. 

Complex Financial Instruments. We will
design and implement controls to properly identify and implement the proper accounting treatment and classifications of our complex financial
instruments to ensure our equity accounting and treatment is in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We intend
to accomplish this by implementing more thorough reviews of certain details regarding all rights, penalties, record holders and negative
covenants of the financial instruments in order to apply the correct accounting guidance (liabilities vs. equity vs. temporary equity). 

Fair Value Estimates . We will design and
implement additional control activities to ensure controls related to fair value estimates (including controls that validate the reasonableness,
completeness and accuracy of information, data and assumptions), are properly designed, implemented and documented. 

While these actions and planned actions are subject
to ongoing management evaluation and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls
over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles, we are committed to the continuous improvement of our internal control over financial
reporting. We will continue to diligently review our internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were
no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected,
or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

The Company is currently
involved in litigation arising from matters in the ordinary course of business. We are regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory
and government investigations, and other proceedings involving labor and employment, commercial disputes, and other matters. Such claims,
suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil penalties, or other adverse consequences. 

Certain of these outstanding
matters include speculative or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record an undiscounted liability for contingent losses, including future
legal costs, settlements and judgments, when we consider it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose
the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously
accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is
required to determine both likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of loss related to such matters. 

With respect to our outstanding
matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually
or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.
