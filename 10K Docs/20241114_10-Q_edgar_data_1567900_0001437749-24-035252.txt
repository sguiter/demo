Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties described herein and actual results may differ materially from those included within the forward-looking statements. Additional factors are described in our other public reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revision of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

This Report contains certain estimates and plans related to us and the industry in which we operate, which assume certain events, trends and activities will occur and the projected information based on those assumptions.

The Company has executed a share exchange agreement with Evtec Aluminium Limited Evtec Aluminium ), whereby the Company expects to acquire all of the issued and outstanding share capital of Evtec Aluminium with the result of Evtec Aluminium becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Exchange ). The Exchange will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition with Evtec Aluminium being the accounting acquiror. The Company believes that the Exchange with Evtec Aluminium will attract additional capital investment as Evtec Aluminium is substantially larger than Blackbox and has a strong acquisition pipeline. Management has also implemented a number of initiatives aimed at improving operating cash flow including, new product development, revised marketing strategies and expense reductions. In addition, the Company has historically been able to raise debt or equity financing to meet its capital needs and is also evaluating strategic alternatives with respect to possible mergers or acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the Company s operational changes will impact its cash flow or if it will be able to raise additional capital or on what terms or if it will be able to execute the planned Exchange with Evtec Aluminium. 

The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation.

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in assumption of the continuation of the Company as a going concern, which is dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain sufficient financing or establish itself as a profitable business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred an operating loss of 2,452,989 and a net loss of 2,522,487. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred an operating loss of 5,297,671 and a net loss of 4,664,455. Cash flows used in operations were 681,353 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 3,166,067 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company has cash of 60,921 as of September 30, 2024.These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has executed a share exchange agreement with Evtec Aluminium Limited Evtec Aluminium ), whereby the Company expects to acquire all of the issued and outstanding share capital of Evtec Aluminium with the result of Evtec Aluminium becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Exchange ). The Exchange will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition with Evtec Aluminium being the accounting acquiror. The Company believes that the merger with Evtec Aluminium will attract additional capital investment as Evtec Aluminium is substantially larger than Blackbox and has a strong acquisition pipeline. Management has also implemented a number of initiatives aimed at improving operating cash flow including, new product development, revised marketing strategies and expense reductions. In addition, the Company has historically been able to raise debt or equity financing to meet its capital needs and is also evaluating strategic alternatives with respect to possible mergers or acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the Company s operational changes will impact its cash flow or if it will be able to raise additional capital or on what terms or if it will be able to execute the planned acquisition of Evtec Aluminium. 

The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation. 

Significant Accounting Policies 

There have been no changes from the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2024, we had cash and marketable securities totaling 60,921 as compared to cash and marketable securities totaling 475,652 at December 31, 2023. Our cash flows used in operations were 681,353 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3,199,362 for the same period in the prior year. 

Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 1,096,697 as compared to cash provided by investing activities of 3,273,886 for the prior year period. The decrease in the cash flow from investing activities was due to the liquidation of marketable securities in order to fund the Company s operations during the prior year, combined with the issuance of a note receivable in the current year. The volume of marketable securities includes trading activity in a Company account that was used to research and test specific trading techniques although the account held less than 100,000. We do not expect capital expenditures to be significant for the remainder of 2024. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was 1,366,274 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 36,814 for the prior year period. The increase in financing activities was the result of proceeds from the sale of common stock and funding from merchant cash advances.

As noted above, the Company intends to pursue the planned acquisition transaction with Evtec Aluminium however there can be no assurance that it will be able to complete the transaction or that such a transaction will provide the Company with sufficient liquidity to fund its operations. In addition, the Company may need to raise additional debt or equity capital in order to fund its operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so or on acceptable terms. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Evtec Aluminium advanced the Company 1,043,000 in financial support. Evtec Aluminium is not contractually required to provide any additional support and there can be no assurance that they may do so. 

Results of Operations 

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue was 646,792, as compared to 727,218, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in revenue of 11 was due to fewer subscribers in the current year that was partially offset by higher average revenue per subscriber. Average subscribers for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 2,972 as compared to 3,174 for the prior year period. Average monthly revenue per subscriber was 72.55 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 76.37 in the prior year period. 

Cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were 293,842 and 327,928, resulting in gross margins of 55 for both periods. The primary components of cost of revenues include costs related to data and news feed expenses for exchange information which comprise the majority of the costs, as well as the costs for program moderators. The gross margin percentage is expected to remain between 45 and 55 . 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses were 1,088,582 as compared to 1,269,769 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 181,187 or 14 . We significantly reduced expenditures in software development costs, advertising and marketing and selling, general and administrative expenses for the 2024 period. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 957,372 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 891,282 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 66,090 or 7 . The decrease was primarily driven by lower stock-based compensation expense which was partially offset by higher professional fees associated with the pending Exchange with Evtec Aluminum. Advertising and marketing expenses decreased by 34,741 or 27 from 127,632 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 92,891 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as the Company continues to reposition its marketing strategy. Software development costs decreased by 71,792 or 41 from 173,665 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 101,873 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decreased software development costs reflected lower development costs for our new product, Stock Nanny. 

Our loss from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 734,166 as compared to a loss from operations of 869,229 for the prior year period. The improvement in the loss from operations was driven by lower operating expenses and was partially offset by the lower sales. 

Comparison of Nine months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue was 1,981,974, as compared to 2,324,870, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in revenue of 15 was due to fewer subscribers in the current year that was partially offset by higher average revenue per subscriber. Average subscribers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 2,986 as compared to 3,564 for the prior year period. Average monthly revenue per subscriber was 73.66 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 72.24 in the prior year period. 

Cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were 1,007,401 and 1,202,534, resulting in gross margins of 49 and 48 , respectively. The primary components of cost of revenues include costs related to data and news feed expenses for exchange information which comprise the majority of the costs, as well as the costs for program moderators. The gross margin percentage is expected to remain between 45 and 55 . 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses were 3,429,812 as compared to 5,369,668 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 1,939,856 or 36 . We significantly reduced expenditures in software development costs, advertising and marketing and selling general and administrative expenses for the 2024 period. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 4,085,384 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2,735,480 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1,349,904 or 33 . The decrease was primarily driven by lower stock-based compensation expense which was partially offset by higher professional fees associated with the pending Exchange with Evtec Aluminum. Advertising and marketing expenses decreased by 158,751 or 32 from 496,028 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 337,277 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as the Company continues to reposition its marketing strategy.

The decreased software development costs reflected lower development costs for our new product Stock Nanny. 

Our loss from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 2,452,989 as compared to a loss from operations of 4,247,332 for the prior year period. The improvement in the loss from operations was driven by lower operating expenses and was partially offset by the lower sales.

EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) 

We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). However, management believes the presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company s financial condition and results of operations, and that when GAAP financial measures are viewed in conjunction with the non-GAAP financial measures, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of the Company s ongoing operating performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among the primary indicators management uses (i) to compare operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) for planning purposes including the preparation of its internal annual operating budget and (iii) as a basis for evaluating performance. For all non-GAAP financial measures in this release, we have provided corresponding GAAP financial measures for comparative purposes in the report. 

EBITDA is defined by us as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization expense and certain non-cash. EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and therefore should not be considered in isolation nor construed as an alternative to operating profit, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of liquidity. Moreover, since EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP, and thus is susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA:

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and as such, we are not required to provide the information required under this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Gust Kepler, our principal executive officer and Robert Winspear, our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Such disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Our disclosure controls and procedures provide our principal executive officer and principal financial officer with reasonable assurances that our disclosure controls and procedures will achieve their objectives. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting can or will prevent all human error. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Furthermore, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are internal resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be weighed relative to their corresponding costs. Because of the limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide complete assurance that all control issues and instances of error, if any, within our company are detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur due to human error or mistake. Additionally, controls, no matter how well designed, could be circumvented by the individual acts of specific persons within the organization. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated objectives under all potential future conditions.
