Item
2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

References
to the Company, our, us or we refer to Bowen Acquisition Corp. The following
discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited
financial statements and the notes related thereto. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes
forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a
result of many factors. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. While we intend
to focus our search on businesses in Asia, we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating
an initial business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our
behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. We intend to effectuate
our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private units, the proceeds
of the sale of our securities in connection with our initial business combination, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, stock and
debt. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception through September 30,
2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the IPO described below and identifying a target company for our
initial Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business
Combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after the IPO. We
expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing
compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a Business Combination. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 825,358, which consists of loss of 127,429 derived from
operating costs including legal and professional service expense offset by income earned on Trust Account of 952,787. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 2,428,474, which consists of loss of 389,655 derived from
operating costs including legal and professional service expense offset by income earned on Trust Account of 2,818,129. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 573,443, which consists of loss of 187,428 derived from
formation and operating costs offset by income earned on Trust Account of 760,871. 

For
the period from February 17, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 570,338, which consists of loss of
 190,533 derived from formation and operating costs offset by income earned on Trust Account of 760,871. 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

On
July 14, 2023, we consummated our IPO of Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 60,000,000. Simultaneously with the
closing of our IPO, we consummated the sale of 330,000 Private Placement Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit in a private
placement to the Sponsors, generating total gross proceeds of 3,300,000. 

On
July 17, 2023, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full to purchase 900,000 Units. As a result, on July 18, 2023,
we sold an additional 900,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 9,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the
full exercise of the over-allotment option, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 31,500 Private Placement Units, at a purchase
price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of 315,000. Transaction costs amounted to 3,318,898 consisting
of 1,725,000 of cash underwriting fees and 1,593,898 of other offering costs. 

21 

Following
the closing of the IPO and the sale of over-allotment units, an amount of 69,690,000 10.10 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the
sale of the Units in the IPO and the Private Placement was placed in a trust account. The funds held in the Trust Account may be invested
in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust
account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, to complete our initial business combination. To the
extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the
remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses,
make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

Prior
to the completion of our initial business combination, we have available to us the approximately 700,000 of proceeds held outside the
trust account. We will use these funds primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective
target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives
or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business
combination, and to pay taxes to the extent the interest earned on the trust account is not sufficient to pay our taxes. 

We
do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating
our business. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence
and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available
to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete
our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of
our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 271,847 and a working capital of 12,879. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to
incur significant professional costs to remain as a public traded company and to incur transaction costs in pursuit of a Business Combination.
In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management believes
that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, if the Company
is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and such period is not extended, there will be a liquidation
and subsequent dissolution. As a result, management has determined that such additional condition also raises substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statement does not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of the uncertainty.

Other
Contractual Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities reflected on our balance
sheet. 

Registration
Rights 

The
holders of the Founder Shares, EBC founder shares, Private Placement Units will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration
rights agreement dated July 11, 2023 requiring the Company to register such securities for resale. Subject to certain limitations set
forth in such agreement, the holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration
demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights
with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to
register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides
that the Company will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until
the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection
with the filing of any such registration statements. 

Business
Combination Marketing Agreement 

We
have engaged EBC as an advisor in connection with its Business Combination to assist in holding meetings with the Company stockholders
to discuss the potential Business Combination and the target business attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors
that are interested in purchasing its securities in connection with its initial Business Combination and assist with press releases and
public filings in connection with the Business Combination. The Company will pay EBC a service fee for such services upon the consummation
of its initial Business Combination in an amount equal to 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the IPO. In addition, the Company will pay EBC
a service fee in an amount equal to 1.0 of the total consideration payable in the initial Business Combination if it introduces the
Company to the target business with whom it completes an initial Business Combination and the amount will be payable in cash and is due
at the closing date of the initial Business Combination. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during
the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates
and all the significant accounting policies are described in the Note 2 of this reviewed consolidated financial statements. 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on our financial statements.

Item
3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

Item
4 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective due solely to the material weakness in our internal control
over financial reporting related to the Company s lack of qualified SEC reporting professional. As a result, we performed additional
analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Accordingly, management
believes that the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, result
of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Management intends to continue implement remediation steps to improve our disclosure
controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we intend to expand and improve our review process
for complex securities and related accounting standards. We have improved this process by enhancing access to accounting literature,
identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional
staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
