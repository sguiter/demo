Value Creation Initiative s 
 Beginning in 2022, in order to create capacity to fund growth and investment in our Medicare Advantage business and further expansion of our healthcare services capabilities, we committed to drive additional value for the enterprise through cost saving, productivity initiatives, and value acceleration from previous investments. As a result of these initiatives, we recorded charges, primarily in asset impairments, of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 within operating costs in the condensed consolidated statements of income. These charges were recorded at the corporate level and not allocated to the segments. We expect to incur additional charges through the end of 2024.

 At September 30, 2024, accounts receivable related to services were million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, services revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods, such as due to changes in transaction price, was not material. Further, services revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations was not material. 
 
 of the fair value of the investment securities on loan. The fair value of the loaned investment securities is monitored on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as the fair value of the loaned investment securities fluctuates. The collateral, which may be in the form of cash or U.S. Government securities, is deposited by the borrower with an independent lending agent. Any cash collateral, which is reinvested by the lending agent primarily in short-term, highly liquid investments, is recorded as a securities lending collateral asset within other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. We record a corresponding liability to reflect our obligation to return the collateral within trade accounts payable and accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. Collateral received in the form of securities is not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets because, absent default by the borrower, we do not have the right to sell, pledge or otherwise reinvest securities collateral. Loaned securities continue to be carried as investment securities on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. Earnings on the invested cash collateral, net of expense, associated with the securities lending payable are recorded as investment income.

 We participate in a securities lending program where we loan certain investment securities for short periods of time in exchange for collateral, consisting of cash or U.S. Government securities, initially equal to at least of the fair value of the investment securities on loan. Collateral with a fair value of million was held at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, collateral from lending our investment securities has been reinvested in short-term, highly liquid assets. In addition, we participated in non-cash securities lending with a fair value of million at September 30, 2024.

 Approximately of our debt securities were investment-grade quality, with a weighted average credit rating of AA- by Standard Poor's Rating Service, or S P, at September 30, 2024. Our remaining debt securities below investment-grade were primarily rated B+, the higher end of the below investment-grade rating scale. Tax-exempt municipal securities were diversified among general obligation bonds of states and local municipalities in the United States as well as special revenue bonds issued by municipalities to finance specific public works projects such as utilities, water and sewer, transportation, or education. Our general obligation bonds are diversified across the United States with no individual state exceeding approximately of our total debt securities. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. 
 Our unrealized losses from all debt securities were generated from approximately positions out of a total of approximately positions at September 30, 2024. All issuers of debt securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at September 30, 2024 remain current on all contractual payments. After taking into account these and other factors previously described, we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets since the time these debt securities were purchased.

 Interest Rate Swaps 
 
 We have entered into interest-rate swap agreements with major financial institutions to convert our interest-rate exposure on some of our senior notes payable from fixed rates to variable rates, based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), to align interest costs more closely with floating interest rates received on our cash equivalents and investment securities. These swap agreements were qualified and designated as a fair value hedge. Our interest rate swaps are recognized in other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value as of the reporting date. Our interest rate swaps are highly effective at reflecting the fair value of our hedged fixed rate senior notes payable. We utilize market-based financing rates, forward yield curves and discount rates in determining fair value of these swaps at each reporting date, a Level 2 measure within the fair value hierarchy. The cumulative, aggregate adjustment to the carrying value of the senior notes was approximately million at September 30, 2024. The swap asset, included within other long-term assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet was approximately million at September 30, 2024. The swap asset, included within other long-term assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, was approximately million at December 31, 2023. We include the gain or loss on the swap agreements in interest expense on our condensed consolidated income statement, the same line item as the offsetting loss or gain on the related senior notes. The gain or loss due to hedge ineffectiveness was not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 billion at September 30, 2024 and billion at December 31, 2023. The fair value of our senior notes debt was billion at September 30, 2024 and billion at December 31, 2023. The fair value of our senior notes debt is determined based on Level 2 inputs, including quoted market prices for the same or similar debt, or if no quoted market prices are available, on the current prices estimated to be available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Carrying value approximates fair value for our commercial paper borrowings. We had outstanding commercial paper borrowings at September 30, 2024. The commercial paper borrowings were billion at December 31, 2023. 
 Put and Call Options Measured at Fair Value 
 Our put and call options associated with our equity method investments are measured at fair value each period using a Monte Carlo simulation. 
 The put and call options fair values associated with our Primary Care Organization strategic partnership with Welsh, Carson, Anderson Stowe, or WCAS, which are exercisable at a fixed revenue exit multiple and provide a minimum return on WCAS' investment if exercised, are measured at fair value each reporting period using a Monte Carlo simulation. The put and call options fair values, derived from the Monte Carlo simulation, were million and million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. The put and call options fair values, derived from the Monte Carlo simulation, were million and million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The put liability and call asset are included within other long-term liabilities and other long-term assets, respectively, within our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 The significant unobservable inputs utilized in these Level 3 fair value measurements (and selected values) include the enterprise value, annualized volatility and credit spread. Enterprise value was derived from a discounted cash flow model, which utilized significant unobservable inputs for long-term revenue, to measure underlying cash flows, weighted average cost of capital and long term growth rate.

 Credit spread - 
 - 
 Revenue exit multiple x - x 
 x - x 
 Weighted average cost of capital - 
 - 
 Long term growth rate 
 The assumptions used for annualized volatility, credit spread and weighted average cost of capital reflect the lowest and highest values where they differ significantly across the series of put and call options due to their expected exercise dates. 
 Other Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value 
 Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis subject to fair value adjustment only in certain circumstances. As disclosed in Note 3, we acquired various health and wellness related businesses during 2024 and 2023. The net assets acquired and resulting goodwill and other intangible assets were recorded at fair value primarily using Level 3 inputs. The net tangible assets including receivables and accrued liabilities were recorded at their carrying value which approximated their fair value due to their short term nature. The fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets were internally estimated based primarily on the income approach. The income approach estimates fair value based on the present value of cash flow that the assets could be expected to generate in the future. We developed internal estimates for expected cash flows in the present value calculation using inputs and significant assumptions that include historical revenues and earnings, revenue growth rates, the amount and timing

 The total estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported, or IBNR, is included within the net incurred claims amounts. At September 30, 2024, benefits payable included IBNR of approximately billion, primarily associated with claims incurred in 2024. 
 Amounts incurred related to prior periods vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims ultimately are settled. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated (favorable development). 
 Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims. Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. For additional information regarding our benefits payable and benefits expense recognition, refer to Note 2 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The year-over-year increase in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to a change in the mix of current year earnings between our Insurance segment and our CenterWell health services segment, as our CenterWell health services segment is subject to a higher effective tax rate than our Insurance segment. In addition, the prior year income tax rate was favorably impacted by the recognition of a non-taxable gain.

 Revolving Credit Agreements 
 In June 2023, we entered into an amended and restated , billion unsecured revolving credit agreement (replacing the , billion unsecured revolving credit agreement entered in June 2021). In May 2024, we entered into an amendment to increase commitments billion resulting in a billion borrowing capacity. 
 In May 2024, we entered into a billion unsecured revolving credit agreement (replacing the billion unsecured revolving credit agreement entered in June 2023, which expired in accordance with its terms). 
 Under the credit agreements, at our option, we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion bears interest at Term SOFR or the base rate plus a spread. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based Term SOFR, at our option. 
 The SOFR spread, currently basis points under the revolving credit agreement and basis points under the revolving credit agreement, varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from to basis points under the revolving credit agreement and from to basis points under the revolving credit agreement. We also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently basis points, under the revolving credit agreement and basis points under the revolving agreement, varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from to basis points under the revolving credit agreement and from to basis points under the revolving credit agreement. 
 Our credit agreements contain customary restrictive covenants and a financial covenant regarding maximum debt to capitalization of , as well as customary events of default. We are in compliance with this financial covenant, with actual debt to capitalization of as measured in accordance with the revolving credit agreements as of September 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had borrowings and approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit agreements. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, we had billion of remaining borrowing capacity under the -year revolving credit agreement and billion of remaining borrowing capacity under the -day revolving credit agreement (which excludes the uncommitted million of incremental loan facilities), none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement.

 of our total premiums and services revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisted of products covered under the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan contracts with the federal government. These contracts are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by May 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare products have been renewed for 2024, and all of our product offerings filed with CMS for 2024 have been approved. 
 CMS uses a risk-adjustment model which adjusts premiums paid to Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans according to health status of covered members. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, or BBA, and the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, or BIPA, generally pays more where a plan's membership has higher expected costs. Under this model, rates paid to MA plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard Medicare-covered benefits to an enrollee with a "national average risk profile." That baseline payment amount is adjusted to account for certain demographic characteristics and health status of our enrolled members. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all MA plans must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses the diagnosis data, collected from providers, to calculate the health status-related risk-adjusted premium payment to MA plans, which CMS further adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government fee-for-service, or FFS, program. We generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our employees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our health status-adjusted payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on these providers to document appropriately all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. In addition, we conduct medical record reviews as part of our data and payment accuracy compliance efforts, to more accurately reflect diagnosis conditions under the risk adjustment model. 
 CMS and the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, or HHS-OIG, perform audits of various companies risk adjustment diagnosis data submissions. We refer to these audits as Risk-Adjustment Data Validation Audits, or RADV audits. RADV audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices that influence the calculation of health status-related premium payments to MA plans. 
 In 2012, CMS released an MA contract-level RADV methodology that would extrapolate the results of each CMS RADV audit sample to the audited MA contract s entire health status-related risk adjusted premium amount for the year under audit. In doing so, CMS recognized that the documentation standard used in RADV audits to determine a contract s payment error (medical records) is different from the documentation standard used to develop the Part C risk-adjustment model (FFS claims). To correct for this difference, CMS stated that it would apply a Fee-for-Service Adjuster (FFS Adjuster) as an offset to the preliminary recovery amount. This adjuster would

 of our total premiums and services revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of serving members enrolled in Medicaid, and in certain circumstances members who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare, under contracts with various states. 
 At September 30, 2024, our Military services business, which accounted for approximately of our total premiums and services revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisted of the TRICARE T2017 East Region contract. The T2017 East Region contract comprises states and approximately million TRICARE beneficiaries, under which delivery of health care services commenced on January 1, 2018. The T2017 East Region contract, which was originally set to expire on December 31, 2022, was subsequently extended by the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, and is currently scheduled to expire on December 31, 2024, unless further extended.

The length of the contract is one transition year followed by annual option periods, which, if all options are exercised, would result in a total contract length of . 
 The loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative or regulatory action, including reductions in premium payments to us, regulatory restrictions on profitability, including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our Medicare Advantage profitability to our non-Medicare Advantage business profitability, or compare the profitability of various products within our Medicare Advantage business, and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other, or increases in member benefits or member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

 In June 2024, a putative stockholder class action was filed against Humana Inc. and certain of our current and former executive officers under the federal securities laws in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The case, now captioned In re Humana Stockholders Litigation. , alleges that between July 2022 and January 2024, Humana made false or misleading statements in its periodic SEC filings and statements to the financial markets about our financial performance and the medical costs in our Medicare Advantage business. In July 2024 and October 2024, parallel stockholder derivative action captioned Silva v. Broussard and Spikes v. Broussard, respectively, were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky alleging that the same claimed acts and omissions underlying the federal securities law case also constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by certain of our current and former directors and executive officers.

 reportable segments, Insurance and CenterWell, are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Decision Maker, to assess performance and allocate resources. 
 The Insurance segment consists of Medicare benefits, marketed to individuals or directly via group Medicare accounts, as well as our contract with CMS to administer the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition, or LI-NET, prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide Medicaid, dual eligible demonstration, and Long-Term Support Services benefits, which we refer to collectively as our state-based contracts. This segment also includes products consisting of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health benefits, as well as administrative services only, or ASO. In addition, our Insurance segment includes our Military services business, primarily our T-2017 East Region contract, as well as the operations of our PBM business. 
 The CenterWell segment includes our pharmacy, primary care, and home solutions operations. The segment also includes our strategic partnerships with WCAS to develop and operate senior-focused, payor-agnostic, primary care centers, as well as our minority ownership interest in hospice operations. Services offered by this segment are designed to enhance the overall healthcare experience. These services may lead to lower utilization associated with improved member health and/or lower drug costs. 
 Our CenterWell intersegment revenues primarily relate to the operations of CenterWell Pharmacy (our mail- order pharmacy business), CenterWell Specialty Pharmacy, and retail pharmacies jointly located within CenterWell Senior Primary Care clinics. 
 In addition, our CenterWell intersegment revenues include revenues earned by certain owned providers derived from certain value-based arrangements with our health plans. Under these value-based arrangements, our owned providers enter into agreements with our health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control the administration and management of certain health care services for our members. In exchange, the owned provider receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-member per-month basis. These value-based arrangements represent a single performance obligation where revenues are recognized in the period in which we are obligated to provide integrated health care services to our members. Fee-for-service revenue is recognized at agreed upon rates, net of contractual allowances, as the performance obligation is completed on the date of service. 
 We present our condensed consolidated results of operations from the perspective of the health plans. As a result, the cost of providing benefits to our members, whether provided via a third party provider or internally through a stand-alone subsidiary, is classified as benefits expense and excludes the portion of the cost for which the health plans do not bear responsibility, including member co-share amounts and government subsidies of billion and billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, these amounts were billion and billion respectively. In

 million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Other than those described previously, the accounting policies of each segment are the same. For additional information regarding our accounting policies refer to Note 2 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our 2023 Form 10-K. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of products and services rendered by our CenterWell segment, primarily pharmacy, primary care, and home solutions, to our Insurance segment customers. Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded primarily at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. Members served by our segments often use the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments. Assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items are managed at a corporate level. These corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations in the tables presenting segment results below.

 Executive Overview 
 General 
 Humana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is committed to putting health first for our teammates, our customers, and our company. Through our Humana insurance services, and our CenterWell health care services, we make it easier for the millions of people we serve to achieve their best health delivering the care and service they need, when they need it. These efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with Medicare, Medicaid, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large. 
 Our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. The benefit ratio, which is computed by taking 
 total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. The operating cost ratio, which is computed by taking total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenue less investment income, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency. 
 Employer Group Commercial Medical Products Business Exit 
 In February 2023, we announced our planned exit from the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business, which includes all fully insured, self-funded and Federal Employee Health Benefit medical plans, as well as associated wellness and rewards programs. No other Humana health plan offerings are materially affected. Following a strategic review, we determined the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business was no longer positioned to sustainably meet the needs of commercial members over the long term or support our long-term strategic plans. We anticipate the exit of this line of business to be finalized in the first half of 2025. 
 Value Creation Initiative s 
 Beginning in 2022, in order to create capacity to fund growth and investment in our Medicare Advantage business and further expansion of our healthcare services capabilities, we committed to drive additional value for the enterprise through cost saving, productivity initiatives, and value acceleration from previous investments. As a result of these initiatives, we recorded charges, primarily in asset impairments, of 55 million and 151 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 52 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 within operating costs in the condensed consolidated statements of income. These charges were recorded at the corporate level and not allocated to the segments. We expect to incur additional charges through the end of 2024.

 Business Segments 
 Our two reportable segments, Insurance and CenterWell, are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Decision Maker, to assess performance and allocate resources. 
 The Insurance segment consists of Medicare benefits, marketed to individuals or directly via group Medicare accounts, as well as our contract with CMS to administer the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition, or LI-NET, prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide Medicaid, dual eligible demonstration, and Long-Term Support Services benefits, which we refer to collectively as our state-based contracts. This segment also includes products consisting of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health benefits, as well as administrative services only, or ASO. In addition, our Insurance segment includes our Military services business, primarily our T-2017 East Region contract, as well as the operations of our PBM business. 
 The CenterWell segment includes our pharmacy, primary care, and home solutions operations. The segment also includes our strategic partnerships with WCAS to develop and operate senior-focused, payor-agnostic, primary care centers, as well as our minority ownership interest in hospice operations. Services offered by this segment are designed to enhance the overall healthcare experience. These services may lead to lower utilization associated with improved member health and/or lower drug costs. 
 The results of each segment are measured by income (loss) from operations. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of products and services rendered by our CenterWell segment, primarily pharmacy, primary care, and home solutions, to our Insurance segment customers. Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded primarily at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. Members served by our segments often use the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments. Assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items are managed at a corporate level. These corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations. 
 Seasonality 
 One of the product offerings of our Insurance segment is Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDP, under the Medicare Part D program. Our quarterly Insurance segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member s cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member s plan period, which begins annually on January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. As a result, the PDP benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our stand-alone PDP products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern. 
 The Insurance segment also experiences seasonality in the commercial fully-insured product offering. The effect on the Insurance segment benefit ratio is opposite of the Medicare stand-alone PDP impact, with the benefit ratio increasing as fully-insured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. The Employer Group Commercial Fully-Insured business increased the Insurance segment benefit ratio by 10 basis points and increased the Insurance segment benefit ratio by 20 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Employer Group Commercial Fully-Insured business did not impact the Insurance segment benefit ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Table of Contents 

 The Insurance segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the Medicare marketing season. The Insurance segment may experience adverse impacts in the operating cost ratio as a result of our Employer Group Commercial Medical Products exit. The Employer Group Commercial Fully-Insured business increased the Insurance segment operating cost ratio by 10 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased the Insurance segment operating cost ratio by 40 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Employer Group Commercial Fully-Insured business did not impact the Insurance segment operating cost ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and increased the Insurance segment operating cost ratio by 40 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 2024 Highlights 
 Our strategy offers our members affordable health care combined with a positive consumer experience in growing markets. At the core of this strategy is our integrated care delivery model, which unites quality care, high member engagement, and sophisticated data analytics. Our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused, provided by both employed physicians and physicians with network contract arrangements. The model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience. We believe this strategy is positioning us for long-term growth in both membership and earnings. We offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service to a value-based arrangement. These include performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships. At September 30, 2024, approximately 3,984,900 members, or 70 , of our individual Medicare Advantage members were in value-based relationships under our integrated care delivery model, as compared to 3,727,500 members, or 69 , at September 30, 2023. 
 Net income attributable to Humana was 0.5 billion, or 3.98 per diluted common share, and 0.8 billion, or 6.71 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net income attributable to Humana was 1.9 billion, or 15.72 per diluted common share, and 3.0 billion, or 24.26 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. These comparisons were significantly impacted by put/call valuation adjustments associated with non-consolidating minority interest investments, charges associated with value creation initiatives, transaction and integration costs and an accrual related to certain anticipated litigation expenses. The impact of these adjustments to our consolidated income before income taxes and equity in net earnings and diluted earnings per common share was as follows for the 2024 and 2023 quarter and period:

 We are and will continue to be regularly subject to new laws and regulations, changes to existing laws and regulations, and judicial determinations that impact the interpretation and applicability of those laws and regulations. The Health Care Reform Law, the Families First Act, the CARES Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, and related regulations, are examples of laws which have enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry, including, among others, mandated coverage requirements, mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with insurance products, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to Medicare Advantage premiums, the establishment of federally facilitated or state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values, and changes to the Part D prescription drug benefit design . 
 It is reasonably possible that these laws and regulations, as well as other current or future legislative, judicial or regulatory changes including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network, manage and sell our products, or otherwise operate our business, or restrictions on profitability, including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our Medicare Advantage profitability to our non-Medicare Advantage business profitability, or compare the profitability of various products within our Medicare Advantage business, and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other, increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses, or changes to the Part D prescription drug benefit design (and uncertainty arising from the implementation of these changes) in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, further lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments); our financial position (including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill); and our cash flows. 
 In March 2024, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission issued its final regulation on climate-related disclosures. The regulation requires certain disclosures in registration statements and annual reports, including financial impact and climate-related impact metrics. On April 4, 2024, the SEC exercised its discretion to stay the Final Rules pending the completion of judicial review. The new regulation is effective for us beginning with the annual report for the year ended December 31, 2025. We are evaluating the final rule and its impact on our disclosures. 
 
 We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of products and services rendered by our CenterWell segment, primarily pharmacy, primary care, and home solutions, to our Insurance segment customers and are described in Note 14 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.

 Comparison of Results of Operations for 2024 and 2023 
 The following discussion primarily deals with our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, or the 2024 quarter, the three months ended September 30, 2023, or the 2023 quarter, the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or the 2024 period, and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, or the 2023 period.

 Premiums Revenue 
 
 Consolidated premiums revenue increased 2.9 billion, or 11.4 , from 25.1 billion in the 2023 quarter to 28.0 billion in the 2024 quarter and increased 8.2 billion, or 10.8 , from 76.1 billion in the 2023 period to 84.4

Table of Contents 

 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to higher per member Medicare premiums as well as Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts membership growth. These factors were partially offset by the continued decline in our group commercial medical and stand-alone PDP membership. 
 
 Services Revenue 
 Consolidated services revenue increased 87 million, or 8.6 , from 1.0 billion in the 2023 quarter to 1.1 billion in the 2024 quarter and increased 272 million, or 9.1 , from 3.0 billion in the 2023 period to 3.3 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to higher revenues associated with growth in the primary care business, partially offset by the impact of the v28 risk model revision. 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income increased 35 million, or 11.4 , from 308 million in the 2023 quarter to 343 million in the 2024 quarter and increased 154 million, or 19.9 , from 775 million in the 2023 period to 929 million in the 2024 period primarily due to increase in interest income on our debt securities. 
 Benefit Expense 
 Consolidated benefits expense increased 3.4 billion, or 15.5 , from 21.7 billion in the 2023 quarter to 25.1 billion in the 2024 quarter and increased 9.7 billion, or 14.7 , from 65.6 billion in the 2023 period to 75.3 billion in the 2024 period. The consolidated benefit ratio increased 330 basis points from 86.6 for the 2023 quarter to 89.9 for the 2024 quarter and increased 300 basis points from 86.2 for the 2023 period to 89.2 for the 2024 period primarily due to the continued impact of elevated Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts medical cost trends in the 2024 quarter and period. The elevated medical cost trend was partially offset by the impact of the pricing and benefit design of our 2024 Medicare Advantage products, which included a reduction in member benefits in response to the net impact of the 2024 final rate notice and the initial emergence of increased medical cost trends in 2023. Further, the year-over-year comparisons continue to reflect a shift in line of business mix, with growth in Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts and other membership, which can carry a higher benefit ratio. 
 Consolidated benefits expense included 24 million of favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in the 2024 quarter and 4 million of favorable prior-period medical claims development in the 2023 quarter. Consolidated benefits expense included 693 million of favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in the 2024 period and 758 million of favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in the 2023 period. Prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 10 basis points in the 2024 quarter and did not impact the consolidated benefit ratio in the 2023 quarter. Prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 80 basis points in the 2024 period and decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 100 basis points in the 2023 period. 
 Operating Costs 
 Our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. We allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. 
 Consolidated operating costs increased 68 million, or 2.1 , from 3.3 billion in the 2023 quarter to 3.3 billion in the 2024 quarter and increased 168 million, or 1.8 , from 9.4 billion in the 2023 period to 9.5 billion in the 2024 period. The consolidated operating cost ratio decreased 100 basis points from 12.5 for the 2023 quarter to 11.5 for the 2024 quarter and decreased 90 basis points from 11.8 for the 2023 period to 10.9 for the 2024 period primarily due to scale efficiencies associated with growth in our Medicare Advantage membership, administrative cost efficiencies resulting from our value creation initiatives, lower impact of commission expense for brokers in 2024 compared to 2023 as a result of significant individual Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2023, and the impact of the accrued charge related to certain anticipated litigation expenses included in the 2023

 quarter and period results. These factors were partially offset by the impact from charges related to value creation initiatives in the 2024 quarter and period. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 9 million, or 4.5 , from 201 million in the 2023 quarter to 210 million in the 2024 quarter and increased 53 million, or 9.2 , from 578 million in the 2023 period to 631 million in the 2024 period primarily due to capital expenditures. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased 55 million, or 48.2 , from 114 million in the 2023 quarter to 169 million in the 2024 quarter and increased 149 million, or 42.9 , from 347 million in the 2023 period to 496 million in the 2024 period primarily due to increase in interest rates and higher average debt balances. 
 Income Taxes 
 The effective income tax rate was 24.4 and 23.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and 24.9 and 23.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The year-over-year increase in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to a change in the mix of current year earnings between our Insurance segment and our CenterWell health services segment, as our CenterWell health services segment is subject to a higher effective tax rate than our Insurance segment. In addition, the prior year income tax rate was favorably impacted by the recognition of a non-taxable gain.

 Income from operations 
 Insurance segment income from operations decreased 0.4 billion, or 62.0 , from 0.7 billion in the 2023 quarter to 0.3 billion in the 2024 quarter and decreased 1.1 billion, or 37.2 , from 3.1 billion in the 2023 period to 1.9 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to the same factors impacting the segment's higher benefit ratio partially offset by the lower operating cost ratio as more fully described below. 
 Enrollment 
 Individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 284,800 members, or 5.3 , from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily due to membership additions associated with the previous Annual Election Period, or AEP. Individual Medicare Advantage membership includes 939,600 D-SNP members as of September 30, 2024, a net increase of 71,600 D-SNP members, or 8.2 , from 868,000 D-SNP members as of September 30, 2023. 
 Group Medicare Advantage membership increased 36,400 members, or 7.1 , from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily due to growth in small and medium group accounts. 
 Medicare stand-alone PDP membership decreased 570,100 members, or 19.8 , from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily due to continued intensified competition for Medicare stand-alone PDP offerings. 
 State-based contracts and other membership increased 181,500 members, or 14.4 , from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily reflecting the impact of membership additions associated with the implementation of new contracts partially offset with membership loss as a result of the public health of emergency unwind. 
 
 Commercial fully-insured medical membership decreased 383,400 members, or 93.7 , from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 and commercial ASO medical membership decreased 261,900 members, or 92.1 , from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. These decreases reflect our planned exit of the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business, which includes all fully insured, self-funded and Federal Employee Health Benefit medical plans, as well as associated wellness and rewards programs. We anticipate the exit of this line of business to be finalized in the first half of 2025. 
 Specialty membership decreased 397,500 members, or 8.0 , from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily due to non-renewal of dental and vision plans as a result of exit from the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business partially offset by growth in dental and vision plans as a result of Medicare Advantage enrollment. 
 
 Premiums Revenue 
 Insurance segment premiums revenue increased 2.9 billion, or 11.4 , from 25.1 billion in the 2023 quarter to 28.0 billion in the 2024 quarter and increased 8.2 billion, or 10.8 , from 76.1 billion in the 2023 period to 84.4 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to higher per member Medicare premiums as well as Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts membership growth. These factors were partially offset by the continued decline in our group commercial medical and stand-alone PDP membership. 
 Services Revenue 
 Insurance segment services revenue decreased 31 million, or 12.1 , from 257 million in the 2023 quarter to 226 million in the 2024 quarter and decreased 15 million, or 2.1 , from 730 million in the 2023 period to 715 million in the 2024 period.

 Benefits Expense 
 The Insurance segment benefit ratio increased 300 basis points from 87.6 for the 2023 quarter to 90.6 for the 2024 quarter and increased 300 basis points from 86.8 for the 2023 period to 89.8 for the 2024 period primarily due to the continued impact of elevated Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts medical cost trends in the 2024 quarter and period. The elevated medical cost trend was partially offset by the impact of the pricing and benefit design of our 2024 Medicare Advantage products, which included a reduction in member benefits in response to the net impact of the 2024 final rate notice and the initial emergence of increased medical cost trends in 2023. Further, the year-over-year comparisons continue to reflect a shift in line of business mix, with growth in Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts and other membership, which can carry a higher benefit ratio. 
 Operating Costs 
 The Insurance segment operating cost ratio decreased 120 basis points from 10.4 for the 2023 quarter to 9.2 for the 2024 quarter and decreased 130 basis points from 9.9 for the 2023 period to 8.6 for the 2024 period primarily due to scale efficiencies associated with growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership, administrative cost efficiencies resulting from our value creation initiatives, lower impact of commission expense for brokers in 2024 compared to 2023 as a result of significant individual Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2023, and the impact of the accrued charge related to certain anticipated litigation expenses included in the 2023 quarter and period results.

 Income from operations 
 CenterWell income from operations decreased 18 million, or 4.5 , from 400 million in the 2023 quarter to 382 million in the 2024 quarter and decreased 0.02 billion, or 1.5 , from 1.02 billion in the 2023 period to 1.00 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to the same factors impacting the segment's operating cost ratio as more fully described below. 
 Services Revenue 
 CenterWell services revenue increased 118 million, or 15.5 , from 759 million in the 2023 quarter to 877 million in the 2024 quarter and increased 0.3 billion, or 12.7 , from 2.3 billion in the 2023 period to 2.6 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to higher revenues associated with growth in the primary care business, partially offset by the impact of the v28 risk model revision. 
 Intersegment Revenue 
 CenterWell intersegment revenues increased 0.3 billion, or 6.7 , from 3.9 billion in the 2023 quarter to 4.2 billion in the 2024 quarter and increased 0.8 billion, or 7.2 , from 11.4 billion in the 2023 period to 12.3 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to greater intersegment revenues associated with the home solutions business in the 2024 quarter and period as compared to the 2023 quarter and period as a result of the expansion of the value-based home care model, higher revenues associated with growth in the primary care business, partially offset by the impact of the v28 risk model revision, as well as an increase in pharmacy solutions revenues resulting from growth in the specialty pharmacy business, driven by increased penetration of Humana health plan members and payor agnostic consumers.

 Operating Costs 
 The CenterWell segment operating cost ratio increased 100 basis points from 90.3 for the 2023 quarter to 91.3 for the 2024 quarter and increased 60 basis points from 91.5 for the 2023 period to 92.1 for the 2024 period primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the v28 risk model revision to the primary care business partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies resulting from our value creation initiatives and positive prior-period medical claims reserve development within the Primary Care Organization. 
 
 Liquidity 
 Historically, our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums, services revenue, and investment and other income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, and borrowings. Our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments, operating costs, interest on borrowings, taxes, purchases of investment securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repayments on borrowings, dividends, and share repurchases. As premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment. From period to period, our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable, benefits payable, and other receivables and payables. Our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D subsidies for which we do not assume risk. The use of cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators) which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent. Our use of cash flows derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as in our CenterWell segment, is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators). 
 For additional information regarding our liquidity risk, refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-Q. 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased to approximately 5.1 billion at September 30, 2024 from 4.7 billion at December 31, 2023. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is summarized as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended 2024 2023 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 3,494 11,115 Net cash used in investing activities (2,889) (2,610) Net cash provided by financing activities (183) 1,582 Increase in cash and cash equivalents 422 10,087 
 Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 Cash flows provided by operations of 3.5 billion in the 2024 period decreased 7.6 billion from cash flows provided by operations of 11.1 billion in the 2023 period. Our operating cash flows for the 2023 period were significantly impacted by the early receipt of the Medicare premium remittance of 7.1 billion in September 2023 because the payment date for October 2023 fell on a weekend. Generally, when the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday, with the exception of January 1 (New Year's Day), we receive this payment at the end of the previous month. This also resulted in an increase to unearned revenues in our condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2023. The 2024 period does not include an early receipt of the Medicare premium remittance. Our operating cash flows for the 2024 period also reflect lower earnings compared to the 2023 period, partially offset by the favorable impact of working capital items in the 2024 period. 
 The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums. Benefits expense includes claim payments, capitation payments, pharmacy costs

 The detail of total net receivables at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and reconciliation to cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 2024 Period Change 2023 Period Change (in millions) Medicare 1,289 1,426 (137) 33 Commercial and other 753 549 204 96 Military services 195 148 47 24 Allowances (93) (88) (5) (3) Total net receivables 2,144 2,035 109 150 Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Receivables acquired (24) Change in receivables per cash flow statement 109 126 
 
 The changes in Medicare receivables for both the 2024 period and the 2023 period reflect individual Medicare Advantage membership growth and the typical pattern caused by the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the CMS risk-adjustment model. Significant collections occur with the mid-year and final settlements with CMS in the second and third quarter. 
 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 During the 2024 period and 2023 period, we acquired various businesses for approximately 37 million and 223 million, net of cash and cash equivalents received, respectively. 
 Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives, support of services in our primary care operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members, claims processing, billing and collections, wellness solutions, care coordination, regulatory compliance and customer service. Total net capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were 421 million in the 2024 period and 721 million in the 2023 period. 
 Net purchases of investment securities were 2.4 billion and 1.7 billion in the 2024 period and 2023 period, respectively. 
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 Claim payments were higher than receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk by 0.6 billion in the 2024 period and receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were higher than claim payments by 2.5 billion in the 2023 period. 
 Under our administrative services only TRICARE contracts, health care costs payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government by 75 million and 28 million in the 2024 and 2023 periods, respectively. 
 In March 2024, we issued 1.25 billion of 5.375 unsecured senior notes due April 15, 2031 and 1.00 billion of 5.750 unsecured senior notes due April 15, 2054. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discounts and

 commissions paid, were 2.23 billion. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include the repayment of existing indebtedness, including borrowings under our commercial paper program. 
 In August 2023, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Repurchase Plan to repurchase a portion of our 750 million aggregate principal amount of 1.350 senior notes maturing in February 2027, our 600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.950 senior notes maturing in March 2027, our 750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.700 senior notes maturing in March 2029, and our 500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125 senior notes maturing in August 2029 during the period beginning on August 7, 2023 and ending on November 15, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 213 million principal amount of these senior notes for approximately 196 million cash. 
 In March 2023, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Repurchase Plan to repurchase a portion of our 1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.650 senior notes maturing in August 2023 and our 600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.850 senior notes maturing in October 2024 during the period beginning on March 13, 2023 and ending on July 21, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 361 million principal amount of these senior notes for approximately 358 million cash. In August 2023, we repaid the remaining 1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of our 0.650 senior notes due on their maturity date of August 3, 2023. 
 In March 2023, we issued 500 million of 5.700 unsecured senior notes due March 13, 2026 and 750 million of 5.500 unsecured senior notes due March 15, 2053. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discounts and commissions paid, were 1.2 billion. We used the net proceeds to repay outstanding amounts under our 500 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which include the repayment of existing indebtedness, including borrowings under our commercial paper program 
 Net repayments from the issuance of commercial paper were 895 million in the 2024 period and net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were 1.6 billion in the 2023 period. The maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during the 2024 period was 2.7 billion. 
 We repurchased common shares for 750 million and 980 million in the 2024 period and 2023 period, respectively, under share repurchase plans authorized by the Board of Directors. We also acquired common shares in connection with employee stock plans for 18 million and 31 million in the 2024 period and 2023 period, respectively. 
 We paid dividends to stockholders of 323 million and 320 million during the 2024 period and 2023 period, respectively. 

Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 Dividends 
 For additional information regarding our dividends to stockholders, refer to Note 10 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q. 
 Stock Repurchases 
 For additional information regarding stock repurchases, refer to Note 10 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q. 
 Debt 
 For additional information regarding debt, including our senior notes, term loans, revolving credit agreements, commercial paper program and other short-term borrowings, refer to Note 12 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents 

 Acquisitions 
 For additional information regarding acquisitions, refer to Note 3 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q. 
 Liquidity Requirements 
 We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement and our commercial paper program or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, acquisitions, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, as well as to refinance or repay debt, and repurchase shares. 
 Adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at September 30, 2024 was BBB according to Standard Poor s Rating Services, or S P, and Baa2 according to Moody s Investors Services, Inc., or Moody s. A downgrade by S P to BB+ or by Moody s to Ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to 250 million of our senior notes. Successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points, or annual interest expense by 1 million, up to a maximum 100 basis points, or annual interest expense by 3 million. 
 In addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. Humana Inc., our parent company, is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the parent company were 609 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 510 million at December 31, 2023. This increase primarily reflects working capital changes, net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and commercial paper, proceeds from the sale and maturities of investment securities, dividends from insurance subsidiaries and cash from certain non-insurance subsidiaries within our CenterWell segment partially offset by common stock repurchases, repayment of maturing senior notes, repayment of borrowings under the commercial paper program, purchases of investment securities, capital expenditures, capital contributions to certain subsidiaries, cash dividends to shareholders and acquisitions. Our use of operating cash derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as our CenterWell segment, is generally not restricted by departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators). 
 Regulatory Requirements 
 Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, or ordinary dividends, is limited based on the entity s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend requiring prior regulatory approval. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. 
 Although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements vary significantly at the state level. Based on the most recently filed statutory financial statements as of June 30, 2024, our state regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately 13.5 billion, which exceeded aggregate minimum regulatory requirements of 10.6 billion. The amount of ordinary dividends paid to our parent company was approximately 0.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The amount, timing and mix of ordinary and extraordinary dividend payments will vary due to state regulatory requirements, the level of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk, including those resulting from changes in interest rates. 
 Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio, consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investment-grade quality with a weighted average S P credit rating of AA- at September 30, 2024. Our net unrealized position decreased 448 million from a net unrealized loss position of 1,294 million at December 31, 2023 to a net unrealized loss position of 846 million at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had gross unrealized losses of 998 million on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates since the time the securities were purchased. There w ere no material credit allowances d uring the nine months ended September 30, 2024. While we believe that these securities in an unrealized loss will recover in value over time and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities, given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or credit allowances may be recorded in future periods. 
 Duration is the time-weighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio s cash flow. Duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates, providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates. However, actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration. The average duration of our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was approximately 3.3 years as of September 30, 2024 and 3.0 years as of December 31, 2023. Based on the duration, including cash equivalents, a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 803 million at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, our Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, and our Principal Accounting Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Based on our evaluation, our CEO, CFO, and our Principal Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information the Company is required to disclose in its reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, including, without limitation, ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 For additional information regarding legal proceedings pending against us and certain other pending or threatened litigation, investigations or other matters, refer to Legal Proceedings and Certain Regulatory Matters in Note 13 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the risk factor set forth below. 
 The number of our Medicare Advantage plans rated 4-star or higher are expected to significantly decline in 2025. We have filed a lawsuit seeking to set aside and vacate the 2025 Star Ratings of our Medicare Advantage plans, but there is no assurance that we will prevail in this lawsuit. If we are not successful the decline in our Star Ratings may negatively impact our 2026 quality bonus payments from CMS and may also significantly adversely affect our revenues, operating results, and cash flows. 
 Based on 2025 Medicare Advantage Star Ratings released by CMS in October 2024, approximately 25 of our Medicare Advantage members are currently enrolled in plans rated 4-star or higher for 2025, as compared to 94 based on our 2024 Star Ratings. We have filed a lawsuit that, among other things, seeks to set aside and vacate the 2025 Star Ratings for our Medicare Advantage plans, but there is no assurance that we will prevail in the lawsuit. If we are not successful the decline in our Star Ratings performance for 2025 may negatively impact our 2026 quality bonus payments from CMS and may also significantly adversely affect our revenues, operating results, and cash flows. Please see Legal Proceedings and Certain Regulatory Matters in Note 13 to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q for a description of the lawsuit.
