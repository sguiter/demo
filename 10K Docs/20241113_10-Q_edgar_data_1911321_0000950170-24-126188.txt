SEC Exemptive Relief As a BDC, the Company is subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making its investments. For example, BDCs generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price and quantity are the only negotiated terms. On March 6, 2023, the SEC issued an order (the Co-Investment Order granting the Company s application for exemptive relief to co-invest, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, in certain private placement transactions, with other funds managed by the Advisor or its affiliates. Under the terms of the Co-Investment Order, in order for the Company to participate in a co-investment transaction, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Company s Independent Trustees must conclude that (i) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching with respect of the Company or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned, and (ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s shareholders and is consistent with the Company s investment objectives and strategies and certain criteria established by the Board. On June 18, 2024, the SEC issued an order (the Multi-Class Order granting the Company s application for exemptive relief from sections 18(a)(2), 18(c), 18(i) and 61(a) under the 1940 Act. Under the terms of the Multi-Class Order, the Company is permitted to offer multiple classes of its Common Shares with varying sales loads and asset-based distribution and/or service fees. Managing Dealer Agreement On April 11, 2024, the Company entered into a managing dealer agreement with the Managing Dealer (the Managing Dealer Agreement ), pursuant to which the Managing Dealer agreed to, among other things, manage the Company s relationships with third-party brokers engaged by the Managing Dealer to participate in the distribution of Common Shares, which the Company refers to as participating brokers, and financial advisors. The Managing Dealer also coordinates the Company s marketing and distribution efforts with participating brokers and their registered representatives with respect to communications related to the terms of the offering, the Company s investment strategies, material aspects of the Company s operations and subscription procedures. As set forth in and pursuant to the Managing Dealer Agreement, the Company pays the Managing Dealer certain fees, including a retainer paid monthly in arrears, to be deducted by any applicable commissions (five basis points paid at point of sale on all Common Shares sold to the public by the Managing Dealer) paid in the relevant month. The retainer terminates upon payment of in total fees to the Managing Dealer. The Company does not pay referral or similar fees to any accountants, attorneys or other persons in connection with the distribution of its shares, but may pay for certain due diligence expenses, expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of prospectuses to other than current shareholders and the printing and mailing of sales literature and expenses incurred relating to offering the Common Shares as an option on any distribution platform, including expenses for any services provided in connection therewith. Either party may terminate the Managing Dealer Agreement at any time with or without cause effective upon receipt of written notice to that effect. The Company s obligations under the Managing Dealer Agreement to pay the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to the Class S and Class D shares distributed in the Public Offering as described therein shall survive termination of the agreement until such shares are no longer outstanding (including such shares that have been converted into Class I shares).

Class D shares 

Class I shares 

The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are paid monthly in arrears, calculated using the net asset value of the applicable class as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month and subject to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. FINRA and other limitations on underwriting compensation. The Managing Dealer will reallow (pay) all or a portion of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to participating brokers and servicing brokers for ongoing shareholder services performed by such brokers, and will waive shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to the extent a broker is not eligible to receive it for failure to provide such services. Because the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to Class S shares and Class D shares are calculated based on the aggregate net asset value for all of the outstanding shares of each such class, it reduces the net asset value with respect to all shares of each such class, including shares issued under the Company s dividend reinvestment plan. Eligibility to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee is conditioned on a broker providing the following ongoing services with respect to the Class S or Class D shares: assistance with recordkeeping, answering investor inquiries regarding us, including regarding distribution payments and reinvestments, helping investors understand their investments upon their request, and assistance with share repurchase requests. If the applicable broker is not eligible to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee due to failure to provide these services, the Managing Dealer will waive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee that broker would have otherwise been eligible to receive. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are ongoing fees that are not paid at the time of purchase and are similar to commissions. 	For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company accrued no distribution and shareholder servicing fees attributable to Class S shares and Class D shares. Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement The Company has entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (as amended, the Expense Support Agreement with the Advisor, pursuant to which the Advisor has contractually agreed to pay Other Operating Expenses (as defined below) of the Company on the Company s behalf (each such payment, a Required Expense Payment such that Other Operating Expenses of the Company do not exceed (on an annualized basis) of the Company s applicable quarter-end net asset value. Other Operating Expenses include the Company s organizational and offering expenses (including the Company s allocable portion of compensation and overhead (including rent, office equipment and utilities) and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, excluding Base Management Fees and Incentive Fees owed to the Advisor and any interest expenses owed by the Company. At such times as the Advisor determines, the Advisor may elect to pay certain additional expenses of the Company on the Company s behalf (each such payment, a Voluntary Expense Payment and together with a Required Expense Payment, the Expense Payments ). In making a Voluntary Expense Payment, the Advisor will designate,

prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by the Company under the Expense Support Agreement are referred to as a Reimbursement Payment. Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) the Company s net investment company taxable income (including net short-term capital gains reduced by net long-term capital losses), (ii) the Company s net capital gains (including the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). The amount of the Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter will equal the lesser of (i) the Excess Operating Funds in such quarter and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Expense Payments made by the Advisor to the Company within prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by the Company to the Advisor; provided that the Advisor may waive its right to receive all or a portion of any Reimbursement Payment in any particular calendar quarter, in which case such waived amount will remain unreimbursed Expense Payments reimbursable in future quarters pursuant to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement. No Reimbursement Payment for any quarter shall be made if: (1) the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share (as defined below) declared by the Company at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates, (2) the Company s Operating Expense Ratio at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is greater than the Operating Expense Ratio at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relate, or (3) the Company s Other Operating Expenses at the time of such Reimbursement Payment exceeds of the Company s applicable quarter-end net asset value. The Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share means the annualized rate, based on a 365-day year, of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Company s Operating Expense Ratio is calculated by dividing Operating Expenses (i.e. the Company s operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), less organizational and offering expenses, Base Management Fees and Incentive Fees owed to the Advisor, shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, and interest expense, by the Company s net assets. The Company s obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment will automatically become a liability of the Company on the last business day of the applicable calendar quarter, except to the extent the Advisor has waived its right to receive such payment for the applicable quarter. The Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter will be paid by the Company to the Advisor in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds as promptly as possible following such calendar quarter and in no event later than after the end of such calendar quarter. All Reimbursement Payments shall be deemed to relate to the earliest unreimbursed Expense Payments made by the Advisor to the Company within prior to the last business day of the calendar quarter in which such Reimbursement Payments obligation is accrued. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Advisor provided and of expense support, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Advisor provided and of expense support, respectively. The Company did t have any obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment as of September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023 under the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. The cumulative amount incurred from formation that is subject to future potential reimbursement is .

 Repurchases The Company has commenced a discretionary share repurchase program in which it may, subject to market conditions and the discretion of the Board, offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to of the Common Shares outstanding as of the close of the previous calendar quarter; provided, however, that the Company shall, subject to the Board s discretion and approval, repurchase Common Shares from shareholders in an amount at least equal to of the Company s net asset value in respect of the fourth calendar quarter of each of the eighth and tenth calendar years following the Initial Closing Date. The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time if in its reasonable judgment if it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest of the Company s shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect its operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Exchange Act Rule 13e-4 and the 1940 Act and subject to compliance with applicable covenants and any restrictions under the Company s financing arrangements. All shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be redeemed and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares.

shares were tendered for repurchase. Distributions Distributions will be paid at the discretion of the Board and will depend on the Company s earnings, financial condition, maintenance of the Company s tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time. Although the gross distribution per share is generally equivalent for each share class, the net distribution for each share class is reduced for any class specific expenses, including distribution and shareholder servicing fees, if any. Distributions from net investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal income tax regulations, which may differ from those amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. Distributions will be made to shareholders at such times and in such amounts as determined by the Board. The Company may pay distributions to its Shareholders in a year in excess of its net ordinary income and capital gains for that year and, accordingly, a portion of such distributions may constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company intends to timely distribute to its Shareholders substantially all of its annual taxable income for each year, except that the Company may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment and, depending upon the level of the Company s taxable income earned in a year, the Company may choose to carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following year and pay any applicable tax. The specific tax characteristics of the Company s distributions will be reported to Shareholders after the end of the calendar year. All distributions will be subject to available funds, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to declare such distributions in future periods. In addition, the Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan DRP ), pursuant to which each shareholder will receive dividends in the form of additional Common Shares unless they notify the Company that they instead desire to receive cash or a combination of cash and Common Shares as set forth below. If a shareholder receives dividends in the form of Common Shares, dividend proceeds that otherwise would have been distributed in cash will be retained by the Company for reinvestment. Shareholders who receive dividends and other distributions in the form of Common Shares generally are subject to the same U.S. federal tax consequences as investors who elect to receive their distributions in cash; however, since their cash dividends will be reinvested, those investors will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes on re-invested dividends. A shareholder may elect to receive dividends and other distributions in cash or a combination of cash and Common Shares by notifying the Company in the manner set forth in the shareholder s Subscription Agreement at least business days prior to the dividend or distribution declaration date fixed by the Board for such dividend. If such notice is received by the Company less than business days prior to the relevant dividend or distribution declaration date, then that dividend will be paid in the form of Common Shares and any subsequent dividends will be paid in cash or a combination of cash and Common Shares.

 Of the total distributions paid during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was distributed in cash, respectively. The Company may fund its cash distributions to shareholders from any source of funds available to the Company, including but not limited to offering proceeds, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to it on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and expense support from the Advisor, which is subject to recoupment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a portion of the Company s distributions resulted from expense support from the Advisor, and future distributions may result from expense support from the Advisor, each of which is subject to repayment by the Company within three years from the date of payment. Shareholders should understand that any such distribution is not based solely on the Company s investment performance, and can only be sustained if the Company achieves positive investment performance in future periods and/or the Advisor continues to provide expense support. Shareholders should also understand that the Company s future repayments of expense support will reduce the distributions that they would otherwise receive. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the performance necessary to sustain these distributions, or be able to pay distributions at all. Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a GAAP basis, include required adjustments to GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Kennedy Lewis Capital Company we , us , our and the Company and the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Forward Looking Statements 
 Statements contained in this Form 10-Q (including those relating to current and future market conditions and trends in respect thereof) that are not historical facts are based on current expectations, estimates, projections, opinions and/or beliefs of the Company, its advisor, Kennedy Lewis Capital Holdings LLC (in such capacity, the Advisor ), a Delaware limited liability company that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ), Kennedy Lewis Investment Management LLC and/or its affiliates (collectively, Kennedy Lewis ). Any such forward-looking statements may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend, target, goals, plan, forecast, project, other variations on these words or comparable terminology, or the negative of these words. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and we cannot assure you that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as well as the risk factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of our registration statement on Form N-2 filed on June 18, 2024 (the N-2 Registration Statement and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially include, but are not limited to, changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, and future changes in laws or regulations and conditions in our operating areas. 
 We have based the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q on information available to us on the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements, unless we are required to do so by applicable law. However, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC. 
 In addition to factors previously disclosed in our SEC reports, including the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section of our N-2 Registration Statement and those identified elsewhere in this report, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: 
 The Company is a new company with limited operating history. 

The Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company (a BDC ), under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ), which imposes numerous restrictions on the activities of the Company, including restrictions on leverage and on the nature of its investments. 

The Company intends to invest primarily in privately-held companies for which very little public information exists. Such companies are also generally more vulnerable to economic downturns and may experience substantial variations in operating results. 

The privately-held companies and below-investment-grade securities in which the Company will invest will be difficult to value and are illiquid. 

Defaults by portfolio companies will harm the Company s operating results. 

56 

Investment in the Company is suitable only for sophisticated investors and requires the financial ability and willingness to accept the high risks and lack of liquidity inherent in an investment in the Company. 

An investment in our common shares of beneficial interest (the Common Shares is not suitable for you if you might need access to the money you invest in the foreseeable future. 

You should not expect to be able to sell your Common Shares, regardless of how we perform. Because you may not be able to sell your shares, you will be unable to reduce your exposure on any market downturn. 

Our Common Shares are not currently listed on an exchange and given that we have no current intention of pursuing any such listing, it is unlikely that a secondary trading market will develop for our Common Shares. The purchase of our Common Shares is intended to be a long-term investment. 

Our distributions are not guaranteed, and if made, may be funded from sources other than cash flow from operations, including the sale of assets, borrowings, return of capital or offering proceeds. Although we generally expect to fund distributions from cash flow from operations, we have not established limits on the amounts we may pay from such sources. 

Distributions may also be funded in significant part, directly or indirectly, from temporary waivers or expense reimbursements borne by the Advisor or its affiliates, that may be subject to reimbursement to the Advisor or its affiliates. The repayment of any amounts owed to our affiliates will reduce future distributions to which investors would otherwise be entitled. 

We use and expect to continue to use leverage, which will magnify the potential for loss on amounts invested in us. 

The Company is subject to risks associated with the current interest rate environment and to the extent the Company uses debt to finance its investments, changes in interest rates will affect the cost of capital and net investment income. 

High interest rates and interest rate volatility, including volatility associated with the decommissioning of the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and the transition to new floating rate benchmarks, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR"), may adversely affect the Company s business and results of operations. 

The Company depends upon Kennedy Lewis, the Advisor and Kennedy Lewis Management LP (in such capacity, the Administrator for its success and upon their access to investment professionals. 

The Company operates in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. 

The Company s debt investments may be risky and could result in the loss of all or part of its investments. 

There are restrictions on holders of the Common Shares. 

There is a risk that investors may not receive distributions. 

We have implemented a share repurchase program, but only a limited number of Common Shares will be eligible for repurchase and repurchases will be subject to available liquidity and other significant restrictions. 

The Company is operating in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty. 

The Company s regulatory structure and tax status as a BDC and a regulated investment company (a RIC could limit certain of the Company s investments or negatively affect the Company s investment returns. 

57 

Future changes in laws or regulations and conditions in the Company s operating areas could have an adverse impact on the Company. 

You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligations to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate cash from (1) funds from investors in connection with such investors purchases of Common Shares, (2) cash flows from investments and operations, and (3) borrowings from banks or other lenders. Subject to prevailing market conditions, we intend to grow our portfolio of assets by raising additional capital, including through the prudent use of leverage available to us. 
 Our primary uses of cash are for (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (2) the cost of operations (including paying the Advisor and the Administrator), (3) debt service of any borrowings and (4) cash distributions to the Company s shareholders. 
 60 

Borrowings 
 We use borrowed funds, known as leverage, to make investments and to attempt to increase returns to our shareholders by reducing our overall cost of capital. As a BDC, we are limited in the amount of leverage we can incur under the 1940 Act. We are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150 after such borrowing. As of September 30, 2024, we had 278.016 million par value of outstanding borrowings and our asset coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings was 242.24 , compliant with the minimum asset coverage level of 150 generally required for a BDC by the 1940 Act. 
 We expect to maintain adequate liquidity and compliance with regulatory and contractual asset coverage requirements.

Common Shares issued pursuant to the Private Offering are reclassified as Class I shares to conform with current period presentation. 
 
 Distributions 
 Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the record date. The amount to be distributed, if any, is determined by the Board each quarter, and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by the Advisor. The Company intends to distribute net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually out of the assets legally available for such distributions. However, the Company may decide in the future to retain such capital gains for investment, incur a corporate-level tax on such capital gains, and elect to treat such capital gains as deemed distributions to shareholders. 
 In addition, we have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan ("DRP"), pursuant to which each shareholder will receive dividends in the form of additional Common Shares unless they notify the Company that they instead desire to receive cash or a combination of cash and Common Shares as set forth below. If a shareholder receives dividends in the form of Common Shares, dividend proceeds that otherwise would have been distributed in cash will be retained by the Company for reinvestment. Shareholders who receive dividends and other distributions in the form of Common Shares generally are subject to the same U.S. federal tax consequences as investors who elect to receive their distributions in cash; however, since their cash dividends will be reinvested, those investors will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes on re-invested dividends. A shareholder may elect to receive dividends and other distributions in cash or a combination of cash and Common Shares by notifying the Company in the manner set forth in the shareholder s Subscription Agreement at least 5 business days prior to the dividend or distribution declaration date fixed by the Board for such dividend. If such notice is received by the Company less than 5 business days prior to the relevant dividend or distribution declaration date, then that dividend will be paid in the form of Common Shares and any subsequent dividends will be paid in cash or a combination of cash and Common Shares. 
 The following tables summarize the distributions paid and Common Shares issued pursuant to the DRP for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively:

(1) Common Shares issued during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 relate to the Private Offering and became Class I shares as part of Public Offering effective June 24, 2024. Common Shares issued pursuant to the Private Offering are reclassified as Class I shares to conform with current period presentation. 
 
 Of the total distributions paid during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, 1,002,963 and 1,643,121 was distributed in cash, respectively. 
 
 The Company may fund its cash distributions to shareholders from any source of funds available to the Company, including but not limited to offering proceeds, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to it on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and expense support from the Advisor, which is subject to recoupment. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a portion of the Company s distributions resulted from expense support from the Advisor, and future distributions may result from expense support from the Advisor, each of which is subject to repayment by the Company within three years from the date of payment. Shareholders should understand that any such distribution is not based solely on the Company s investment performance, and can only be sustained if the Company achieves positive investment performance in future periods and/or the Advisor continues to provide expense support. Shareholders should also understand that the Company s future repayments of expense support will reduce the distributions that they would otherwise receive. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the performance necessary to sustain these distributions, or be able to pay distributions at all. 
 
 Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a GAAP basis, include required adjustments to GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions. The following table presents the sources of distributions on a GAAP basis that the Company declared on its Common Shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively:

Taxation as a RIC 
 We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary taxable income or capital gains that we distribute as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our shareholders. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must timely distribute to our shareholders, for each tax year, an amount equal to at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and the excess of any net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses and other taxable income other than any net capital gain reduced by deductible expenses. 
 Additionally, in order to avoid the imposition of a U.S. federal excise tax, we are required to distribute, in respect of each calendar year, dividends to our shareholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of 98 of our calendar year net ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses); 98.2 of our capital gain in excess of its capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year; and any undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any reason and become subject to corporate tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company accrued capital gains incentive fees of (78,801) and 747,254, respectively, of which none was payable on such date under the Advisory Agreement. 
 SEC Exemptive Relief 
 As a BDC, the Company is subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making its investments. For example, BDCs generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price and quantity are the only negotiated terms. On March 6, 2023, the SEC issued an order (the Co-Investment Order granting the Company s application for exemptive relief to co-invest, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, in certain private placement transactions, with other funds managed by the Advisor or its affiliates. Under the terms of the Co-Investment Order, in order for the Company to participate in a co-investment transaction, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Company s independent trustees must conclude that (i) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching with respect of the Company or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned, and (ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s shareholders and is consistent with the Company s investment objectives and strategies and certain criteria established by the Board. 
 On June 18, 2024, the SEC issued the Multi-Class Order granting the Company s application for exemptive relief from sections 18(a)(2), 18(c), 18(i) and 61(a) under the 1940 Act. Under the terms of the Multi-Class Order, the Company is permitted to offer multiple classes of its Common Shares with varying sales loads and asset-based distribution and/or service fees. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 The Company has entered into an Expense Support Agreement with the Advisor, pursuant to which the Advisor has contractually agreed to pay Other Operating Expenses (as defined below) of the Company on the Company s behalf (each such payment, a Required Expense Payment such that Other Operating Expenses of the Company do not exceed 1.00 (on an annualized basis) of the Company s applicable quarter-end net asset value. Other Operating Expenses include the Company s organizational and offering expenses (including the Company s allocable portion of compensation and overhead (including rent, office equipment and utilities) and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, excluding Base Management Fees and Incentive Fees owed to the Advisor and any interest expenses owed by the Company. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements Related Party Transactions for additional information. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total expense support provided by the Advisor since inception was 3,985,816. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Other than payment of fees under the Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement noted in the Related Party Transactions and Agreements section, we had no payment obligations for repayment of debt and other 
 65 

contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024. For additional information on the fees under the Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement, see Note 3 Related Party Transactions. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 From time-to-time we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the needs of our investment in portfolio companies. Such instruments include commitments to extend credit and may involve, in varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of amounts recognized on our balance sheet. Prior to extending such credit, we attempt to limit our credit risk by conducting extensive due diligence, obtaining collateral where necessary and negotiating appropriate financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 15,319,247 and 8,336,031 in unfunded delayed draw term loan commitments, 5,153,131 and 6,067,963 in unfunded revolver commitments and 33,020,490 and 0 in unfunded term loan commitments, respectively. 
 Commitments 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may enter into future funding commitments. We maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy any unfunded commitments, including cash on hand and available borrowings to fund such unfunded commitments. Please refer to Note 6 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements Commitments and Contingencies for further detail of these unfunded commitments. 
 Recent Developments 
 We have evaluated recent developments through the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements and determined that there are no recent developments outside the ordinary scope of business that require adjustment to, or disclosure in, the consolidated financial statements, other than those disclosed below. 
 Amendment to the Secured Credit Facility

 RIC Election 
 
 On October 15, 2024, the Company elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. 
 Distributions 
 
 On November 13, 2024, the Board of Trustees declared a distribution of 0.69 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, payable on January 28, 2025 to shareholders of record on November 29, 2024. 
 Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies 
 66 

The Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company is an investment company and accordingly follows the investment company accounting and reporting guidance of the FASB ASC Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies. These consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments that in the opinion of management are necessary for the fair statement of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented herein. 
 While our significant accounting policies are also described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements Significant Accounting Policies , we believe the following accounting policies require the most significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 In accordance with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Advisor as the Company s Valuation Designee . The Advisor has established a Valuation Committee that is responsible for determining in good faith the fair value of the Company s investments in instances where there is no readily available market quotation. A readily available market quotation is not expected to exist for most of the investments in the Company s portfolio, and the Company values these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee. Investments for which market quotations are readily available may be priced by independent pricing services. The Company has retained an external, independent valuation firm to provide data and valuation analyses on the Company s portfolio companies. 
 The Advisor values the Company s investments based on the type of financial instrument as outlined below: 
 Securities that are listed on a securities, commodities or futures exchange or market (including such securities when traded in the after hours market), will be valued (i) at their last sales prices on the date of determination on the primary exchange on which such securities were traded on such date, or (ii) at their last sales prices on the consolidated tape if such securities on the primary exchange on which such securities were traded on such date were reported on the consolidated tape, or (iii) in the event that the date of determination is not a date upon which an exchange was open for trading, on the date on which such exchange was previously open but not more than 10 days prior to the date of determination. 
 Securities that are not listed on an exchange but are traded over the counter will be valued at representative bid quotations if held long and representative asked quotations if held short, unless included in the NASDAQ National Market System, in which case they will be valued based upon their last sales prices (if such prices are available); provided that if the last sales price of a security does not fall between the last bid and asked price for such security on such date, the Advisor will value such security at the mean between the last bid and asked price for such security on such date. Securities not denominated in U.S. dollars will be translated into U.S. dollars at prevailing exchange rates as the Advisor may reasonably determine. All other investments will be assigned such value as the Advisor may reasonably determine. When available, quotations from brokers or pricing services will be considered in the valuation process. For example, the Advisor will utilize indicative prices from brokers or pricing services to determine the fair value of bonds and bank debt and may internally validate the quotes obtained or utilize the mean of the bid (if long) and ask (if short) quotes obtained. For these quotes to be considered for valuation purposes they must be sent directly from the brokers to the Advisor. If quotations are not readily available through pricing services or brokers for a security, financial instrument or other property, the Advisor will determine its value in such manner as the Advisor, in its sole discretion, reasonably determines. This is generally achieved by engaging a third party valuation firm to value such securities and provide a range of values for each position. The Advisor will then mark the position within that range. 
 The determination of fair value generally considers factors such as comparisons to public companies, comparable transactions, markets in which a company does business, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, discounted cash flows, earnings and ability to make payments, and market yields. If an event such as a purchase, sale, or public offering occurs, the Advisor may consider the pricing indicated by such event to corroborate its internal valuation. 
 FASB ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. ASC 820 also provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which 
 67 

prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings and provides for enhanced disclosures determined by the level of information used in the valuation. 
 The Company classifies the inputs used to measure fair values into the following hierarchy: 
 Level 1 Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible to the Company at the measurement date. 

Level 2 Valuations are based on similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable. 

Level 3 Valuations are based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models incorporating significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flow models and other similar valuation techniques. The valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities generally requires significant management judgment due to the inability to observe inputs to valuation. 

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of observable input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Advisor s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and it considers factors specific to the investment. 
 Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the period in which the transfer occurs. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Advisor applies the valuation policy approved by the Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, the Advisor evaluates the source of inputs, including any markets in which its investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), the Advisor subjects those prices to various additional criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, the Advisor reviews pricing provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices obtained as well as an assessment as to their quality, such as the depth of the relevant market relative to the size of the Company s position. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 In addition, changes in the market environment, including the impact of changes in broader market indices and credit spreads, and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. 
 Investment Related Transactions, Revenue Recognition and Expenses 
 Investment transactions and the related revenue and expenses are recorded on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses are recorded upon the sale or liquidation of investments and are calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or liquidation, if any, and the cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the difference between the fair value of the investments and the cost basis of the investments. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of discounts and amortizations of premiums. Discounts from and premiums to par value on debt investments purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. 
 68 

Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income. 
 In the general course of its business, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees may include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and loan waiver amendment fees, and commitment fees, and are recorded as other income in investment income when earned. 
 Certain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind PIK interest. PIK represents accrued interest that is added to the principal amount of the investment on the interest payment date rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon the investment being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest income. Because the Company has elected to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income purposes under Subchapter M of the Code, therefore, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to shareholders in the form of distributions, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash. 
 Receivable for investments sold and payable for investments purchased represent unsettled investments. 
 
 Foreign Currency Hedging 
 To the extent that we hold instruments denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we may enter into transactions to offset the potential adverse effects of changes in currency exchange rates. In particular, we may use currency forward contracts and other currency-related derivatives to mitigate this risk. 
 69 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to certain financial market risks, such as interest rate fluctuations. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. The U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks have raised interest rates multiple times in recent years. As a result, key base interest rates, such as SOFR and EURIBOR, may fluctuate over time. As of September 30, 2024, 93.27 of investments at fair value represent floating-rate investments. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income and expenses, should interest rates increase or decrease by 100, 200 or 300 basis points. Assuming that the interim and unaudited Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our interest rate sensitivity as of such date, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table.

Down 300 basis points 

(16,356,829) 

(8,340,480) 

(8,016,349) 

Because we may borrow money to make investments, our net investment income may be dependent on the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. In periods of increasing interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which may reduce our net investment income. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act we evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our President and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level that we would meet our disclosure obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the 1934 Act) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
