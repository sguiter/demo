RUBICON TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

million, accounts receivable totaled 84.4 million and unbilled accounts receivable totaled million. Availability under the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility, which provided the ability to borrow up to million, was million, and the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on March 9, 2025. In conjunction to the sale of SaaS Business, the Company also entered into side letters with lenders of the June 2023 Term Loan, the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility, and the December 2021 Subordinated Term Loan. All side letters required the Company to initiate a sale process to sell all or substantially all of the equity interests and assets of the Company within 300 days of the completion of the sale of SaaS Business on May 7, 2024. The letter required two milestones of the sale process, (i) within four months of May 7, 2024, the Company should enter into a binding letter of intent to consummate the sale of the Company and (ii) within ten months of May 7, 2024, the Company should consummate the sale of the Company and repay the outstanding balances of the debts in full. If any of the milestones are not met and such failure is not cured by the Company in accordance with such terms, the outstanding balances for the June 2023 Term Loan, the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility, and the December 2021 Subordinated Term Loan will become due in full within ten months of May 7, 2024. The Company is currently exploring refinancing options, which are not yet finalized. The side letters effectively accelerate the maturity of the June 2023 Term Loan, the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility, and the December 2021 Subordinated Term Loan, resulting in potential negative impacts on the Company s cash position and liquidity. Pursuant to the Cantor Sales Agreement (as defined in Note 12), the Company may offer and sell up to million shares of Class A Common Stock through Cantor. However, it is uncertain how quickly Cantor will be able to sell such shares of Class A Common Stock at the price the Company requests to deliver additional liquidity to the Company. 

The Company currently projects that it will not have sufficient cash on hand or available liquidity under existing arrangements to meet the Company s projected liquidity needs for the next 12 months. As a result, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

To address liquidity needs, the Company has been working to execute various initiatives to modify its operations to reduce spending and improve cash flow. Initiatives the Company has undertaken in recent periods include (i) increased focus on operational efficiencies and cost reduction measures, (ii) eliminating redundancies that have been the byproduct of the Company s recent growth and expansion, (iii) evaluating the Company s portfolio and less profitable accounts to better ensure the Company is deploying resources efficiently, and (iv) exercising strict capital discipline for future investments, such as requiring investments to meet minimum hurdle rates. Additionally, on May 7, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its SaaS Business (see Note 3 for further information) and entered into the Rodina SPA (see Note 11 for further information) which provided the Company with additional cash. 

The Company is currently exploring refinancing options, which are not yet finalized. The Company believes that additional capital will be needed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet the Company s known liquidity needs for the next 12 months given that the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility is scheduled to mature and the borrowings under the facility will become due and payable on the maturity date. However, while management believes the Company will be able to obtain additional capital through debt and equity financing, including sales of Class A Common Stock under the Cantor Sales Agreement, to the extent necessary, the Company has obtained no firm commitment from current or prospective investors to date and no assurance can be provided that such additional financing will be obtained at the level acceptable to the Company within the necessary timeframe, if at all. Failure to secure sufficient additional funding in a timely manner or at all will impact the Company s liquidity, including its ability to service its debt and other liabilities, and may require the Company to modify, delay, or abandon some of its planned future expansion or development, or to otherwise enact additional operating cost reductions available to management, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, operating results, financial condition, and could force the Company to limit its business activities or discontinue its operations entirely. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

million and million, respectively. 

In cases where customers pay for services in arrears, the Company accrues revenue in advance of billings as long as the criteria for revenue recognition are met, thus creating a contract asset (unbilled receivable). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s continuing operations had unbilled receivables of million and million, respectively. These unbilled balances were the result of services provided in the period, but not yet billed to the customer. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company invoiced its customers million pertaining to contract assets for services delivered prior to December 31, 2023. As further described in Note 3, million and million of contract assets were classified to current assets of discontinued operations on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) consist of amounts collected prior to having satisfied the performance obligation. The Company periodically invoices customers for recurring front load services in advance monthly basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s continuing operations had deferred revenue balances of million and million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million of revenue that was included in the contract liabilities balance as of December 31, 2023. As further described in Note 3, million and million of contract liabilities were classified to current liabilities held for sale on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

per share Class A Common Stock ), among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 

For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded in liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the liability-classified warrants are recognized as a component of other income (expense) on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

shares of Class A Common Stock (the Earn-Out Class A Shares and (ii) Rubicon Continuing Unitholders (as defined in Note 3) immediately before the Closing received a right to receive a pro rata portion of Class B Units (as defined in Note 3) Earn-Out Units and an equivalent number of shares of the Company s Class V common stock, par value Class V Common Stock ( Earn-Out Class V Shares , and together with Earn-Out Class A Shares and Earn-Out Units, Earn-Out Interests ), in each case, depending upon the performance of Class A Common Stock during the five-year period after the Closing (the Earn-Out Period ), as set forth below upon satisfaction of any of the following conditions (each, an Earn-Out Condition ): 

(1) 
 50 of the Earn-Out Interests if the volume weighted average price (the VWAP of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds 112.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, and recapitalizations) for twenty (20) of thirty (30) consecutive trading days during the Earn-Out Period; and 

(2) 
 50 of the Earn-Out Interests if the VWAP of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds 128.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, and recapitalizations) for twenty (20) of any thirty (30) consecutive trading days during the Earn-Out Period. 

The Company accounts for these Earn-Out Interests as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms (as further defined in Note 3) and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). 

Earn-Out Interests were classified as liability transactions at initial issuance, which offset against additional paid-in capital as of the Closing. At each period end, Earn-Out Interests are remeasured to their fair value, with the changes during that period recognized as a component of other income (expense) on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Upon issuance and release of the shares after each Earn-Out Condition is met, the related Earn-Out Interests will be remeasured to their fair value at that time with the changes recognized as a component of other income (expense), and such Earn-Out Interests will be reclassed to stockholders deficit on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Earn-Out Interests had a fair value of thousand and million, respectively, with the changes in the fair value of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, recognized as a gain on change in fair value of earn-out liabilities under other income (expense) within the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes ASC Topic 740 ), which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities by applying the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Such net tax effects on temporary differences are reflected on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when the Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company calculates the interim tax provision in accordance with the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-270, Income Taxes; Interim Reporting . For interim periods, the Company estimates the annual effective income tax rate AETR and applies the estimated rate to the year-to-date income or loss before income taxes. 

ASC Topic 740 prescribes a two-step approach for the recognition and measurement of tax benefits associated with the positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has no tax positions that met this threshold and, therefore, has not recognized such benefits. The Company has reviewed and will continue to review the conclusions reached regarding uncertain tax positions, which may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on ongoing analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. To the extent that the Company s assessment of the conclusions reached regarding uncertain tax positions changes as a result of the evaluation of new information, such change in estimates will be recorded in the period in which such determination is made. The Company reports income tax-related interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as a component of income tax expense. 

The Company s income tax benefit was million and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with an effective tax rate of and ) , respectively. The Company s income tax benefit was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with an effective tax rate of and ) , respectively. The provision for income taxes differs from the amount that would result from applying statutory rates primarily due to the changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance including a release of valuation allowance on net operating losses, expense related to the gain on the sale of the SaaS business, loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, and differences in the deductibility of certain book and tax expenses, including the changes in fair value of earn-out liabilities, warrant liabilities and derivatives. The Company s net operating losses utilized are limited under Section 382 and were generated during 2022. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. The Company intends to maintain this position until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowance. The Company also has certain assets with indefinite lives for which the basis is different for book and tax. As a result, the Company is in a net deferred tax liability position of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The Company accounts for the effects of these increases in tax basis and associated payments under the TRAs if and when exchanges occur as follows: 

a. 
 recognizes a contingent liability for the TRA obligation when it is deemed probable and estimable, with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in-capital, based on the estimate of the aggregate amount that the Company will pay; 

b. 
 records an increase in deferred tax assets for the estimated income tax effects of the increases in tax basis based on enacted federal and state tax rates at the date of the exchange; 

c. 
 to the extent the Company estimates that the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset will not be fully realized based on an analysis that will consider, among other things, the expectation of future earnings, the Company reduces the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance; and 

d. 
 the effects of changes in any of the estimates and subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates after the initial recognition will be included in the Company s net loss. 

A TRA liability is determined and recorded under ASC 450, Contingencies , as a contingent liability; therefore, the Company is required to evaluate whether the liability is both probable and the amount can be estimated. Since the TRA liability is payable upon cash tax savings and the Company has not determined that positive future taxable income is probable based on the Company s historical loss position and other factors that make it difficult to rely on forecasts, the Company has not recorded the TRA liability as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. The Company will evaluate this on a quarterly basis, which may result in an adjustment in future periods.

Business Disposition 

On May 7, 2024, the Company completed the sale of the SaaS Business to an entity affiliated with Andres Chico, chairman of the Company s board of directors, and Jose Miguel Enrich, a beneficial owner of greater than 10 of the issued and outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock. The total consideration was million, which was calculated based on total closing date consideration of 68.2 million minus the working capital adjustment of million. In conjunction with the sale of the SaaS business, on May 7, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement or SPA with MBI Holdings, LP (the Buyer ), which is also commonly controlled by Andres Chico and Jose Miguel Enrich. Pursuant to the SPA, the Company issued and sold to the Buyer shares of Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, at par value per share (the Preferred Stock ), for an aggregate purchase price of million. The Company evaluated both events and identified two units of accounting, which is the Asset Purchase Agreement APA of the sale of the SaaS business and the SPA of the issuance of Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock. As such, the total cash proceeds from the sale of the SaaS business and the issuance of Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock were allocated between the two transactions based on the relative fair value of the SaaS business and the Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, resulting in million allocated to the sale of the SaaS business and million allocated to the issuance of the Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (See Note 11). 

The APA provides a potential earn-out payment to the Company of 12.5 million if the SaaS Business, after the transaction, achieves a certain annual recurring revenue target on or prior to December 31, 2024. The potential earn-out payment will be decreased by the amount of contingent payment of 2.5 million from the Take-private Transaction discussed below. Given that the earn-out payment depends on the SaaS business sold achieving a certain level of annual recurring revenue target, the earn-out consideration is not accounted for as derivative. The Company records the earn-out consideration at its fair value at the transaction date and determined that the fair value of the earn-out payment was 0.3 million at the closing of the transaction on May 7, 2024, and recognized a million contingent consideration receivable included in other current assets on its condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 since the fair value of the earn-out consideration did not change significantly. The Company will perform subsequent assessments at each reporting date to evaluate and adjust the fair value for the receivable, if needed. 

Additionally, the APA also provides a contingent payment of 2.5 million from the Buyer if the shareholder approval of a Take-private Transaction with the Buyer or the Buyer s affiliates occurs prior to December 31, 2024. In order for the Company to receive the contingent payment of 2.5 million, a business combination, a merger, or other change of control must occur between the Buyer or the Buyer s Affiliates or the Buyer s Parent resulting in a delisting and deregistration of the Company s stock with the SEC. The payment of the 2.5 million is based on a binary event, which is a business combination, which either occurs or does not occur and is outside the control of the Company. Therefore, this contingent payment of 2.5 million is recognized when it occurs. 

To determine the gain derived from the sale of the SaaS business, the Company performed the calculation based on the allocated proceeds of the sale of the SaaS business and the closing balances of the SaaS businesses reported as of May 7, 2024, which consisted of total assets in the amount of million, total liabilities of million, for a net assets disposed of million, compared to the allocated proceeds of million. As such, the Company recognized million in gain from the sale of the SaaS business on May 7, 2024. 

The Company has only one reporting unit and evaluates goodwill for impairment at the single reporting unit level. As a result, there is no goodwill assigned specifically to the SaaS business and goodwill pertaining to the sale of the SaaS business is allocated based on the relative fair value of the SaaS Business and the remaining business. As such, the Company allocated goodwill in the amount of 11.4 million to the SaaS business at the close of the sale on May 7, 2024, at which such goodwill was part of total assets in the gain calculation above.

In accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments , the Company concluded that these Revolving Credit Facility amendments were debt modifications. 

On June 7, 2023, the Company fully prepaid the borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of million and terminated the facility.

The June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility bears an interest rate of SOFR plus (or 3.95 if the Company meets certain conditions defined in the agreement) as of September 30, 2024). The borrowing capacity is calculated based on the Company s borrowing base collateral as defined in the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility agreement, which is comprised of qualified billed and unbilled receivables and the September 2023 Rodina Letter of Credit (as defined below). The fee on the average daily balance of unused loan commitments is 0.5 . Interest and fees are payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month. 

The June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility requires a lockbox arrangement, which provides for receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding at the discretion of the lender. This arrangement, combined with the existence of the subjective acceleration clause in the Line of Credit agreement, necessitates the Line of Credit be classified as a current liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The acceleration clause allows for amounts borrowed under the facility to become immediately due in the event of a material adverse change in the Company s business condition (financial or otherwise), operations, properties or prospects, change of management, or change in control. 

On September 22, 2023, an entity affiliated with Andres Chico and Jose Miguel Enrich issued a standby letter of credit in the amount of 15.0 million (the September 2023 Rodina Letter of Credit to the lender of the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility on behalf of the Company, which increased the Company s borrowing base collateral under the facility by 15.0 million.

On December 5, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility. The amendment temporally modified the calculation methodology of the borrowing base collateral, resulting in its increase by 5.0 million through January 15, 2024, which was subsequently extended to March 15, 2024 with an option to be further extended to June 15, 2024. To date, the modified calculation methodology of the borrowing base has been extended on a month-to-month basis. 

On May 7, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility. Pursuant to the amendment, (i) the lender consented to the SaaS Business sale and (ii) the Company agreed to make a partial prepayment of million upon close of the sale of SaaS Business. Concurrently, the Company executed a side letter with the lender of the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility, which included additional non-financial covenants for certain time-based milestones in relation to potential transactions the Company may enter into in future periods, including an agreement of a sale of all or substantially all of the Company s equity interests and assets or a merger. The side letter required the Company to initiate a sale process within 300 days of the completion of the sale of SaaS Business on May 7, 2024. The letter required two milestones of the sale process, (i) within four months of May 7, 2024, the Company should enter into a binding letter of intent to consummate the sale of the Company and (ii) within ten months of May 7, 2024, the Company should consummate the sale of the Company and repay the outstanding balance of the debts in full. If any of the milestones are not met and such failure is not cured by the Company in accordance with such terms, the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility will become due in full within ten months of May 7, 2024. The Company prepaid the 11.4 million at the close of the sale of SaaS Business on May 7, 2024. The prepayment did not result a change in the borrowing capacity of June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility. 

In accordance with ASC 470-50, the Company concluded that these Revolving Credit Facility amendments were debt modifications and not extinguishments. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company s total outstanding borrowings under the Line of Credit were million and no amount remained available to draw, after accounting for all the changes discussed above. The June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility is subject to certain financial covenants.

The holder further indicated that a recuperation of the difference between the value of the in-scope warrant issued and sale value of such warrant will be required and the settlement will be paid in cash when the Company becomes private. The Company remeasured the fair value of the derivative to the settlement amount of million on the agreement execution date, derecognized the derivative liabilities, and recognized the settlement amount as accrued expense in other current liabilities as of September 30, 2024.

On August 25, 2023 (the Market Price Set Date ), the YA Convertible Debentures were converted into shares of Class A Common Stock for the full settlements, and the YA Warrant became exercisable at the conversion price of 4.52 per share. The conversion price is to be adjusted to the lowest of (a) the 3-month Reset Price , which is the average of the daily VWAPs of Class A Common Stock per share during the three consecutive trading days immediately following the 3-month anniversary of the Market Price Set Date, or (b) the 6-month Reset Price , which is the average of the daily VWAPs of Class A Common Stock per share during the three consecutive trading days immediately following the 6-month anniversary of the Market Price Set Date, in case (a) or (b) is lower than 4.52 per share. The 3-month Reset Price was set at 2.80 per share in November 2023 and the 6-month Reset Price was set at 0.76 per share in February 2024. 

The Company initially determined that the YA Warrant required liability classification pursuant to ASC 480 until the 6-month Reset Price was set on February 28, 2024. While the YA Warrant was liability classified, the outstanding YA Warrant was recognized as warrant liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, measured at its inception date fair value and subsequently remeasured at each reporting period with changes being recorded as a component of other income (expense) on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued 499,975 shares of Class A Common Stock for partial exercise of the YA Warrant.

The Company determined that a tender offer or exchange event is outside the control of the Company and upon the consummation of a tender offer event it is possible that a change of control of the Company will not have occurred. As a result, the warrants could be cash settled upon an event outside the Company s control and it is possible that less than all or substantially all of the Class A Shares would be eligible to receive cash and the provision that would result in the cash settlement would not lead to a change in control of the Company due to the existence of the Class V shares. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued and shares of Class A Common Stock for partial exercise of the YA Warrant, respectively. No warrants were exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

If at any time on or before December 7, 2024, the Company issues additional shares of common stock (excluding any shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock under the Company s equity incentive plans existing as of the issue date), the number of the June 2023 Term Loan Warrants Shares issuable upon exercise immediately prior to such common stock issuance will be proportionately increased such that the percentage represented by the June 2023 Term Loan Warrants Shares in the Company s diluted common stock outstanding will remain the same. Additionally, the holders of the June 2023 Term Loan Warrants have the right to purchase up to the pro rata portion of any new common stock issuance by the Company up to 20.0 million in the aggregate, other than any issuance in connection with (i) any grant pursuant to any stock option agreement, employee stock purchase plan, or similar equity-based plan or compensation agreement, (ii) the conversion or exchange of any securities into shares of the Company s common stock, or the exercise of any option, warrant, or other right to acquire such shares, (iii) any acquisition by the Company of the stock, assets, properties, or business, (iv) any merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving the Company, or any other transaction or series of transactions resulting in a change of control of the Company and (v) any stock split, stock dividend, or similar recapitalization transaction.

The Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock include the following rights: 

Dividends The holders of the Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock are entitled to participate in all dividends declared on the common stock on an as-converted basis and are also entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 8 per annum, which will increase by 1 per annum starting on the second anniversary of the Original Issue Date and up to a maximum 11 per annum. The dividend rate is subject to increase under certain specified circumstances. The dividend will be accrued daily from the Original Issue Date, whether or not declared. In the event the dividends are not declared and paid, the dividends otherwise payable will continue to accrue daily and will be compounded quarterly. The cumulated dividend for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million and million, respectively. 

Liquidation In the event of any liquidation event, the holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, on a pari passu basis, assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders. The Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights on the distribution of assets in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, ranks pari passu with any parity securities, and ranks junior to secured and unsecured indebtedness and other senior class of stocks. The Preferred Stock has a Liquidation Preference equal to the greater of (i) the initial stated value of 1,000, increased by compound dividend and accrued but unpaid dividends per share (the Accumulated Stated Value ), and (ii) the amount per share of Preferred Stock that a holder would have received if such holder, immediately prior to such liquidation event, converted such share into common stock. The aggregate liquidation preference amount was million based on the Accumulated Stated Value at September 30, 2024. 

If the remaining assets available for distribution to stockholders were insufficient, the holders of the Preferred Stock will receive distributions ratably among the holders of Preferred Stock and common stock in proportion to the respective full preferential amounts. 

Voting Rights The holders of the Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock are entitled to vote as a single class with the holders of the common stock, with a vote equal to the number of shares of common stock into which the Preferred Stock could be converted. 

Conversion The Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock is convertible at any time into a number of shares of common stock based on a conversion rate set in accordance with the Certificate of Designations of the Preferred Stock. The conversion rate is calculated by dividing (i) the sum of (A) the Accumulated Stated Value, plus (B) compounded dividends (if such dividends have not yet been added to the Accumulated Stated Value) plus (C) accrued and unpaid dividends for the most recent period by (ii) the Conversion Price(initially 0.35 per share and is subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments) in effect immediately prior to the conversion. 

Anti-Dilution Adjustments The Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock is subject to anti-dilution adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including issuance of subdivisions or combination of common stock, stock dividends or distributions to holders of common stock, distribution of certain rights, options or warrants to holders of common stock, distribution of certain equity securities, indebtedness, other securities, assets or properties, tender offer, exchange offer, and the occurrence of reorganization events, subject to limitations set forth in the Certificate of Designations. 

Redemption The Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock is redeemable at any time after the latest maturity date (the first date on which the Company satisfies its obligation outlined in the Certificate of Designations of the Preferred Stock that does not cause an event of default under existing debt agreements) at the option of the holders into a number of shares of common stock based on a Redemption Price set in accordance with the Certificate of Designations of the Preferred Stock. The Redemption Price is calculated the greatest of (i) the Accumulated Stated Value, (ii) the product of (A) the number of shares of common stock such Preferred Stock is convertible into at the Conversion Price immediately prior to the redemption multiplied by (B) the greater of (x) the current market price of the Company s stock on the trading day prior to the redemption date and (y) the last reported sale price of the Company s stock on the trading day prior to the redemption date, and (iii) the product of 2 multiplied by the initial stated value of 1,000. The aggregate redemption amount was 20.6 million based on the Accumulated Stated Value at September 30, 2024. 

The Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the Company into a number of shares of common stock based on a Redemption Price upon a change of control that is outside of the Company s control. All of the Preferred Stock will be redeemed into a number of shares of common stock based on the Liquidation Preference upon the occurrence of an insolvency event. 

Registration Rights On May 7, 2024, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the RRA with the holders of the Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, pursuant to which, among other things, and on the terms and subject to certain limitations set forth therein, the Company was obligated to file a registration statement registering the sale or distribution of shares of common stock held by any holder, including any shares of common stock acquired by any holder pursuant to the conversion of the Preferred Stock, and any other securities upon the exercise of any option, warrant or right or the conversion or exchange of any convertible or exchangeable securities (the Registrable Securities ). In addition, pursuant to the RRA, the holders have the right to require the Company, subject to certain limitations, to effect a sale of any or all of their Registrable Securities by means of shelf registration and piggyback registration. 

The total cash proceeds from the issuance of the Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock and the sale of SaaS business were allocated to the two transactions based on the relative fair value of these transactions. Therefore, the Company recorded the issuance of the Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock at million, net of issuance costs of 0.4 million on the issuance date of May 7, 2024. The redeemable convertible preferred stock is classified outside of permanent equity as temporary equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. The Company has not adjusted the carrying value of the Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock since it was not probable of becoming redeemable at September 30, 2024. Subsequent adjustments to the carrying values will be made only when it becomes probable that such redemption will occur.

The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and contract assets and liabilities, approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities and are excluded from the fair value table above. 

Warrant liabilities The outstanding warrants which were classified as warrant liabilities, as of September 30, 2024, were the YA Warrant and the June 2023 Term Loan Warrants. 

The June 2023 Term Loan Warrants were classified as Level 2 as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The sole underlying asset of the outstanding warrant liabilities as of September 30, 2024, was Class A Common Stock, which is an observable input. However, the value of the warrants themselves was not directly or indirectly observable. The fair value of the warrant liabilities for the June 2023 Term Loan Warrants was estimated using the Black Scholes Merton model. The value of the June 2023 Term Loan Warrants is calculated by using the call price times the number of Class A shares in scope, which were as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The key assumption utilized was the probability of refinancing the June 2023 Term Loan in November 2024. The Company determined this probability to be approximately 95 for refinancing and 5 for not refinancing as of the date financial statements were available to be issued. 

The YA warrant liabilities were classified to Level 3 as of September 30, 2024 and Level 2 as of December 31, 2023, respectively. The sole underlying asset of the outstanding warrant liabilities as of September 30, 2024 was Class A Common Stock, which is an observable input, however the value of the warrants themselves were not directly or indirectly observable. The fair value of the warrant liabilities for the June 2023 Term Loan Warrants were determined based on price of the underlying share and the terms of each warrant, specifically whether each warrant is exercisable for a fixed number of shares of Class A Common Stock, hence the value of the total shares a warrant is exercisable for is variable, or a fixed value of shares of Class A Common Stock thus the number of the total shares a warrant is exercisable for is variable. The exercise prices of the liability-classified warrants which were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 were minimal per Class A Common Stock share) and did not have significant impact to the fair value measurements of these warrants. The fair value of the YA Warrant liability was determined using the redemption value of the warrant upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction, as defined in the Warrant Agreement. See Note 9 for further information regarding the warrant liabilities. 

Additional Subordinated Term Loan Warrants Derivative The Additional Subordinated Term Loan Warrants Derivative s fair value was estimated using a discounted cashflow/expected present value method. The value of the Additional Subordinated Term Loan Warrants earnout was million for each additional full calendar month after March 22, 2023 through June 22, 2023, and starting June 23, 2023, the value the Additional Subordinated Term Loan Warrants earn-out increases by 25,000 for each additional full calendar month thereafter until the Company repays the Subordinated Term Loan in full. The key assumption utilized was the probability of refinancing the Subordinated Term Loan in November 2024. The Company determined this probability to be approximately 95 for refinancing and 5 for not refinancing. As September 30, 2024, the Company applied a discount rate of to calculate the present value of the Additional Subordinated Term Loan Warrants Derivative. The Company measured and recognized fair value for the Additional Subordinated Term Loan Warrants Derivative at the end of each reporting period in derivative liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, with the respective fair value adjustment recorded in loss on change in fair value of derivatives as a component of other income (expense) on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Subordinated Term Loan Warrants Make-Whole Derivative The Subordinated Term Loan Warrants Make-Whole Derivative s fair value was estimated using Black Scholes Merton model. The value the Subordinated Term Loan Warrants Make-Whole Agreement is primarily based on the make-whole provision amount between (a) the closing share price of Class A Common Stock on the business day immediately prior to the lender s exercise of the Subordinated Term Loan Warrants on December 12, 2022 multiplied by the number of the December 2022 Warrant Shares and (b) the closing share price of Class A Common Stock on the business day immediately prior to the lender s sale of the December 2022 Warrant Shares multiplied by the number of the December 2022 Warrant Shares sold by the lender. 

The following table provides quantitative information of the key assumptions utilized in the Subordinated Term Loan Warrants Make-Whole Derivative fair value measurements as of measurement dates:

The Company measured and recognized fair value for the Subordinated Term Loan Warrants Make-Whole Derivative at the end of each reporting period in derivative liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, with the respective fair value adjustment recorded in loss on change in fair value of derivatives as a component of other income (expense) on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

million and million to these employees for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company further received a demand letter from a current employee for incentive equity compensation that the employee believes is due pursuant to an employment agreement with the Company. The Company is currently evaluating the demand letter and working to resolve the issue. 

On August 15, 2024, a lawsuit was filed against the Company by Jefferies LLC Jefferies in New York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan) (Jefferies LLC v. Rubicon Technologies, Inc.). Jefferies complaint alleges that the Company has failed to pay Jefferies a deferred discount fee of approximately 7,000,000 in breach of an Underwriting Agreement dated October 14, 2021, as amended, between Jefferies and the Company. On October 9, 2024, the Company filed an Answer responding to Jefferies complaint and denying the claims therein. Discovery in the case has not yet begun, but the Company plans to defend against Jefferies claims. 

The Company makes a provision for liabilities relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss that can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. At this time, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non-monetary remedies, with respect to the contingencies it faces, and the Company s estimates may not prove to be accurate. 

In management s opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations, cash flows or balance sheets. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute or other contingency, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Company s current or future results of operations or cash flows, or both. 

Management Rollover Settlement 

As further described in Note 6, during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company settled with certain Rubicon Management Rollover Holders a portion of the accrued management rollover consideration, included under accrued expenses account, and the Company agreed to make quarterly cash payments to these Rubicon Management Rollover Holders through December 31, 2026, of which million is coming due in the next 12 months of September 30, 2024, and million thereafter. 

Leases 

The Company leases its office facilities under operating lease agreements expiring through 2031. While each of the leases includes renewal options, the Company has only included the base lease term in its calculation of lease assets and liabilities as it is not reasonably certain to utilize the renewal options. The Company does not have any finance leases. 

Operating lease expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was thousand and million, respectively. Operating lease expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was thousand and million, respectively. The right-of-use assets balance at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is million and million, respectively. The weighted average discount rate is , with average remaining lease term of seven years. The Company paid million related to operating lease liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The following table presents information regarding the maturities of the undiscounted remaining operating lease payments, with a reconciliation to the amount of the liabilities representing such payments as presented on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands).

Sale of Business 

As disclosed in Note 3 Discontinued Operations and Business Disposition to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, on May 7, 2024, we completed the sale of our SaaS Business to an entity affiliated with Andres Chico and Jose Miguel Enrich, for a purchase price of 68.2 million. In connection with the Sale, the Company recognized a gain of 59.7 million on the sale of SaaS Business during the period ended September 30, 2024 presented within the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations. See Note 3 for additional information. The agreement also provides a potential earn-out payment of 12.5 million to us if the SaaS Business sales achieve a certain annual recurring revenue target on or prior to December 31, 2024. The APA also provides a contingent payment of 2.5 million from the Buyer if the shareholder approval of a Take-private Transaction with the Buyer or the Buyer s affiliates occurs prior to December 31, 2024. In order for the Company to receive the contingent payment of 2.5 million, a business combination, a merger, or other change of control must occur between the Buyer or the Buyer s Affiliates or the Buyer s Parent resulting in a delisting and deregistration of the Company s stock with the SEC. The potential earn-out payment 12.5 million will be decreased by the amount of contingent payment of 2.5 million received from the Take-private Transaction .

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 

Financial results from our operations and the growth and future success of our business are dependent upon many factors. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges that we must successfully address to sustain and grow our business. See also Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a discussion of key business and non-GAAP metrics that we use to help manage and evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. 

Industry trends and customers preference 

The waste and recycling industry is highly regulated and complex, and public policy is increasingly focused on improving diversion from landfills and reducing emissions. Current policies tend to encourage and reward reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, and many major cities in the United States have promulgated climate action plans committing to achieve emissions reductions. Additionally, the waste generators awareness of benefits achieved by improved diversion from landfills has been increasing, which we believe is and will continue to drive preference for recycling over landfills. We view these trends as an opportunity to accelerate the growth of our business, including our revenue and profitability. 

Commodity nature of our recycling program 

Through our recycling program, we market a variety of materials, including fibers such as old corrugated cardboard OCC ), old newsprint ONP ), aluminum, glass, pallets and other materials. Currently, OCC is the most significant material in our recycling program. Our recyclable commodity revenue is influenced by fluctuations in prices of the recyclable commodities. Periods of increasing prices generally provide the opportunity for higher revenue while periods of declining prices may result in declines in sales. For the reporting periods, the trend of the recyclable commodity prices was generally upward and contributed to higher recyclable commodity revenue in recent periods. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, our recyclable commodity revenue was 13.2 million and 12.1 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, our recyclable commodity revenue was 45.5 million and 40.8 million, respectively. 

We may use a number of strategies to mitigate impacts from recyclable commodity price fluctuations, including, entering into purchase contracts indexed to the recyclable commodity price such that we mitigate the variability in cash flows generated from the sales of recycled materials at floating prices. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. As of September 30, 2024, we were not a party to any recyclable commodity hedging agreements. 

44 

Investment in products 

We are actively investing in our business to support future growth and we expect this investment to continue. We have built a leading cloud-based digital marketplace that provides a transformational customer experience through an easy-to-use interface, where customers can manage services, track invoices, and view environmental outcomes. We believe that our platform is highly differentiated, and we expect to continue to invest in product development to further develop and enhance our platform s features and functionality to further extend the adoption of our platform. While we continue to invest in product development, we are focusing on operational efficiencies and cost reduction measures, such as rationalizing redundancies across the organization. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, our product development cost was 5.3 million and 7.6 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, our product development cost was 17.2 million and 21.6 million, respectively. We expect product development costs to decrease as a percentage of total revenues in the next 12 months. 

Components of Results of Operations 

Revenue 

We generate our revenue from waste removal, waste management and consultation services, platform subscriptions, and the sale of recyclable commodities. As discussed previously, we sold our SaaS Business on May 7, 2024. Therefore, platform subscriptions and related services have been discontinued as of May 7, 2024. 

Service revenue: 

Service revenue is comprised of waste removal and consultation services provided to customers for waste, recycling and logistics solutions. Services include planning, consolidation of billing and administration, cost savings analyses, vendor procurement and performance management, and a suite of solutions providing insights into the customers waste streams. 

Recyclable commodity revenue: 

We recognize recyclable commodity revenue through the sale of old corrugated cardboard OCC ), old newsprint (ONP), aluminum, glass, pallets and other recyclable materials. 

Cost of revenue, exclusive of amortization and depreciation 

Cost of service revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, including third-party hauler costs, costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, and employee-related costs such as salaries and benefits. Cost of recyclable commodity revenues is comprised of expenses related to purchases of recyclable materials and any associated transportation fees. 

As part of our services, we work with our customers to locate opportunities to reduce waste volume and service frequency with the intention to reduce costs for the customers which in turn leads to reduced costs for us. We are typically entitled to bill for a portion of such savings the customers realize as a result of our services in accordance with the terms of our customer contracts. 

Sales and marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and other incentives to our sales and marketing personnel, advertising expenses, digital marketing expenses, sales commissions and other promotional expenditures. 

45 

Product development 

Product development expenses consist primarily of compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and other benefits to our product development team, contract labor expenses and fees for software licenses, consulting, legal, and other services. 

General and administrative 

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits related costs, including equity-based compensation expense for our general corporate functions. General and administrative costs also consist of third-party professional service fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services, insurance charges, hosting fees and overhead costs. 

We expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of total revenues over the next several years as a result of our increased focus on operational efficiencies, planned cost reduction measures across the organization and the sale of our SaaS Business. We are working to eliminate redundancies across the organization, which were a byproduct of our growth and expansion phase the past few years. 

Gain on settlement of incentive compensation 

Gain on settlement of incentive compensation consists of a gain from settlements of the management rollover bonuses in connection with the Mergers. 

Gain (loss) on change in fair value of warrant liabilities 

This account consists of fair value changes of outstanding warrant liabilities of the Company. 

Loss on change in fair value of derivatives 

This account consists of fair value changes of Subordinated Term Loan Warrants Make-Whole derivative and Additional Subordinated Term Loan Warrants Derivative. 

Amortization and depreciation 

Amortization and depreciation consist of depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our property and equipment, acquired intangible assets and customer acquisition costs. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt issuance costs.

Revenue 

Total revenue from continuing operations increased by 14.0 million, or 8.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Service revenue increased by 12.9 million, or 8.3 , primarily due to increased services in the amount of 11.0 million, additional revenue from new customers and price increases of 25.1 million. The increase of revenue is partially offset by the loss of revenue from cancelled customer contracts in the amount of 21.1 million and decrease in volumes of 2.1 million. 

Revenue from sales of recyclable commodities increased by 1.1 million, or 9.0 , primarily due to a 2.6 million increase driven by higher sales prices of recyclable commodities, especially in OCC, decrease in volume of 0.1 million, and in addition to a 1.4 million decrease related to cancelled customers. 

Cost of revenue, exclusive of amortization and depreciation 

Total cost of revenue from continuing operations increased by 17.2 million, or 11.0 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cost of service revenue increased by 14.8 million, or 10.1 , primarily due to increases of approximately 19.9 million from new customers, 7.4 million from service expansions and volume increases, and 6.0 million due to price increase. This is offset by 18.5 million decreases associated with cancelled customer contracts. 

Cost of recyclable commodity revenue increased by 2.4 million, or 23.2 , primarily due to a 2.6 million increase in the cost of recyclable commodities sold, mainly driven by increase in the price of OCC, and increase of 0.7 million due to volume increases, and partially offset by a decrease of 0.9 million related to cancelled customers. 

Total cost of revenue from discontinued operations, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 0.8 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023, as there is no sale of discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Sales and marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were relatively unchanged, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Sales and marketing expenses from discontinued operations, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 1.1 million from three months ended September 30, 2023, as there is no sale of discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Product development 

Product development expenses from continuing operations decreased by 2.4 million, or 30.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Product development expenses from discontinued operations, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 0.7 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023, as there is no sale of discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

48 

General and administrative 

General and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by 6.9 million, or 50.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by a lower stock-based compensation of 1.3 million, a decrease of 0.7 million in salaries and wages due to lower headcount, a decrease of 0.9 in bad debt reserve due to certain write-offs, a decrease of 0.9 million in software licenses, a decrease of 0.7 million in outside services, a decrease of 0.4 million in employer payroll tax expense, a decrease of 1.2 million in bonus expense due to downward revision of 2024 bonus in the third quarter of 2024, and a decrease of 0.8 million in professional fees. 

General and administrative expenses from discontinued operations, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 0.2 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023, as there is no sale of discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Amortization and depreciation expenses from continuing operations decreased by 0.1 million, or 12.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in software amortization expense due to the sale of the SaaS business in May 2024. 

Amortization and depreciation expenses from discontinued operations, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were decreased by 0.3 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023, as there is no sale of discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Other income (expense) 

Other expense, net of other income, decreased by 15.1 million, or 84.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 9.3 million decrease of loss on extinguishment of debt obligations, a 1.2 million decrease in interest expenses, a 7.0 million decrease (from a 1.2 million loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to a 5.7 million gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024) in the gain or loss on change in fair value of derivatives, and a 0.6 million decrease in other expense. This is partially offset by a 0.2 million unfavorable decrease in gain on change in fair value of earn-out liabilities and by a 2.8 million unfavorable decrease in gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities.

Revenue 

Total revenue decreased by 10.8 million, or 2.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Service revenue decreased by 15.4 million, or 3.2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to cancelled customer contracts in the amount of 79.8 million and 3.5 million decrease in volumes related to remaining book of business, and a 1.2 million decrease related to cancelled customers, which were partially offset by an increase from expanded book of business accounts and increase in services in the amount of 28.6 million and 40.5 million from new customers and price increases. 

Revenues from sales of recyclable commodities increased by 4.7 million, or 11.4 , primarily due to a 12.6 million increase driven by the sales prices for recyclable commodities, especially in OCC. The increase was partially offset by a 6.2 million decreases related to cancelled customers and 1.7 million decrease related to pricing and sale of discontinued business in May 2024. 

Total revenue from discontinued operations decreased by 3.3 million to 4.1 million from 7.4 million, or 45.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is due to the sale of the SaaS business during the first half of the second quarter, in May 2024. 

Cost of revenue, exclusive of amortization and depreciation 

Total cost of revenue decreased by 1.9 million, or 0.4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cost of service revenue decreased by 8.1 million, or 1.8 , primarily due to 74.0 million decrease related to customer cancellations, and partially offset by 27.7 million from new customers, 15.3 million from price increases, and 22.9 million from service expansions and volume increases 

Cost of recyclable commodity revenue increased by 6.2 million or 17.4 , primarily due to a 12.7 million increase in OCC prices, and offset by a 6.5 decrease from customer cancellations. 

Total cost of revenue from discontinued operations decreased by 0.8 million to 1.4 million from 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Sales and marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 0.3 million or 5.1 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by a 0.4 million decrease in marketing content, a 0.5 million decrease in stock-based compensation for RSU, and partially offset by a 0.3 million increase in commission and a 0.3 million increase in incentive payout. 

Sales and marketing expenses from discontinued operations decreased by 0.7 million to 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to larger spending on marketing and demand generation activities during the first quarter. 

Product development 

Product development expenses decreased by 4.5 million, or 20.6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased consulting services related costs by 1.2 million, lower software license related costs by 1.3 million, lower workforce-related expense related costs by 2.4 million, and a decrease in employee administrative costs due to lower headcount in the amount of 0.5, offset by lower software development related costs by 0.9 million. 

51 

We expect the product development cost to decrease as a percentage of total revenues over the next 12 months. A significant component of the product development is expected to be a software services subscription cost with a certain PIPE Investor, which provides advanced data analytics capabilities to enhance the data security, visibility, models, and algorithms of our digital platform. See Contractual Obligations below for further information regarding the software services subscription. 

Product development expenses from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 1.0 million. The decrease is due to the lower product development expenses in the second quarter attributable to the sale of the SaaS business, in May 2024. 

General and administrative 

General and administrative expenses decreased by 15.0 million, or 33.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is driven by the following decreases: 2.5 million decrease in salaries and wages, a 11.2 million decrease in stock-based compensation for RSU, and a 1.3 million decrease in employee administrative costs. 

Gain on settlement of incentive compensation 

The gain on settlement of incentive compensation decreased by 18.6 million or 100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was attributable to replacing the 26.9 million of the accrued management rollover consideration with RSU awards, which was an event that did not repeat in 2024, offset by a 2.5 million decrease in salaries and wages, a 1.3 million decrease in employee administrative, a 0.9 million decrease in bonus, a 1.9 million decrease in software license, and a 1.8 million decrease in outside service. 

Amortization and depreciation 

Amortization and depreciation expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 0.4 million or 13.4 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 0.2 million decrease in depreciation expense due to fewer assets to depreciate due to write offs during 2023 and to a decrease of 0.2 million in software amortization due to the sale of the SaaS business in May 2024. 

Amortization and depreciation expenses from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to the sale of the SaaS business in May 2024, were 0.4 million, and relatively unchanged compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which were 0.8 million. 

Other income (expense) 

Other expenses, net of other income, decreased by 13.2 million or 37.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 2.6 million increase in interest expense, added to a 7.0 million decrease in gain on settlements in connection with the Mergers as this was a 2023 event that did not repeat in 2024, and a 5.3 million decrease in gain on change in fair value of earn-out liabilities, and offset by a 11.1 million increase in gain or loss on change in fair value of warrant liabilities, a 7.5 million increase in gain or loss on change in fair value of derivatives and a 9.5 million increase in loss on extinguishment of debt obligations. 

Net gain on sale of discontinued operations 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a gain of 59.7 million was recognized from the sale of the SaaS Business on May 7, 2024. As disclosed in Note 3 Discontinued Operations and Business Disposition to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, on May 7, 2024, we completed the sale of our SaaS Business to an entity affiliated with Andres Chico and Jose Miguel Enrich, from which we recognized a gain of 59.7 million during the second quarter in 2024 presented within the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations. See Note 3 for additional information. 

52 

Income tax expense 

Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were relatively unchanged compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, for the Company s continuing operations. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 1.7 million of income tax expense from discontinued operations was recorded due to the sale of the SaaS business on May 7, 2024. See Note 3 Discontinued Operations and Business Disposition to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information related to discontinued operations and the related sale. 

Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In addition to the measures presented in our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key business and non-GAAP metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. Key metrics and non-GAAP financial measures presented below include the results from both the continuing and discontinued operations. See Note 3 Discontinued Operations and Business Disposition , to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for the further information regarding the discontinued operations. 

Revenue net retention 

We believe our ability to retain customers is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. We calculate revenue net retention as a year-over-year comparison that measures the percentage of revenue recognized in the current quarter from customers retained from the corresponding quarter in the prior year. We believe that our revenue net retention rate is an important metric to measure overall client satisfaction and the general quality of our service offerings as it is a composition of revenue expansion or contraction within our customer accounts. 

Our revenue net retention rate was 101.3 and 91.1 as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin 

Adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which is calculated by adding back amortization and depreciation for revenue generating activities and platform support costs to GAAP gross profit, the most comparable GAAP measurement. Adjusted gross profit margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by total GAAP revenue. 

We believe adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin are important measures and useful to investors because they show the progress in scaling our digital platform by quantifying the markup and margin, we charge our customers that are incremental to our marketplace vendor costs. These measures demonstrate this progress because changes in these measures are driven primarily by our ability to optimize services for our customers, improve our hauling and recycling partners efficiency and achieve economies of scale on both sides of the marketplace. Our management team uses these non-GAAP measures as one of the means to evaluate the profitability of our customer accounts, exclusive of certain costs that are generally fixed in nature, and to assess how successful we are in achieving our pricing strategies. However, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate and use these measures differently or not at all, which may reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure. Further, these measures should not be read in isolation from or without reference to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

53 

The following table shows the calculation of GAAP gross profit and a reconciliation of (i) GAAP gross profit to non-GAAP adjusted gross profit and GAAP gross profit margin to non-GAAP adjusted gross profit margin, (ii) amortization and depreciation for revenue generating activities to total amortization and depreciation and (iii) platform support costs to total cost of revenue (exclusive of amortization and depreciation) for each of the periods presented:

 We define platform support costs as costs to operate our revenue generating platforms that do not directly correlate with volume of sales transactions procured through our digital marketplace. Such costs include employee costs, data costs, platform hosting costs and other overhead costs. 
 
 (2) 
 We define marketplace vendor costs as direct costs charged by our hauling and recycling partners for services procured through our digital marketplace. 

Adjusted EBITDA 

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and GAAP net loss is its most comparable GAAP measurement. We define adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude interest expense and income, income tax expense and benefit, amortization and depreciation, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt obligations, equity-based compensation, gain or loss on change in fair value of warrant liabilities, gain or loss on change in fair value of earn-out liabilities, gain or loss on change in fair value of derivatives, executive severance charges, gain or loss on settlement of the management rollover bonuses, gain or loss on service fee settlements in connection with the Mergers, other non-operating income and expenses, and unique non-recurring income and expenses. 

54 

We have included adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results because it allows for more consistent comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding gains and losses that are non-operational in nature or outside the control of management, as well as items that may differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. It is also often used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating and comparing our results to other companies within our industry. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. 

Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of net loss or our other results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 

adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; 

adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; 

although amortization and depreciation are non-cash charges, the assets being amortized and depreciated will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 

adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items for which we may make adjustments in historical periods; and 

other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows in the short- and long-term to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service, acquisitions and investments, and other commitments and contractual obligations. We consider liquidity in terms of cash flows from operations and other sources, and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities. 

Our principal sources of liquidity have been borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of equity and warrant exercises and cash generated by operating activities. Our primary cash needs are for day-to-day operations, to fund working capital requirements, to fund our growth strategy, and to service our debt obligations. 

Our principal uses of cash in recent periods have been funding operations and servicing debts. Our long-term future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including revenue growth rate, achieving higher profitability on our revenue contracts, the timing and the amount of cash received from customers, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support investments, including research and development efforts and the continuing market adoption of our products. 

In each fiscal year since the Company s inception, we have incurred losses from operations and generated negative cash flows from operating activities. We also have negative working capital and stockholders deficit as of September 30, 2024. Our total current liabilities as of September 30, 2024, were 283.4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have net income attributable to the gain from the sale of the SaaS business which occurred in May 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 1.3 million, accounts receivable totaled 84.4 million and unbilled accounts receivable totaled 57.5 million. Availability under our June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility, which provided the ability to borrow up to 90.0 million, was 0. The September 2023 Rodina Letter of Credit provides an additional 15.0 million borrowing base collateral under the facility. Our outstanding indebtedness includes the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility, the June 2023 Term Loan, the Subordinated Term Loan and the convertible debentures, under which the principal of 73.5 million, 44.6 million, 21.3 million and 21.2 million, respectively, were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Pursuant to the Cantor Sales Agreement, we may offer and sell up to 50.0 million of shares of Class A Common Stock through Cantor. However, it is uncertain how quickly Cantor will be able to sell such shares of Class A Common Stock at the price that we request to deliver additional liquidity to the Company. 

We currently project that we will not have sufficient cash on hand or available liquidity under existing arrangements to meet our projected liquidity needs for the next 12 months. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

To address liquidity needs, we have executed various initiatives to modify our operations to reduce spending and improve cash flow. Initiatives we have undertaken in recent periods include (i) increased focus on operational efficiencies and cost reduction measures, (ii) eliminating redundancies that have been the byproduct of our recent growth and expansion, (iii) evaluating our portfolio and less profitable accounts to better ensure we are deploying resources efficiently, and (iv) exercising strict capital discipline for future investments, such as requiring investments to meet minimum hurdle rates. Additionally, on May 7, 2024, we have completed the sale of certain assets and entered into the Rodina SPA which provided the Company with additional cash, a portion of which were used to make partial payments to the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility and the June 2023 Term Loan. 

The Company is currently exploring refinancing options, which are not yet finalized. We believe that additional capital will be needed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet the Company s known liquidity needs for the next 12 months given that the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility is scheduled to mature and the borrowings under the facility will become due and payable on the maturity date. However, while we believe the Company will be able to obtain additional capital through debt and equity financing, including sales of Class A Common Stock under the Cantor Sales Agreement, to the extent necessary, we have obtained no firm commitment from current or prospective investors to date and no assurance can be provided that such additional financing will be obtained at the level acceptable to the Company within the necessary timeframe, if at all. Failure to secure sufficient additional funding in a timely manner or at all will impact our liquidity, including its ability to service its debt and other liabilities, and may require us to modify, delay, or abandon some of our planned future expansion or development, or to otherwise enact additional operating cost reductions available to management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and could force us to limit its business activities or discontinue its operations entirely. 

56 

If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, including under the Cantor Sales Agreement, dilution to stockholders will occur and may be substantial. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of common stockholders. The terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations and increase the cost of capital due to interest payment requirements. The capital markets have been very difficult and expensive to access in recent periods, which could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing. It is possible that we will not enter into all of financing contemplated and that no additional funding will be available at all in the capital markets. In addition, recent and any future increases in federal fund rates set by the Federal Reserve, which serve as a benchmark for rates on borrowing, will impact the cost and availability of debt financing. 

See Contractual Obligations below for a discussion of other obligations with respect to which we will be required to make significant future payments or under which we have significant financial contractual obligations.

Net cash used in operating activities for continuing operations decreased by 14 million to 53.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 67.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was driven by: 

an 9.0 million increase in non-cash gains and losses, primarily attributable to a 11.1 million net increase from gain/loss on change in fair value of warrants, 7.5 million net increase from gain/loss on change in fair value of derivatives and a 11.7 million favorable decrease in equity based compensation, partially offset by 5.3 million net decrease in gain on change in fair value of earn-out liabilities, 26.8 million decrease in settlement of accrued incentive compensation, a 7.0 million net decrease in gain on service fee settlement in connection with the Mergers, and a 0.2 million decrease in depreciation; 

a 10.7 million favorable increase attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily driven by a decrease in account receivable by 22.4 million, an increase in contract assets by 32.5 million, and by a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 0.6 million, partially offset by an unfavorable increase in prepaid expenses by 6.2 million, an accrued expenses increase by 34.7 million, contract liabilities increase by 0.1 million, and accounts payable increase by 41 million; and 

a 5.7 million decrease due to change from a 56.0 million net loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 61.7 million net loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Net cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations decreased by 3.0 million to a negative 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a positive 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was because the Company s cash flows only included the activities from April 1, 2024, through May 7, 2024, of the discontinued operations before it was disposed in May 2024. 

Cash flows provided by or used in investing activities 

Net cash used in investing activities for continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, remained relatively unchanged compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations increased by 62.6 million to 62.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in investing activities from discontinued operations of 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the 62.0 million of cash proceeds from sale of the SaaS business for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with no similar activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cash flows from financing activities 

Net cash used in financing activities was 23.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and net cash provided by financing activities was 70.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in financing activities, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted from the proceeds from issuance of Series A preferred stock for 20.0 million and 2.3 million of borrowings on the line of credit, and offset by 45.2 million of debt repayment on debt obligations and 0.4 million in equity issuance costs. Net cash provided by financing activities, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 include proceeds from long-term debt of 86.2 million, related party debt of 14.5 million, borrowing on the line of credit of 13.6 million and proceeds from issuance of common stock of 24.8 million, and offset by repayments of long term debt of 53.5 million, payment of financing costs of 13.9 million and RSU taxes of 1.1 million. 

Tax Receivable Agreement 

In connection with the consummation of the Mergers, Rubicon entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with the TRA Holders, whereby Rubicon is obligated to pay to the TRA Holders 85 of certain of Rubicon s realized (or in certain cases, deemed realized) tax savings as a result of certain tax benefits related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and future exchanges of Class B Units for Class A Common Stock or cash. Rubicon will benefit from the remaining 15 of such tax savings. 

The actual future payments to the TRA Holders will vary, and estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors and future events. The actual future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are dependent on a number of factors, including the price of Class A Common Stock at the time of the exchange; the timing of future exchanges; the extent to which exchanges are taxable; the amount and timing of the utilization of tax attributes; the amount, timing and character of our income; the U.S. federal, state and local tax rates then applicable; the depreciation and amortization periods that apply to the increases in tax basis; the timing and amount of any earlier payments that we may have made under the TRA; and the portion of our payments under the TRA that constitutes imputed interest or gives rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis. 

A significant portion of any potential future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement is anticipated to be payable over 15 years, consistent with the period over which the associated tax deductions would be realized by Rubicon, assuming Holdings LLC generates sufficient income to utilize the deductions. If sufficient income is not generated by Holdings LLC, the associated taxable income of Rubicon will be affected and the associated tax benefits to be realized will be limited, thereby similarly reducing the associated Tax Receivable Agreement payments to be made. We may however still need to seek additional sources of financing depending on the given circumstances at the time any payments will be made. 

58 

While many of the factors that will determine the amount of payments that Rubicon will make under the Tax Receivable Agreement are outside of its control, Rubicon expects that the payments it will make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. Rubicon generally expects to fund such distributions out of available cash of Holdings LLC, and as a result, such payments will reduce the cash provided by the tax savings generated from the relevant transactions that would otherwise have been available to Rubicon and Holdings LLC for other uses, including repayment of debt, funding day-to-day operations, reinvestment in the business or returning capital to holders of Class A Common Stock in the form of dividends or otherwise. 

Rubicon may incur significant costs in addition to the due course obligations arising under the Tax Receivable Agreement described above. In particular, in the event that (a) Rubicon undergoes certain change of control events (e.g., certain mergers, dispositions and other similar transactions), (b) there is a material uncured breach under the Tax Receivable Agreement, or (c) Rubicon elects to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, in each case, Rubicon s obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement would accelerate and become payable in a lump sum amount equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax savings calculated based on certain assumptions, as set forth in the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, the interest on the payments made pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement may significantly exceed Rubicon s other costs of capital. In certain situations, including upon the occurrence of the events described above, Rubicon could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that exceed its actual cash savings, requiring it to seek funding from other sources, including incurring additional debt. Thus, Rubicon s obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative effect on its financial condition and liquidity. 

Despite these potential costs, we do not believe that the Tax Receivable Agreement will be a material detriment to Rubicon s and Holdings LLC s future results of operations and liquidity, as any payments required under the Tax Receivable Agreement will arise directly from realized (or in certain cases, deemed realized) tax savings of Rubicon as a result of certain tax benefits related to the Mergers and future exchanges of Class B Units for Class A Common Stock or cash and are expected to be made in lieu of income taxes otherwise payable by Rubicon. Additionally, Rubicon will receive the benefit of 15 of any such tax savings. 

Debt 

On December 14, 2018, we entered into a 60.0 million Revolving Credit Facility secured by all assets of the Company including accounts receivable, intellectual property, and general intangibles. The Revolving Credit Facility s maturity was December 14, 2023 and bore an interest rate of SOFR plus 5.60 . On February 7, 2023, the we entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, which (i) increased the maximum borrowing amount to 75.0 million and (ii) amended the interest rate to between 4.8 up to SOFR plus 4.9 . On March 22, 2023, we entered into another amendment which included (i) a modification of the maturity date and (ii) a lender s consent to an amendment to the Subordinated Term Loan agreement. The borrowing under Revolving Credit Facility was fully paid and terminated on June 7, 2023. Concurrently, we entered into a 90.0 million June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility with a maturity date of the earlier of (i) June 7, 2026 or (ii) 90 days prior to the maturity date of the June 2023 Term Loan. The June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility bears an interest rate of SOFR plus 4.25 (9.7 as of September 30, 2024). The June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility later entered into two amendments on December 5, 2023, where the calculation methodology of the borrowing base collateral was modified, and on May 7, 2024, where (i) the lender consented to the SaaS Business sale and (ii) we agreed to make a partial prepayment of 11.4 million upon close of the sale of SaaS Business. On September 22, 2023, our borrowing base collateral under the facility increased by 15.0 million due to a standby letter of credit issued by an entity affiliated with Andres Chico and Jose Miguel Enrich with an expiration date of the September 30, 2024 and an automatic renewal option for one additional year through September 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, our total outstanding borrowings under the Line of Credit were 73.5 million and no amount remained available to draw, after accounting for all the changes discussed above. The June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility is subject to certain financial covenants. 

On March 29, 2019, we entered into a 20.0 million Term Loan agreement and subsequently upsized it to 60.0 million and bore an interest rate of LIBOR plus 9.5 with a maturity date of the earlier of March 29, 2024, or the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility, which was later extended to May 23, 2024 through an amendment on May 19, 2023. On November 18, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Term Loan agreement which incurred an additional 2.0 million fee, and beginning on April 3, 2023, an additional 0.15 million fee accrued to the principal balance of the Term Loan each week thereafter until the Term Loan was fully repaid. On February 7, 2023, we entered into another amendment, which (i) amended the interest rate to SOFR plus 9.6 and (ii) required us to make a prepayment of 10.3 million, which was paid on February 7, 2023, resulting a 0.8 million loss on extinguishments of debt obligations recorded on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. On June 7, 2023, we fully prepaid the borrowing under the Term Loan in the amount of 40.5 million and terminated the facility, resulting a 2.5 million of a loss on extinguishment of debt obligations on the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

59 

On December 22, 2021, we entered into a 20.0 million Subordinated Term Loan agreement which was originally scheduled to mature on December 22, 2022, bore an interest rate of 15.0 through the original maturity and 14.0 thereafter. Pursuant to the Subordinated Term Loan agreement, we entered into warrant agreements and issued common unit purchase warrants (the Subordinated Term Loan Warrants ). Pursuant to the Subordinated Term Loan agreement, we entered into warrant agreements and issued common unit purchase warrants (the Subordinated Term Loan Warrants ). On December 12, 2022, the Subordinated Term Loan Warrants were exercised and converted into Class A Common Stock. On December 30, 2022, we entered into an agreement with the lender of the Subordinated Term Loan, pursuant to which we agreed to compensate, in cash or shares of Class A Common Stock, the lender for the calculated amount between (a) the closing share price of Class A Common Stock on the business day immediately prior to the lender s exercise of the Subordinated Term Loan Warrants on December 12, 2022 multiplied by the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issued for such exercise (the December 2022 Warrant Shares and (b) the closing share price of Class A Common Stock on the business day immediately prior to the lender s sale of the December 2022 Warrant Shares multiplied by the number of the December 2022 Warrant Shares sold by the lender (the Subordinated Term Loan Warrants Make-Whole Agreement ), which expires on December 12, 2027. The maturity of the Subordinated Term Loan was subsequently extended to December 31, 2023, with the amendment entered into on November 18, 2022. On March 22, 2023, we entered into an amendment modifying its maturity date to March 29, 2024, which was subsequently amended to May 23, 2024, with an amendment entered into on May 19, 2023. On June 7, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Subordinated Term Loan agreement, which modified (a) its maturity to the earlier of (i) the scheduled maturity date of June 7, 2025, and (ii) the maturity date of the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility, and (b) the interest rate the Subordinated Term Loan bears to 15 . On May 7, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Subordinated Term Loan agreement, where the lender consented to the sale of the SaaS Business. Concurrently, we executed a side letter with the lender of the Subordinated Term Loan, which included additional non-financial covenants for certain time-based milestones in relation to potential transactions we may enter into in future periods. 

On June 7, 2023, we entered into a 75.0 million June 2023 Term Loan agreement with a maturity date of the earlier of (i) the scheduled maturity date of June 7, 2025, and (ii) the maturity date of the June 2023 Revolving Credit Facility. The June 2023 Term Loan bears an interest rate of the prime rate plus a margin of 8.75 or 8.25 with conditions. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable interest rate of the June 2023 Term Loan was 16.75 . At the time of any repayment of the June 2023 Term Loan, we are required to pay a fee in the amount of 12.0 of the principal repaid. On May 7, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the June 2023 Term Loan agreement, where (i) the lender consented to the sale of SaaS Business and (ii) the Company agreed to make a partial prepayment of 45.6 million upon close of the SaaS Business sale. On May 15, 2024, we executed a side letter with one of the three lenders of the June 2023 Term Loan, with additional non-financial covenants for certain time-based milestones in relation to potential transactions we may enter into in future periods, and interest rate (including cash interest and paid-in-kind interest) was capped at 14 . 

On February 1, 2023, we issued convertible debentures to certain third parties for a total principal amount of 1.4 million and a total net proceeds of 1.2 million (the Third Party Convertible Debentures with a maturity date of August 1, 2024, and accrue interest at the rate of 6.0 per annum. On June 2, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Third Party Convertible Debentures, with the exception of the three debentures, for which the amendment was executed on July 31, 2023. The amendment extended the maturity date to December 1, 2026. On February 1, 2023, we issued a convertible debenture to Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation (the NZ Superfund ), a then beneficial owner of greater than 10 of the issued and outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock, for a total principal amount of 5.1 million and the total net proceeds of 4.5 million (the NZ Superfund Convertible Debenture ).

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

For additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the disclosure included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as well as Note 1, Nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K and are not required to provide the information under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specific in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Per Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer certifying officers have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of September 30, 2024. Our certifying officers concluded that, as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to inherent limitations of internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Our
certifying officers concluded that the Company did not have an effective internal control over the review of the complex
transactions related to the equity and complex technical accounting matters related to warrants due to the lack of sufficient and
effective review processes. The material weakness resulted in a restatement of our financial statements as described in the
Explanatory Note to the amendment to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on May 20, 2024; and resulted in the
revision of our condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 in the
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) as of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
Furthermore, the control deficiencies described above have resulted in delays and untimeliness in our required financial statement
filings and created a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements would not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

64 

Remediation Status of Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We plan to enhance our processes by designing and implementing controls to review the equity transactions, including the completeness and accuracy of relevant information. We also plan to engage additional qualified resources and/or hire additional staff to ensure these incremental controls are properly implemented. 

Management continues to be actively engaged to take steps to remediate the material weakness, including enhanced processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our consolidated financial statements, providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents, and increased communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

65 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

In
the ordinary course of business, we are or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or purported class actions
related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities,
labor and employment, wage and hour and other claims. In management s opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected
to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. See Note 16 Commitments
