The net proceeds from the IPO Offerings amounted to million and million for the common stock and TEUs, respectively, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering-related expenses. The shares and TEUs began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on January 26, 2024 under the ticker symbols BTSG and BTSGU, respectively. BrightSpring Health Services, Inc. used a portion of the net proceeds received from the IPO Offerings to repay certain indebtedness (see Note 5). Additionally, a portion of the net proceeds will be used to pay termination fees in connection with the termination of our monitoring agreement with our controlling stockholders, KKR and WBA (the Monitoring Agreement (see Note 13). The remaining proceeds were retained for general corporate purposes. In connection with the IPO Offerings, the Company also granted equity awards to management and certain other full-time employees (see Note 15).

million , which consist of legal, accounting, filing, and other fees and costs directly attributable to the Company s IPO, were capitalized, and upon completion of the IPO in January 2024, were subsequently recorded in shareholders equity as a reduction of proceeds during the first fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2023, million of deferred offering costs were included in other assets in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. billion of funding was authorized to be distributed to health care providers through the Provider Relief Fund PRF in response to COVID-19.

The Company is in the process of reviewing the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We have estimated the fair value of acquired licenses and trade name based upon a third-party valuation. Based on the Company s preliminary valuations, the total estimated consideration of million has been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Consideration for the Haven Hospice acquisition, included a million cash payment, million seller note payable in 2028, and shares of the Company's common stock equal to million. The number of shares was calculated by dividing million by a price per share equal to the average of the volume weighted average trading price of the Company's common stock on each of the fifteen consecutive trading days ending on and including the trading day that is three trading days prior to the closing date, as required by the asset purchase agreement. The sellers are restricted from trading during a lock-up period from closing with agreed-upon sale volume limitations for four years thereafter. The asset purchase agreement also includes a post-closing adjustment feature to the extent any losses are incurred by the sellers in the sale of their common stock for four years following closing. See Note 9. The estimated intangible assets consist of million in indefinite-lived licenses and million of trade name. The trade name has an estimated average useful life of years. We expect all of the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes. The Company believes the resulting amount of goodwill reflects its expectation of synergistic benefits of the acquisition. Haven Hospice contributed million in revenue and million of operating income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Pro forma financial data for the Haven Hospice acquisition has not been included as the results of the operations are not material to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

The following discussion summarizes the debt agreements and related modifications for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. We were in compliance with all applicable financial debt covenants at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. First Lien Credit Agreement On , the Company entered into a First Lien Credit Agreement (the First Lien ), with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent. The First Lien originally consisted of a principal amount of million. In 2019, an additional delayed draw of million was made on the First Lien, resulting in a gross borrowing of million Tranche B-1 ). The First Lien, as amended in 2020, provided for the establishment of a Tranche B-2 Term Loan Tranche B-2 in an aggregate principal amount equal to million. The First Lien, as amended in 2021, provided for the establishment of a Tranche B-3 Term Loan Tranche B-3 in an aggregate principal amount equal to million. On February 21, 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds received from the IPO Offerings to repay million of the borrowings under the First Lien, and amended the First Lien to establish a new Tranche B-4 Term Loan Tranche B-4 in an aggregate principal amount of million. The proceeds from Tranche B-4 borrowings were used to refinance the equivalent

. Tranche B-4 has a maturity date of . The transaction was accounted for as a debt modification. Principal payments are due on the last business day of each quarter, which commenced in the second fiscal quarter of 2024 and equate to of the principal at issuance with a balloon payment due February 21, 2031. Revolving Credit Facility The First Lien also extended credit in the form of Revolving Credit Facility (the Revolver made available at any time and from time to time prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date (as defined in the First Lien). The Revolver comprises Revolving Credit Loans and Swingline Loans. The Swingline Lender may issue Swingline Loans at any time and from time to time prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, in an aggregated amount outstanding not in excess of million. Additionally, the Letter of Credit Issuer may issue standby Letters of Credit at any time, i n an aggregate stated amount outstanding not in excess of million (the LC Sublimit ), which reduces the Revolver borrowing capacity. In connection with the First Lien modification on February 21, 2024, borrowings of the Revolver bear interest at a rate equal to, SOFR (with a floor of plus for the Revolving Credit Loans or Alternate Base Rate ABR plus for the Swingline Loans. The modification also removed the springing maturity covenant of the Revolver. As such, the Revolver has a Revolving Credit M aturity Date of . The total borrowing capacity under the Revolver was million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million of borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and letters of credit, reducing the available borrowing capacity to approximately million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had million of borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and million of letters of credit reducing the available borrowing capacity to approximately million. The Company s First Lien also provides for additional letter of credit commitments (the LC Facility ), which are not subject to the LC Sublimit and do not reduce the Revolver borrowing capacity. On September 17, 2024, the Company amended the First Lien to increase the LC Facility from million to million. As of September 30, 2024, there were million of letters of credit outstanding under the LC Facility, resulting in an available borrowing capacity of million. As of December 31, 2023, there were million of letters of credit outstanding under the LC Facility, resulting in an available borrowing capacity of million. Second Lien Credit Agreement The Company s amended and restated Second Lien Credit Agreement (the Second Lien Facility ), with certain Lenders and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent consists of a principal amount of million. On January 30, 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds received from the IPO Offerings to repay all outstanding borrowings under the Second Lien Facility. No remaining obligation exists related to the Second Lien Facility. This transaction was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and the Company incur red a loss on extinguishment of debt of million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs during the first fiscal quarter of 2024. Derivative Financial Instruments To manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variable rates, the Company entered into three receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swap agreements, all effective September 30, 2022. Taken together with the related debt, these swaps create the economic equivalent of fixed-rate debt, up to the notional amount of the hedged debt. By using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we expose ourselves to credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes the Company, which creates credit risk for the Company. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, the Company owes the counterparty and, therefore, the Company is not exposed to the counterparty s credit risk in those circumstances. The Company mitigates counterparty credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. The derivative instruments entered into by the Company do not contain credit-risk-related contingent features. billion:

million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company expects approximately million of pre-tax gains to be reclassified out of AOCI into earnings within the next twelve months. The repayments on and modification of the First Lien borrowings and extinguishment of the Second Lien Facility in the first fiscal quarter of 2024 did not impact the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge arrangements outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 TEUs, which have a stated amount of per unit. Each TEU is comprised of a prepaid stock purchase contract Purchase Contract and a senior amortizing note Amortizing Note due , each issued by the Company. The Company will pay equal quarterly cash installments of per Amortizing Note on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1, commencing on May 1, 2024, except for the May 1, 2024 installment payment, which was per Amortizing Note, with a final installment payment date of . In the aggregate, the annual quarterly cash installments will be the equivalent of per year. Each installment payment constitutes a payment of interest and a partial repayment of principal. The Company paid million and million in TEU principal and interest payments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. E ach TEU may be separated by a holder into its constituent Purchase Contract and Amortizing Note, each of which is considered a freestanding financial instrument. The Amortizing Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all other existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and will rank senior to all of our existing and future indebtedness, if any, that is subordinated to the Amortizing Notes. At any time prior to the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding February 1, 2027, a holder may elect to settle its Purchase Contract early, in whole or in part, at an early settlement rate equal to the minimum settlement rate. The Company has the right to settle the Purchase Contracts on or after November 1, 2024, in whole but not in part, on a date fixed by it at an early mandatory settlement rate equal to the maximum settlement rate, subject to certain exceptions. The value allocated to the Purchase Contract is reflected net of issuance costs in additional paid-in capital. The value allocated to the Amortizing Notes is reflected in long-term debt in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, with payments expected in the next twelve months reflected in current portion of long-term debt. Issuance costs related to the Amortizing Notes are reflected as a reduction of the carrying amount and will be amortized through the maturity date using the effective interest rate method.

Discrete items recognized 

() 

() 

Effective tax rate recognized in the statements of operations 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal income tax rate, primarily as a result of the year-to-date cumulative adjustment of effective tax rate on near break-even pre-tax book income for the quarter. During the third fiscal quarter of 2024, the Company has utilized the actual effective tax rate for the year as the best estimate of the annual effective tax rate. The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal income tax rate, primarily as a result of tax expense related to the Silver matter, which was not expected to be deductible for tax purposes at that time. It was determined to be partially deductible upon finalization of the agreement in 2024. See Note 10 for further discussion of the Silver matter. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal income tax rate, primarily as a result of limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation that now apply to the Company upon completion of its IPO in January 2024. In addition, the discrete tax benefit related to the Silver matter increased the effective tax rate on pre-tax book losses to date. The Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal income tax rate, primarily as a result of the unfavorable impact of the Silver matter as a percentage of estimated annual pre-tax book loss, which was not expected to be deductible for tax purposes at that time. It was determined to be partially deductible upon finalization of the agreement in 2024. See Note 10 for further discussion of the Silver matter.

The fair values of our interest rate swaps are based upon Level 2 inputs, which include valuation models. The key inputs for the valuation models are quoted market prices, interest rates, forward yield curves, and credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or us. For disclosures about the fair value measurements of our derivative instruments, refer to Note 5. The contingent consideration represents future earn-outs and a post-closing equity adjustment feature, both associated with acquisitions, which are recognized as a component of the purchase price at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. These liabilities are classified as accrued expenses and long-term liabilities in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of the liabilities associated with future earn outs were derived using the income approach with unobservable inputs, including future earnings forecasts and present value assumptions, and there was little or no market data (Level 3). The Company will re-assess the fair values on each reporting period thereafter until settlement. The preliminary fair value of the liability associated with post-closing equity adjustment feature related to the Haven Hospice acquisition was derived with unobservable inputs using a Monte Carlo simulation, where the common stock price of the Company was evolved using a Geometric Brownian Motion of a period from the valuation date to the end of the fourth anniversary of closing. Estimated equity volatility was based on historical volatility, implied volatility, and peer group volatility over various periods. The Company will re-assess the fair value at each reporting period with changes in value being recorded through the statement of operations. The ultimate settlement of the liability will be through either issuance of additional equity shares and/or additional cash paid in case of net realized losses; or reduction of the outstanding balance of the seller note, in the case of net aggregate gain on sales.

Each of these options is to be triggered upon the occurrence of specified events and/or upon the passage of time. The Company calculates the redemption amount related to the Abode Care Partners options using a Monte Carlo simulation and records the amount, if any, by which the redemption amount exceeds the carrying value as a charge to accumulated deficit. The total redeemable noncontrolling interest associated with Abode Care Partners was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (our Form 10-Q ). This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements. When reviewing the discussion below, you should keep in mind the substantial risks and uncertainties that characterize our business. Known material factors that could affect our financial performance and actual results, and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements included in this discussion or otherwise made by our management, are described in Item 2 of Part I of this Form 10-Q, and in Item 1A, Risk Factors of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our Form 10-K ). Factors that could cause or contribute to such difference are not limited to those identified in Risk Factors. When used in the following discussion, Senior patients and populations mean individuals who are aged 65 and older, Specialty patients and populations mean individuals who have unique, specialized and most often chronic/life-long health conditions and needs, and Behavioral patients and populations mean individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities including mental illness. Overview We are a leading home and community-based healthcare services platform, focused on delivering complementary pharmacy and provider services to complex patients.

See Note 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Form 10-Q for more information regarding revenue by payor type for each reportable segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Trends and Other Factors Affecting Business Continued Growth of our Pharmacy Solutions Patient Populations We focus on providing health-dependent medications in a timely and well-supported manner to our patients receiving pharmacy solutions in their home and community-based settings. Our pharmacy services are primarily delivered directly to patients in their place of residence, home, or stay, and sometimes in a clinic setting. According to industry reports, pharmacy solutions delivered to and tailored for the home environment, such as home infusion services, oncology services, and daily medication management services in the home, will continue to grow faster than the overall and general pharmacy market. We have continued to expand our pharmacy capabilities to serve this need. Overall, our pharmacy has grown patient census and prescriptions by approximately 12 and 15 , respectively, in the third fiscal quarter of 2024 compared to the third fiscal quarter of 2023. We are a leading independent pharmacy provider in our respective pharmacy patient markets, and we expect to continue to increase our share, including home infusion patients, specialty oncology patients, behavioral patients, in-home Seniors, and hospice patients. Continued Growth of our Provider Services Patient Populations We focus on delivering high-touch and coordinated services to medically complex Senior and Specialty patients in the home and community-based settings where they live. As the baby boomer population ages, Seniors, who comprise a significant majority of our patients, will represent a higher percentage of the overall population. Given the proven value proposition of home-based health services, we believe patients will increasingly seek treatment and referral sources and payors will increasingly support treatment in homes more often than in higher cost, less convenient, higher acuity institutional settings. The vast majority of patients we serve in our provider businesses are served in the home, and we have purposefully continued to expand our service offering and footprint to serve patients in this lower cost setting. Over the past five years we built upon supportive care services to patients, as we have meaningfully expanded our footprint of highly clinical and expert services to home health, rehabilitation, and hospice patients to address a large national healthcare need and more completely and better serve Senior and Specialty patients in the home as evidenced by continued census growth within the Provider Services segment. Our complementary services that address the multiple needs of these patient populations will increasingly provide integrated care opportunities to provide more complete and better coordinated services to patients across health settings and stages. Stable Reimbursement Environment Across our Portfolio of Businesses Our revenue is dependent upon our contracts and relationships with payors for our must-serve patient populations. We partner with a large and diverse set of payor groups nationally and in each of our markets, to form provider networks and to lower the overall cost of care. We structure our payor contracts to help both providers and payors achieve their objectives in a mutually aligned manner. Maintaining, supporting, and both deepening and increasing the number of these contracts and relationships, particularly as we continue to grow market share and enter new markets, is important for our long-term success. We have observed relatively stable reimbursement rates from government and commercial payors in our pharmacy and provider services over a number of years, particularly for services provided to high-need, medically complex populations. Due to the medical necessity of our services, which are lower cost than healthcare services provided in other settings and reduce ER, hospital and institutional facility utilization, we have a history of reimbursement stability. Culture of Quality and Compliance and Consistent Operations Execution Quality and compliance are central to our strategies and mission. We have demonstrated leading and excellent service and customer/patient/family satisfaction scores across the organization, as referenced in prior filings such as our Form 10-K. In addition to quality and compliance resources and programs in field operations, we invest in people, training, auditing, signature programs, 

 28 

accreditations, advocacy, and technologies to support quality, compliance, and safety as part of our Quality First framework. We have demonstrated consistently high and often leading marks for service levels, satisfaction scores, and quality metrics in our industries. Operational excellence is also an ongoing focus at the Company, including how we collect and share key metrics, hold operational reviews, audit, conduct training, deploy expert support resources, execute on corrective and preventative actions, and implement continuous improvement initiatives across the organization. We have continued to make investments in automation, data, and technology systems to support enhanced workflows, further scale, and future growth across service lines. Ability to Build De Novo Locations We have a proven ability to augment growth of existing operations by expanding our presence and opening new locations in both of our reportable segments, Pharmacy Solutions and Provider Services across geographies with consistent ramp-up in performance after site opening. We believe our platform can continue to build further scale nationally, adding density to additional and targeted key markets as a lever to facilitate maximum pharmacy and provider services overlap, integrated and value-based care, and growth. The Company s geographic and operations scale, and platform of complementary segments and service lines, provides us with access to more de novo opportunities to consider and prioritize. We typically identify and open new locations within proximity of an existing location as we leverage existing market knowledge and presence to expand in target markets, regions, and states. Our internal support resources in real estate, purchasing, IT, credentialing, payor contracting, HR, and sales and marketing, along with our Project Management Office, help to support and manage de novo locations from start to opening. We expect to continue to selectively and strategically expand our footprint within the United States and extend our service offerings to our patients and for customers, referral sources, and payors. We believe de novo investments facilitate more integrated care capability and are a meaningful organic growth driver for the Company. Ability to Facilitate Integrated Care Our operating model consists of complementary pharmacy and provider services that high-need Senior and Specialty populations require, and it is designed to increasingly coordinate, manage, and serve patients across our various needs and settings over time, leading to improved patient, family, physician, and referral source satisfaction, improved payor experiences, and better outcomes. Our performance and potential to drive increased service volume for increased patient and health outcomes impact is driven partly by our appeal with our patients, families, customers, referral sources, and payors to provide multiple integrated care services either in the same setting at the same time or across settings and stages of health within our collection of pharmacy solutions and provider services and differentiated overall capabilities. We provide multiple pharmacy and provider services to approximately 20,000 patients today, and we believe that there are substantially more opportunities to deliver more integrated care, given the hundreds of thousands of patients we serve and a similar number of patients discharging from customers annually. Value-add, beneficial, and multiple integrated care opportunities exist for our customer base and all Senior and Specialty patient populations not only across pharmacy and provider services, but also within each segment. Within pharmacy services, CCRx is aimed at providing medication risk and therapy management continuously and longitudinally post discharge from hospitals and skilled nursing customers. Within the provider services, patients often transition from home health to hospice services and can receive therapy and supportive care services concurrent with each other and with home health and hospice. Aligning to Value-Based Care Reimbursement Models with Innovative Solutions The scale and depth of our complimentary platform of diverse yet related customer and patient services that complex patients require positions us at the forefront with governmental and commercial payors who are increasingly seeking ways to expand value-based reimbursement models. Our high-quality services that are delivered in home and community-based and patient and family-preferred settings at lower comparable costs are well-positioned for the long-term, and we continue to add wraparound care management capabilities and offerings to our core services. In addition to our large Medicare and Medicaid beneficiary populations, we have a large number of non-governmental payor contracts across the organization today, which both diversifies our payor mix, and provides for additional value-based opportunities and partnerships. The Company s focused build out of its (i) Home-Based Primary Care, transitional care programs, and in-home medication therapy management, and (ii) Clinical (Nursing) Hub, are key enablers to coordinate base pharmacy and provider services and drive improved quality and lower costs for value-based care constructs. In addition to numerous payor contracts that feature reimbursement incentives, in the past year the Company has entered into several accountable care organization ACO arrangements to participate in shared savings from its attributed primary care patients and other ACO partnerships and contract as a preferred provider. Initial Public Offering On January 30, 2024, we completed our initial public offering IPO of 53,333,334 shares of common stock at a price of 13.00 per share and a concurrent offering of 8,000,000 6.75 tangible equity units TEUs with a stated amount of 50.00 per unit (collectively, the IPO Offerings ). The net proceeds from the IPO Offerings amounted to 656.5 million and 389.0 million for the 

 29 

common stock and TEUs, respectively, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering-related expenses. The shares of common stock and TEUs began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on January 26, 2024 under the ticker symbols BTSG and BTSGU, respectively. We used the proceeds received from the IPO Offerings (i) to repay all indebtedness outstanding under the Second Lien Facility, (ii) to repay all indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, (iii) to repay 343.3 million outstanding aggregate amount under the First Lien Facility, and (iv) to pay certain expenses in the offering. We have used and intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes. Additionally, we will pay 22.7 million of termination fees in connection with the termination of our monitoring agreement with our controlling stockholders, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Co. L.P. KKR and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (together with KKR, the Managers (the Monitoring Agreement ). The Company will pay these fees during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024. New Equity Awards We granted approximately 63.3 million in non-cash share-based compensation with respect to equity awards to our management and certain other full-time employees in January 2024 at the time of the IPO Offerings. Additionally, as previously disclosed in connection with the IPO, we granted approximately 100.0 million in non-cash share-based compensation with respect to equity awards, which equates to approximately 7.7 million restricted stock units, to certain full-time employees in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Comparability Quality Incentive Payment As discussed under Part I, Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company was eligible to receive incentive payments in connection with a payor contract based on the Company's Net Promoter Score NPS achieved from surveys performed directly by the payor. During the second fiscal quarter of 2023, our Infusion and Specialty Pharmacy services earned a quality incentive payment QIP of approximately 30 million. The Company did not receive a QIP during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The QIP program has reached its conclusion. Legal Costs and Settlements Accrual In November 2023, the Company agreed to settle the Silver matter without admitting liability, as discussed under Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. On May 29, 2024, the parties entered into a final settlement agreement, which was approved by both the United States Department of Justice and the District Court. The total financial impact of the settlement is 120.0 million. The District Court entered an order dismissing the Silver action in its entirety, with prejudice, on July 3, 2024. See Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies within the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Update on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic On May 11, 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services declared the COVID-19 pandemic is no longer a public health emergency. New variants could affect our operations for an extended period; however, at this time we cannot confidently forecast the duration or the ultimate financial impact on our operations, should such an impact occur. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received no funds from the Provider Relief Fund PRF and recognized no income related to the program. The Company received and recognized into income 18.8 million from the PRF for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income recognized was offset directly by the expenses incurred within selling, general, and administrative expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations, which resulted in no net financial impact to the Company. Components of Results of Operations Revenues . The Company recognizes the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. For transactions involving the transfer of goods, revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the products sold, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement. For transactions exclusively involving provision of services, revenues are recognized over time based on an appropriate measure of progress. Cost of Goods and Cost of Services . We classify expenses directly related to providing goods and services, including depreciation and amortization, as cost of goods and cost of services. Direct costs and expenses principally include cost of drugs, net of 

 30 

rebates, salaries and benefits for direct care and service professionals, contracted labor costs, insurance costs, transportation costs for clients requiring services, certain client expenses such as food, supplies and medicine, residential occupancy expenses, which primarily comprise rent and utilities, and other miscellaneous direct goods or service-related expenses. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist of expenses incurred in support of our operations and administrative functions and include labor costs, such as salaries, bonuses, commissions, benefits, and travel-related expenses, distribution expenses, facilities rental costs, third-party revenue cycle management costs, and corporate support costs including finance, information technology, legal costs and settlements, human resources, procurement, and other administrative costs. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt reflects the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs upon the early repayment of our Second Lien Facility. Interest Expense, net . Interest expense, net includes the debt service costs associated with our various debt instruments, including our First Lien Facilities and Second Lien Facility, and the amortization of related deferred financing fees, which are amortized over the term of the respective credit agreement. Interest expense, net also includes the portion of the gain or loss on our interest rate swap agreements that is reclassified into earnings. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) . Our provision for income taxes is based on permanent book/tax differences and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant estimates and judgments are required in determining the provision for income taxes.

The following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the foregoing table summarizing our consolidated results of operations. Revenues Revenues were 2,906.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 2,256.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 650.3 million or 28.8 . The increase resulted from growth in our Pharmacy Solutions and Provider Services segments. See additional discussion in Segment Results of Operations below. 

 31 

Cost of Goods Cost of goods was 2,077.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 1,509.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 567.3 million or 37.6 . The increase resulted from an increase in Pharmacy Solutions cost of goods. See additional discussion in Segment Results of Operations below. Cost of Services Cost of services was 421.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 388.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 33.2 million or 8.5 . The increase resulted from an increase in Provider Services cost of services. See additional discussion in Segment Results of Operations below. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 351.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 410.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 59.3 million or 14.4 . The decrease primarily resulted from the following segment activity and factors: an increase of 22.4 million, or 5.5 growth on consolidated 2023 selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a result of growth in our Pharmacy Solutions and Provider Services segments. See additional discussion in Segment Results of Operations below; 

 an increase of 14.4 million, or 3.5 growth on consolidated 2023 selling, general, and administrative expenses, due to non-cash share-based compensation related to the new equity awards granted to management and certain full-time employees in conjunction with the IPO; 

 an increase of 12.0 million, or 2.9 growth on consolidated 2023 selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a result of an increase in other operational expenses year-over-year; offset by, 

 a decrease of 108.1 million, or 26.3 , decline on consolidated 2023 selling, general, and administrative expenses, due to the settlement and changes in estimate of legal settlements and defense costs related to certain historical PharMerica litigation matters, which includes the Silver matter. See Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies within the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. 

 Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net was 56.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 83.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 27.6 million or 33.0 . The decrease primarily resulted from lower outstanding term debt as compared to the prior period and a 0.6 million increase in interest income related to cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, from 9.2 million of interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Income tax expense was 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an income tax benefit of 5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 15.6 million. The increase in the income tax expense is attributable to an increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 1,252.9 compared to 4.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of the year-to-date cumulative adjustment of the third fiscal quarter of 2024 estimated effective tax rate on near break-even pre-tax book income for the quarter. Net Loss Net loss was 9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 130.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 121.1 million. The decrease in the net loss is primarily attributable to the aforementioned decrease in interest expense, net and legal settlement and defense costs.

Adjusted EBITDA (1) Adjusted EBITDA was 151.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 130.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 20.5 million or 15.7 . The increase primarily resulted from the following segment activity and factors: an increase of 24.8 million, or 19.0 growth on consolidated 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, as a result of growth in our Pharmacy Solutions and Provider Services segments. See additional discussion in Segment Results of Operations below; offset by 

 a decrease of 4.3 million, or 3.3 decline on consolidated 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, as a result of increases in certain public company costs incurred, investments in information technology, and positions to support growth within the business.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 1,039.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 986.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 53.1 million or 5.4 . The increase primarily resulted from the following segment activity and factors: an increase of 46.8 million, or 4.7 growth on consolidated 2023 selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a result of growth in our Pharmacy Solutions and Provider Services segments. See additional discussion in Segment Results of Operations below; 

 an increase of 43.7 million, or 4.5 growth on consolidated 2023 selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a result of our IPO Offerings and are therefore not expected to reoccur. These expenses include 22.7 million of termination fees we will pay to the Managers in connection with the termination of our Monitoring Agreement; 15.0 million of previously unrecognized non-cash share-based compensation expense related to performance-vesting options, a portion of which vested upon the IPO; and 6.0 million of non-capitalizable offering costs; 

 an increase of 35.8 million, or 3.6 growth on consolidated 2023 selling, general, and administrative expenses, due to non-cash share-based compensation related to the new equity awards granted to management and certain full-time employees in conjunction with the IPO; 

 an increase of 26.6 million, or 2.7 growth on consolidated 2023 selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a result of an increase in other operational expenses year-over-year; offset by, 

 a decrease of 99.8 million, or 10.1 , decline on consolidated 2023 selling, general, and administrative expenses, due to the settlement and changes in estimate of legal settlements and defense costs related to certain historical PharMerica litigation matters, which includes the Silver matter. See Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies within the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. 

 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used proceeds from the IPO Offerings to repay the Second Lien on January 30, 2024 and, as a result, incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of 12.7 million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. There was no loss on extinguishment of debt recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net was 173.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 241.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 68.0 million or 28.2 . The decrease primarily resulted from lower outstanding term debt as compared to the prior period and a 7.0 million increase in interest income related to cash flow hedges of interest rate risk from 21.9 million of interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 28.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company's outstanding term debt decreased in the first fiscal quarter of 2024 due to the paydowns on our term debt using proceeds from the IPO Offerings. Income Tax Benefit Income tax benefit was 23.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 10.0 million. The increase in the income tax benefit is attributable to an increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 39.0 compared to 8.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation that now apply to the Company upon completion of its IPO in January 2024, as well as the discrete tax benefit recognized in the period related to the Silver matter that was finalized during the second fiscal quarter of 2024. During 2023, the Company's effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal income tax rate, primarily as a result of the unfavorable impact of the Silver legal settlement, which was not expected to be deductible for tax purposes at that time. See Note 10 within the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the matter. Net Loss Net loss was 35.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 149.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 113.7 million. Net loss for 2024 includes the aforementioned 43.7 million of expense related to non-recurring costs directly associated with the IPO Offerings. Additionally, the Company incurred a write-off of 12.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs upon the extinguishment of the Second Lien and 43.5 million of non-cash share-based compensation expense related to new equity awards granted to management and certain full-time employees in connection with the IPO Offerings. The increase in expenses is offset by the aforementioned decrease in interest expense, net and legal settlement and 

 34 

defense costs, increase in revenues, and increase in income tax benefit. When excluding the approximately 30 million QIP received in 2023, net loss decreased by 143.9 million compared to a net loss of 179.8 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA (1) Adjusted EBITDA was 420.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 395.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 25.4 million or 6.4 . When excluding the approximately 30 million QIP received in 2023, Adjusted EBITDA increased 55.7 million or 15.3 . The increase of 25.4 million primarily resulted from the following segment activity and factors: an increase of 40.0 million, or 10.1 growth on consolidated 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, as a result of growth in our Provider Services segments. See additional discussion in Segment Results of Operations below; offset by, 

 an increase of 3.6 million, or 0.9 growth on consolidated 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, as a result of a growth in our Pharmacy Solutions segment. See additional discussion in Segment Results of Operations below; and, 

 o When excluding the approximately 30 million QIP received in 2023, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA related to the Pharmacy Solutions segment increased 9.3 compared to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of 365.0 million in 2023. 

 a decrease of 18.2 million, or 4.6 decline on consolidated 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, as a result of increases in certain public company costs incurred, investments in information technology, and positions to support growth within the business.

The following discussion of our Pharmacy Solutions segment results of operations should be read in conjunction with the foregoing table summarizing our segment results of operations. Revenues Revenues were 2,265.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 1,673.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 592.5 million or 35.4 . The increase primarily resulted from volume growth in prescriptions dispensed across and within the Pharmacy Solutions segment. Revenues attributable to Infusion and Specialty Pharmacy were 1,678.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 1,180.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 498.1 million or 42.2 attributable to an increase in prescriptions dispensed on 

 35 

certain specialty branded drugs. Revenues attributable to Home and Community Pharmacy were 587.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 493.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 94.4 million or 19.1 attributable to volume growth. The increase in revenue per prescription dispensed is due to mix changes year-over-year and a greater relative increase in volume growth in certain specialty brand drugs, which carry a higher revenue per prescription dispensed. Cost of Goods Cost of goods was 2,077.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 1,509.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 567.3 million or 37.6 . The increase primarily resulted from the aforementioned revenue growth in the period as well as an increase in cost per prescription dispensed as a result of mix shift. Gross profit was 188.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 163.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 25.3 million or 15.5 . The increase primarily resulted from the aforementioned revenue growth in the period, primarily the result of outsized volume growth as well as mix in certain specialty branded drugs, which have lower margins. Gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.3 compared to 9.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin is due to mix shift in the Pharmacy Solutions segment with greater relative volume growth in Infusion and Specialty Pharmacy, along with product-level mix shifts, rate changes, and an increase in the fulfillment cost per script in Home and Community Pharmacy. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 117.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 106.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 10.7 million or 10.1 . The increase primarily resulted from the aforementioned revenue growth in the period with selling, general, and administrative expenses growing less than the volume growth rate and demonstrating economies of scale. Segment EBITDA Segment EBITDA was 99.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 86.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 13.1 million or 15.2 . The increase primarily resulted from the aforementioned revenue and gross profit growth in the period.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which we have discussed above, we also evaluate our financial performance using EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, such as net income (loss) and diluted EPS. Rather, we present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental measures of our performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS The following are key financial metrics and, when used in conjunction with U.S. GAAP measures, we believe they provide useful information for evaluating our core business performance, enable comparison of financial results across periods, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management for financial and operational decision-making. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before income tax benefit, interest expense, net, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS exclude certain other items that are either non-recurring, infrequent, non-cash, unusual, or items deemed by management to not be indicative of the performance of our core operations, including non-cash, share-based compensation; acquisition, integration, and transaction-related costs; restructuring and divestiture-related and other costs; goodwill impairment; legal costs associated with certain historical matters for PharMerica and settlement costs; significant projects; management fees; and unreimbursed COVID-19 related costs. In determining which adjustments are made to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS, management considers both (1) certain non-recurring, infrequent, non-cash, or unusual items, which can vary significantly from year to year, as well as (2) certain other items that may be recurring, frequent, or settled in cash but which management does not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. The financial measure calculated under U.S. GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss). The financial measure calculated under U.S. GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted EPS. We have historically incurred substantial acquisition, integration, and transaction-related costs. The underlying acquisition activities take place over a defined timeframe, have distinct project timelines, and are incremental to activities and costs that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Therefore, we have excluded these costs from our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS because it provides management a normalized view of our core, ongoing operations after integrating our acquired companies. The legal costs and settlements adjustment represents defense costs associated with certain PharMerica litigation matters, two of which are being finalized as of September 30, 2024, that commenced prior to KKR Stockholder s and Walgreen Stockholder s acquisition of PharMerica in December 2017, as well as settlement costs associated with these historical PharMerica cases including the Silver matter, which settled in November 2023. We have excluded defense costs associated with these PharMerica litigation matters from our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS due to the magnitude of these cases and the costs attributable to them, the timing of the commencement of the cases and the fact that no similar cases have been brought against the Company since the acquisition of PharMerica, and the fact that these cases are unlike our routine legal and regulatory proceedings that we see in the normal course of business. Further, we have excluded settlement costs associated with the Silver matter from our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS due to the magnitude of the case and the costs attributable to it, as well as the fact that the Silver matter is unlike our routine legal and regulatory proceedings that we see in the normal course of business. The significant projects adjustment represents costs associated with certain transformational projects, which are not considered to be a part of our normal and recurring business operations and are not expected to recur in our future business plans. Moreover, the costs associated with significant projects, which are incurred on an infrequent and limited basis, are not reflective of our operating performance. Due to the aforementioned reasons, we have excluded the costs related to significant projects from our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS, as such adjustment provides a more meaningful understanding to investors and others of our ongoing results. The management fees adjustment represents fees paid historically under the Monitoring Agreement related to either (i) activities that are expected to be performed by our existing personnel upon the termination of the Monitoring Agreement, and thus not expected to result in incremental costs subsequent to the IPO Offerings, or (ii) acquisitions, divestitures, and external financing activities, which costs would otherwise be excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS. Therefore, we have excluded management fees from our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS, as such fees are no longer applicable and representative of our ordinary operating performance as a result of the completion of the IPO Offerings. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS are not measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income (loss), diluted EPS or other financial measures performed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies financial measures and therefore may not be comparable to methods used by other companies. Given our determination of adjustments in arriving at our computations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS, these non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes or

alternatives to net income or loss, operating income or loss, earnings or loss per diluted share, cash flows from operating activities, total indebtedness, or any other financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of cash have historically been from operating activities. Our principal source of liquidity in excess of cash from operating activities has historically been from proceeds from our debt facilities and issuances of common stock. Our principal uses of cash and liquidity have historically been for acquisitions, debt service requirements, and financing of working capital. We believe that our operating cash flows, available cash on hand, and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility and the LC Facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months and beyond. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict, including the size, timing, and structure of any future acquisitions, future capital investments, and future results of operations. We cannot assure you that cash provided by operating activities or cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, we may have to obtain additional financing. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all. We evaluate our liquidity based upon the availability we have under our First Lien Facilities in addition to the net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities. Specifically, we review the activity under the Revolving Credit Facility and the LC Facility and consider period end balances outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the LC Facility. Based upon the outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility and the LC Facility, we calculate the availability for incremental borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the LC Facility. Such amount, in addition to cash on our balance sheet, is what we consider to be our Total Liquidity.

Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 66.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 48.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to the following: an increase of 114.0 million in cash outflows for the payments of legal settlements including the Silver matter in 2024; 

 an increase of 30.0 million in cash outflows for direct and indirect remuneration fees paid; 

 a decrease of approximately 30 million of cash inflows related to the QIP received in 2023 that was not received in 2024; 

 a decrease of 18.8 million of cash inflows for the PRF general distribution which was received in 2023, as compared to no PRF general distribution in 2024; 

 a decrease of 61.0 million in cash outflows for interest, net primarily as a result of paydowns, extinguishments and modifications of debt utilizing proceeds from the IPO Offerings; and 

 a decrease of 11.3 million in cash outflows for income taxes. 

 Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased by 7.1 million, from 117.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 124.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to a 8.9 million increase in purchases of property and equipment in 2024 compared to 2023 and a decrease of 2.7 million cash paid for acquisitions in 2024 compared to 2023. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 214.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to net proceeds received from the IPO Offerings of 1,045.5 million, net borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility of 

 43 

46.4 million, partially offset by extinguishment of and repayments on our long-term debt of 818.6 million, payment of debt issuance costs of 43.2 million, and other financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was 67.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to net borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility of 98.3 million, partially offset by repayments on our long-term debt of 22.9 million, payment of finance leases obligations of 8.6 million, and other financing activities. Debt We typically incur debt to finance mergers and acquisitions, and we borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility for working capital purposes, as well as to finance acquisitions, as needed. Below is a summary of our long-term indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. First Lien Credit Agreement On March 5, 2019, the Company entered into the First Lien Credit Agreement, among Phoenix Intermediate Holdings Inc., as Holdings, Phoenix Guarantor Inc., as the Borrower, the several lenders from time to time parties thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent (the First Lien Credit Agreement ). The First Lien Credit Agreement originally consisted of a principal amount of 1,650.0 million. In 2019, an additional delayed draw of 150.0 million was made on the First Lien Credit Agreement Tranche B-1 ). The First Lien Credit Agreement was further amended in 2020 Tranche B-2 and 2021 Tranche B-3 to establish additional borrowings of 550.0 million and 675.0 million, respectively, resulting in a total gross borrowings of 3,025.0 million. On June 30, 2023, the Company amended the terms of the First Lien Credit Agreement to reflect a change in reference rate to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). On February 21, 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds received from the IPO Offerings to repay 343.3 million of the borrowings under the First Lien, and established Tranche B-4 to refinance the remaining 2,566.0 million of borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement at a rate equal to SOFR plus 3.25 . Tranche B-4 has a maturity date of February 21, 2031. For additional information about our First Lien Credit Agreement, see Note 5 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Revolving Credit Facility The total borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility (the Revolver was 475.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 97.1 million of borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and no letters of credit reducing the available borrowing capacity to approximately 377.9 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 50.7 million of borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and 6.6 million of letters of credit, reducing the available borrowing capacity to 417.7 million. The First Lien Credit Agreement, as amended on September 17, 2024, provides for an additional 65.0 million of letter of credit commitments, or the LC Facility, which are not subject to the LC Sublimit. As of September 30, 2024, there were 62.0 million of letters of credit outstanding under the LC Facility, resulting in an available borrowing capacity of 3.0 million. As of December 31, 2023, the LC Facility provided for an additional 55.0 million of letter of credit commitments, and there were 54.3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the LC Facility, resulting in an available borrowing capacity of 0.7 million. For additional information about our Revolving Credit Facility and LC Facility, see Note 5 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Second Lien Credit Agreement On March 5, 2019, the Company entered into a 450.0 million Second Lien Facility. Borrowings under the Second Lien Facility were subordinated to the First Lien Credit Agreement. On January 30, 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds received from the IPO Offerings to repay all outstanding borrowings under the Second Lien Facility. No further obligation exists related to the Second Lien Facility. This transaction was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and the Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of 12.7 million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. The First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement described above contain customary negative covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the Company and its restricted subsidiaries ability to merge and consolidate with other companies, incur indebtedness, grant liens or security interests on assets, make acquisitions, loans, advances, or investments, pay dividends, sell or otherwise transfer assets, prepay or modify terms of certain junior indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates, or change their lines of business or fiscal year. In addition, under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company will not permit 

 44 

the consolidated first lien secured debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) ratio to be greater than 6.90 to 1.00, which shall be tested as of the end of the most recent quarter at any time when the aggregate revolving credit loans exceed 35 of the total revolving credit commitments. Interest Rate Swap Agreements To manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variable rates, the Company entered into three receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swap agreements, with a combined notional value of 2.0 billion, all effective September 30, 2022 with a maturity date of September 30, 2025. The refinancing of existing term debt on February 21, 2024 did not result in a change to the terms of the interest rate swap agreements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, interest expense, net includes interest income related to cash flow hedges of interest rate risk of 28.9 million and 31.4 million, respectively. Tangible Equity Units Concurrently with the IPO, we issued 8,000,000 TEUs, which have a stated amount of 50.00 per unit. Each TEU is comprised of a prepaid stock purchase contract Purchase Contract and a senior amortizing note Amortizing Note due February 1, 2027, each issued by the Company. The Company will pay equal quarterly cash installments of 0.8438 per Amortizing Note on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1, commencing on May 1, 2024, except for the May 1, 2024 installment payment, which was 0.8531 per Amortizing Note, with a final installment payment date of February 1, 2027. In the aggregate, the annual quarterly cash installments will be equivalent of 6.75 per year. Each installment payment constitutes a payment of interest and a partial repayment of principal. Each TEU may be separated by a holder into its constituent Purchase Contract and Amortizing Note. Refer to Note 6 within our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates In preparing our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we must use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are hereby incorporated by reference. Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Impact of Inflation Wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace. The impact of inflation on the Company is primarily in the area of labor costs. The healthcare industry is labor intensive. There can be no guarantee we will not experience increases in the cost of labor, particularly given the shortage of qualified caregivers in our markets, and the demand for homecare services is expected to grow. In addition, increases in healthcare costs are typically higher than inflation and impact our costs under our employee benefit plans. Managing these costs remains a significant challenge and priority for us. While we believe the effects of inflation, if any, and labor shortages on our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant, there can be no guarantee we will not experience the effect of inflation in the future. In addition, suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices, which impacts us primarily in the area of pharmaceutical drug costs in our Pharmacy Solutions segment. Changes in costs of drugs can be accompanied by a change in rate that we pass along to our customers. Additionally, our supply chain efforts have enabled us to effectively manage and mitigate any inflationary impacts in our supply chain over recent years. However, we cannot predict our ability to cover future cost increases. We have little or no ability to pass on certain of these increased costs associated with providing services to Medicare and Medicaid patients due to federal and state laws that establish fixed reimbursement rates. Interest Rate Risk Our Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our First Lien Facilities. Although we hedge a portion of our interest rate risk through interest rate swaps, any borrowings under our First Lien Facility in excess of the notional amount of the swaps will be subject to variable interest rates. By using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we expose ourselves to credit risk due to the possible failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. As of September 30, 2024, our debt outstanding was 2.7 billion and we had three interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of 2.0 billion that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. A hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would increase our net loss and decrease our cash flows by 6.5 million on an annual basis based upon our borrowing level at September 30, 2024. The market risks associated with our debt obligations as of September 30, 2024 have not changed from those reported in Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we are involved in various legal and/or administrative proceedings and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe the ultimate liability, if any, for outstanding proceedings or claims, individually or in the aggregate, in excess of amounts already provided in our consolidated financial statements, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. It is reasonably possible that an adverse determination might have an impact on a particular period. Regardless of the outcome, litigation has the potential to have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. For a summary of our material legal proceedings, refer to Note 10 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Ite m 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes to the risk factors affecting our business, financial condition, or results of operations from those set forth under the heading Summary Risk Factors or in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
