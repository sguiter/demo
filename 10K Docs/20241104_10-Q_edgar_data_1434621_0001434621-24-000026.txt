NOTE 3 
 Personal loans Other Consumer Total Consumer Insurance Other Total revenue 
 The Company derives its revenue primarily from match fees and closing fees. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied and promised services have transferred to the customer. The Company's services are generally transferred to the customer at a point in time. 
 Revenue from Home products is primarily generated from upfront match fees paid by mortgage Network Partners that receive a loan request, and in some cases upfront fees for clicks or call transfers. Match fees and upfront fees for clicks and call transfers are earned through the delivery of loan requests that originated through the Company's websites or affiliates. The Company recognizes revenue at the time a loan request is delivered to the customer, provided that no significant obligations remain. The Company's contractual right to the match fee consideration is contemporaneous with the satisfaction of the performance obligation to deliver a loan request to the customer. 
 Revenue from Consumer products is generated by match and other upfront fees for clicks or call transfers, as well as from closing fees, approval fees and upfront service and subscription fees. Closing fees are derived from lenders on certain auto loans, business loans, personal loans, and student loans when the lender funds a loan with the consumer. Approval fees are derived from credit card issuers when the credit card consumer receives card approval from the credit card issuer. Upfront service fees and subscription fees were derived from consumers in the Company's credit services product. Upfront fees paid by consumers were recognized as revenue over the estimated time the consumer was expected to remain a customer and receive services. Subscription fees were recognized over the period a consumer was receiving services. As of the second quarter of 2023, the Company discontinued providing its credit services product to consumers and no longer receives upfront or subscription fees. 
 The Company recognizes revenue on closing fees and approval fees at the point when a loan request or a credit card consumer is delivered to the customer. The Company's contractual right to closing fees and approval fees is not contemporaneous with the satisfaction of the performance obligation to deliver a loan request or a credit card consumer to the customer. As such, the Company records a contract asset at each reporting period-end related to the estimated variable consideration on closing fees and approval fees for which the Company has satisfied the related performance obligation but are still pending the loan closing or credit card approval before the Company has a contractual right to payment. This estimate is based on the Company's historical closing rates and historical time between when a consumer request for a loan or credit card is delivered to the lender or card issuer and when the loan is closed by the lender or approved by the card issuer. 
 Revenue from the Company's Insurance products is primarily generated from upfront match fees and upfront fees for website clicks or fees for calls. Match fees and upfront fees for clicks and call transfers are earned through the delivery of consumer requests that originated through the Company's websites or affiliates. The Company recognizes revenue at the time a consumer request is delivered to the customer, provided that no significant obligations remain. The Company's contractual right to the match fee consideration is contemporaneous with the satisfaction of the performance obligation to deliver a consumer request to the customer. 
 The contract asset recorded within prepaid and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets related to estimated variable consideration was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

million, that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2022. 
 Revenue recognized in any reporting period includes estimated variable consideration for which the Company has satisfied the related performance obligations but are still pending the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event outside the Company's control (such as lenders providing loans to consumers or credit card approvals of consumers) before the Company has a contractual right to payment. The Company recognizes increases or decreases to such revenue from prior periods. There was an increase of million in the third quarter of 2024, and there was a decrease of million in the third quarter of 2023.

 Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
 The Company's goodwill at each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of million associated with the Home segment, million associated with the Consumer segment, and million associated with the Insurance segment. 
 During the third quarter of 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred related to its goodwill and an interim quantitative impairment test was performed as of September 30, 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company s market capitalization fell below its book value. Additionally, the Home reporting unit continued to struggle due to the effects of the significant increases in mortgage rates, low for-sale home inventories and the rise in home prices. The Insurance reporting unit continued to see pressure due to the consumer price inflation negatively impacting carrier underwriting. Upon completing a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Insurance reporting unit exceeded its fair value which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million in the third quarter of 2023. The fair value of the Home and Consumer reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, indicating goodwill impairment. The Company will monitor the recovery of the Insurance reporting unit and Home reporting unit. Any changes in the timing of the recovery compared to current expectations could cause an impairment to the Insurance or Home reporting unit. 
 Intangible assets with indefinite lives relate to the Company's trademarks.

NOTE 7 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Company was informed that Stash executed a term sheet for additional funding. As a result, the Company determined there was an impairment indicator related to its Stash investment. The Company determined the fair value by predominately modeling its value of the investment based on the new funding terms. Based on the valuation of the Stash investment, the Company determined the estimated fair value was below the carrying value of the investment and recorded an impairment charge of million. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Company determined there was an impairment indicator related to its EarnUp investment and recorded an impairment charge of million. 
 In the third quarter of 2023, the Company determined there was an impairment indicator related to its Stash investment and performed a valuation of the investment. Based on the valuation, the Company determined the estimated fair value was below the carrying value of the investment and recorded an impairment charge of million. 
 In the second quarter of 2023, the Company recorded an impairment charge of million on one of its investments in equity securities.

 Effect of stock options Effect of dilutive share awards Weighted average diluted common shares 
 For the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, the Company was in a net loss position and, as a result, no potentially dilutive securities were included in the denominator for computing diluted loss per share, because the impact would have been anti-dilutive. Accordingly, the weighted average basic shares outstanding was used to compute loss per share. Approximately million shares related to potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. For the third quarter of 2024, the weighted average shares that were anti-dilutive, and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share, included options to purchase million shares of common stock and million restricted stock units. For the first nine months of 2024, the weighted average shares that were anti-dilutive, and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share, included options to purchase million shares of common stock and million restricted stock units. 
 For the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, the Company was in a net loss position and, as a result, no potentially dilutive securities were included in the denominator for computing diluted loss per share, because the impact would have been anti-dilutive. Accordingly, the weighted average basic shares outstanding was used to compute loss per share. An immaterial amount of shares related to potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. For the third quarter of 2023, the weighted average shares that were anti-dilutive, and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share, included options to purchase million shares of common stock and million restricted stock units. For the first nine months of 2023, the weighted average shares that were anti-dilutive, and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share, included options to purchase million shares of common stock and million restricted stock units. 
 The convertible notes and the warrants issued by the Company could be converted into the Company s common stock, subject to certain contingencies. See Note 12 Debt for additional information. 
 Approximately million and million shares in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, and approximately million and million shares in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, associated with the Convertible Senior Notes due July 15, 2025 were excluded from the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. Shares of the Company's common stock associated with the warrants issued by the Company in 2020 were excluded from the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 as they were anti-dilutive since the strike price of the warrants was greater than the average market price of the Company's common stock during the relevant periods. 
 Equity Distribution Agreement 
 In July 2024, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement in connection with the establishment of an ATM Equity Program (as defined in the 2024 Term Loan (as defined herein) agreement) under which the Company may sell up to an aggregate of million of shares of the Company's common stock. No sales were made under the Equity Distribution Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 The Company has a plan authorized for the repurchase of LendingTree's common stock. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the Company did t repurchase shares of its common stock. At September 30, 2024, approximately million of the previous authorizations to repurchase common stock remain available.

If the market price per share of the common stock, as measured under the terms of the 2020 Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the 2020 Warrants, the 2020 Warrants could have a dilutive effect, unless the Company elects, subject to certain conditions, to settle the 2020 Warrants in cash. 
 In connection with the repurchases of the 2025 Notes noted above, the Company entered into agreements with the counterparties for the 2020 Hedge and 2020 Warrants transactions to terminate the respective portions of these call spread transactions effective as of each settlement date in notional amounts corresponding to the principal amount of the 2025 Notes repurchased.

 Company Overview 
 LendingTree, Inc. is the parent of LT Intermediate Company, LLC, which holds all of the outstanding ownership interests of LendingTree, LLC, and LendingTree, LLC owns several companies. 
 We operate what we believe to be the leading online consumer platform that connects consumers with the choices they need to be confident in their financial decisions. We offer consumers tools and resources, including free credit scores, that facilitate comparison-shopping for mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, credit cards, deposit accounts, personal loans, student loans, small business loans, insurance quotes, sales of insurance policies and other related offerings. We primarily seek to match in-market consumers with multiple providers on our marketplace who can provide them competing quotes for loans, deposit products, insurance or other related offerings they are seeking. We also serve as a valued partner to lenders and other providers seeking an efficient, scalable and flexible source of customer acquisition with directly measurable benefits, by matching the consumer inquiries we generate with these providers. 
 Our Spring TM platform offers a personalized comparison-shopping experience, financial health advice and credit simulations by providing free credit scores and credit score analysis. This authenticated and secure platform enables us to monitor consumers' credit profiles, identify and alert them to changes in their financial health, and to recommend loans and other offerings on our marketplace that may be more favorable than the terms they may have at a given point in time. Customers can track the progress of their financial health over time based on actions they have taken and see recommended credit score improvement actions, and loans or other products offered by LendingTree. 
 We are focused on developing new product offerings and enhancements to improve the experience of consumers and Network Partners as they interact with us. By expanding our portfolio of financial services offerings, we are growing and diversifying our business and sources of revenue. We intend to capitalize on our expertise in performance marketing, product development and technology by leveraging the widespread recognition of the LendingTree brand. 
 We believe the consumer and small business financial services industry is in the middle stages of a fundamental shift to online product offerings, similar to the shift that started in retail and travel many years ago and is now well established. We believe that like retail and travel, as consumers continue to move towards online shopping and transactions for financial services, suppliers will increasingly shift their product offerings and advertising budgets toward the online channel. We believe the strength of our brands and of our Network Partners place us in a strong position to continue to benefit from this market shift.

 Economic Conditions 
 We continue to monitor the current global economic environment, specifically including inflationary pressures and interest rates, and any resulting impacts on our financial position and results of operations. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report for additional information. 
 During 2024, the challenging interest rate environment and inflationary pressures have continued to present challenges for many of our mortgage lending partners. In our Home segment, mortgage rates decreased slightly in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, but more than doubled compared to the low rates seen in the third quarter of 2021. The increased mortgage rates continue to cause reduced refinance volumes and continue to put pressure on purchase activity. In our Insurance segment, demand from our carrier partners has increased significantly and we continue to be optimistic about the remainder of 2024. 
 Segment Reporting 
 We have three reportable segments: Home, Consumer, and Insurance. 
 Recent Mortgage Interest Rate Trends 
 Interest rate and market risks can be substantial in the mortgage lead generation business. Short-term fluctuations in mortgage interest rates primarily affect consumer demand for mortgage refinancings, while long-term fluctuations in mortgage interest rates, coupled with the U.S. real estate market, affect consumer demand for new mortgages. Consumer demand, in turn, affects lender demand for mortgage leads from third-party sources, as well as our own ability to attract online consumers to our website. 
 Typically, when interest rates decline, we see increased consumer demand for mortgage refinancing, which in turn leads to increased traffic to our website and decreased selling and marketing efforts associated with that traffic. At the same time, lender demand for leads from third-party sources typically decreases, as there are more consumers in the marketplace seeking refinancings and, accordingly, lenders receive more organic mortgage lead volume. Due to lower lender demand, our revenue earned per consumer typically decreases, but with correspondingly lower selling and marketing costs. 
 Conversely, when interest rates increase, we typically see decreased consumer demand for mortgage refinancing, leading to decreased traffic to our website and higher associated selling and marketing efforts associated with that traffic. At the same time, lender demand for leads from third-party sources typically increases, as there are fewer consumers in the marketplace and, accordingly, the supply of organic mortgage lead volume decreases. Due to high lender demand, we typically see an increase in the amount lenders will pay per matched lead, which often leads to higher revenue earned per consumer. However, increases in the amount lenders will pay per matched lead in this situation is limited by the overall cost models of our lenders, and our revenue earned per consumer may be adversely affected by the overall reduced demand for refinancing in a rising rate environment. 
 We dynamically adjust selling and marketing expenditures in all interest rate environments to optimize our results against these variables. 
 According to Freddie Mac, the monthly average 30-year mortgage interest rates decreased from a monthly average of 6.82 in December 2023 to a monthly average of 6.18 in September 2024. On a quarterly basis, 30-year mortgage interest rates in the third quarter of 2024 averaged 6.51 , compared to 7.04 in the third quarter of 2023 and 7.29 in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Typically, as mortgage interest rates rise, there are fewer consumers in the marketplace seeking refinancings and, accordingly, the mix of mortgage origination dollars will move toward purchase mortgages. According to Mortgage Bankers Association MBA data, total refinance origination dollars increased to 25 of total mortgage origination dollars in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 15 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 14 in the third quarter of 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, total refinance origination dollars increased 135 from the fourth quarter of 2023 and increased 118 from the third quarter of 2023. Industry-wide mortgage origination dollars in the third quarter of 2024 increased 35 from the fourth quarter of 2023 and increased 21 from third quarter of 2023. 
 According to MBA projections, the mix of mortgage origination dollars is expected to continue to be weighted towards purchase mortgages with the refinance share representing approximately 28 for 2024 compared to 15 in 2023. 
 The U.S. Real Estate Market 
 The health of the U.S. real estate market and interest rate levels are the primary drivers of consumer demand for new mortgages. Consumer demand, in turn, affects lender demand for purchase mortgage leads from third-party sources. Typically, a strong real estate market will lead to reduced lender demand for leads, as there are more consumers in the marketplace seeking financing and, accordingly, lenders receive more organic lead volume. Conversely, a weaker real estate market will typically lead to an increase in lender demand, as there are fewer consumers in the marketplace seeking mortgages. 
 According to Fannie Mae data, existing home sales increased approximately 1 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and decreased approximately 2 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Fannie Mae predicts an overall decrease in existing-home sales of approximately 1 in 2024 compared to 2023.

 Spring TM 
 We consider certain metrics related to LendingTree Spring TM ("Spring") set forth below to help us evaluate our business and growth trends and assess operational efficiencies. We believe our Spring platform drives repeat user engagement resulting in lower acquisition costs and increases consumer lifetime value. The calculation of the metrics discussed below may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, securities analysts or investors. 
 We added 1.2 million net new users in the third quarter of 2024, bringing cumulative active users to 30.7 million as of September 30, 2024. We calculate the number of Spring users at a period end as the number of users that had an active account at any point during the quarter that includes the period end date. Users that deactivated their accounts prior to the most recent quarter are no longer considered in the user base at the end of the most recent quarter. We attribute approximately 5.8 million of revenue, or 2 of total revenue, in the third quarter of 2024 to registered Spring users who initiated their transaction from the Spring platform. During the third quarter of 2024, approximately 0.3 million Spring users initiated a transaction from the Spring platform that contributed to revenue. 
 Cost Reductions and Simplification of Business 
 On March 24, 2023, we committed to a workforce reduction plan (the Reduction Plan ), to reduce operating costs, which included the elimination of approximately 13 of our workforce. As a result of the Reduction Plan, we incurred approximately 5.3 million in severance charges in connection with the workforce reduction, 4.3 million of which was incurred in the first quarter of 2023 and 1.0 million was incurred in the second quarter of 2023. Part of this Reduction Plan included the shut down of our LendingTree customer call center as well as our Medicare insurance agency operations within QuoteWizard. We estimate the Reduction Plan reduced annual compensation expense by approximately 14 million, comprised of 2 million in cost of revenue, 4 million in selling and marketing expense, 3 million in general and administrative expense, and 5 million in product development. 
 Separately, in 2023, we made the decision to close our Ovation credit services business, an asset group within our Consumer segment, by mid- 2023. As a result, we recorded an asset impairment charge of 4.2 million in the first quarter of 2023 related to the write-off of certain long-term assets. Additionally, we incurred 2.1 million in severance charges in the second quarter of 2023 in connection with cash expenditures for employee separation costs. We acquired Ovation in 2018 to better serve those customers who come to LendingTree and receive suboptimal offers of credit. The business grew for a number of years before running into challenges in the wake of COVID-19, and more recently the industry has faced increased regulatory pressure. The business was capital-intensive, required elevated overhead, and future prospects were becoming uncertain. 
 The Ovation business accounted for approximately 3 of total revenue and 3 of total costs and expenses, with an immaterial impact to net income on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Regulations 
 Our revenue and earnings may fluctuate from time to time as a result of changes to federal, state, and industry-based laws and regulations, or changes to standards concerning the enforcement thereof. On January 26, 2024, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the FCC published regulations which, among other things, amend the consent requirements of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 to close what the FCC refers to as the lead generator loophole by requiring one-to-one consent for outbound telemarketing calls or texts made using an automatic telephone dialing system or pre-recorded or artificial voice messages to wireless or residential numbers. The new one-to-one consent rule is scheduled to take effect on January 27, 2025. 
 Although it remains unclear how these changes may ultimately be interpreted by courts or further revised by regulators, we anticipate that the required changes could have an adverse impact on the market for financial product and insurance quote requests and will require us and our third-party sources to modify our marketing practices and policies. While we have been proactively working to enhance our due diligence, contractual requirements, and oversight of lead generators, and will continue to analyze our marketing practices and policies and update as appropriate to mitigate the impact on our business and to ensure continuing compliance with the new rules, it is not possible to ensure that all lead generators and employees will comply with our policies and procedures at all times, which may result in potential litigation and regulatory exposure.

 Revenue 
 Revenue increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 due to increases in our Insurance segment partially offset by decreases in our Home and Consumer segments. 
 Our Consumer segment includes the following products: credit cards, personal loans, small business loans, student loans, auto loans, deposit accounts, and other credit products such as credit repair and debt settlement. The credit repair business was closed at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Many of our Consumer segment products are not individually significant to revenue. Revenue from our Consumer segment decreased 7.8 million, or 12 , in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in credit cards, partially offset by increases in business loans and personal loans.

 Revenue from our Consumer segment decreased 62.6 million, or 27 , in the first nine months of 2024 from the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to decreases in each of our consumer products, primarily our credit cards and other credit products. 
 Revenue from our personal loans product increased 1.3 million, or 5 , to 27.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 26.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in revenue was due to a 31 increase in volume, representing 6.5 million , partially offset by a 20 decrease in revenue earned per consumer, representing 5.2 million. Revenue from our personal loans product decreased 3.4 million, or 4 , to 74.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 78.3 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in revenue was due to an 18 decrease in revenue earned per consumer, representing 14.0 million of the decrease, partially offset by a 16 increase in volume, representing 10.6 million of an increase. We measure volume for our personal loans product as the number of unique consumers completing request forms. 
 For the current periods, no other products in our Consumer segment represented more than 10 of revenue; however, certain other Consumer products experienced notable changes. Revenue from our credit cards product decreased 8.5 million, or 58 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and decreased 34.6 million, or 64 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to a decrease in volume and revenue earned per click. We measure volume for our credit cards product as the number of consumers clicking through to a card issuer. Revenue from our small business loans product increased 3.7 million, or 32 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to an increase in revenue earned per consumer. Revenue from our other credit products decreased 12.4 million, or 46 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to the closure of our Ovation credit services business at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Revenue from our deposits product decreased 6.2 million or 45 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to a decrease in volume and revenue earned per consumer. 
 Our Home se gment includes the following products: purchase mortgage, refinance mortgage, and home equity loans and lines of credit. Revenue from our Home segment decreased 1.1 million, or 3 , in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in mortgage products partially offset by an increase in our home equity loans product, and decreased 23.8 million, or 20 , in the first nine months of 2024 from the first nine months of 2023 due to decreases in revenue from each of our Home products. 
 Revenue from our mortgage products decreased 2.1 million, or 16 , to 11.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 13.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in revenue was due to a 12 decrease in volume, representing 1.6 million of the decrease, and a 4 decrease in revenue earned per consumer, representing 0.5 million of the decrease. 
 Revenue from our mortgage products decreased 18.5 million, or 37 , to 31.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 49.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in revenue was due to a 30 decrease in volume, representing 13.4 million of the decrease, and a 10 decrease in revenue earned per consumer, representing 5.1 million of the decrease. We measure volume for our mortgage products as the number of consumers completing request forms. 
 Revenue from our purchase mortgage product decreased 10.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the number of consumers completing request forms and a decrease in revenue earned per consumer. Revenue from our refinance mortgage product decreased 7.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to a decrease in the number of consumers completing request forms and a decrease in revenue earned per consumer, as interest rates have risen. 
 Revenue from our home equity loans product decreased 5.3 million, or 8 , to 63.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 69.1 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in revenue was due to a 19 decrease in revenue earned per consumer, representing 13.3 million of the decrease, partially offset by a 14 increase in volume, representing a 8.0 million increase. We measure volume for our home equity loans and lines of credit products as the number of consumers completing request forms. 
 Revenue from our Insurance segment increased 114.5 million, or 210 , to 169.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 54.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in revenue was due to a 107 increase in revenue earned per consumer, representing 58.1 million of the increase, and a 50 increase in volume, representing 56.4 million of the increase. Revenue from our Insurance segment increased 187.0 million, or 98 , to 377.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 190.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in revenue was due to a 54 increase in revenue earned per consumer, representing 102.3 million of the increase, and a 29 increase in volume, representing 84.7 million of the

 increase. We measure volume for our insurance product as the number of consumer request forms and in certain cases re-engagement with a consumer, the number of such subsequent consumer engagements through our platform. 
 Cost of revenue 
 Cost of revenue consists primarily of costs associated with compensation and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) relating to internally-operated customer call centers, third-party customer call center fees, credit scoring fees, credit card fees, website network hosting, and server fees. 
 Cost of revenue increased 1.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to increases in direct costs associated with credit scoring and credit card fees, and compensation and benefits. Cost of revenue decreased 4.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 from the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits of 3.9 million. The decreases in the first nine months are primarily due to the Reduction Plan at the end of the first quarter of 2023, including shutting down the LendingTree customer call center, and the closure of the credit repair business at the end of the second quarter of 2023. 
 Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased to 4 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5 in the third quarter of 2023, and decreased to 4 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 6 in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Selling and marketing expense 
 Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of advertising and promotional expenditures and compensation and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) for personnel engaged in sales or marketing functions. Advertising and promotional expenditures primarily include online marketing, as well as television, print, and radio spending. Advertising production costs are expensed in the period the related ad is first run. 
 Selling and marketing expense increased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023 by 96.3 million, and increased 99.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to the changes in advertising and promotional expense discussed below. Additionally, compensation and benefits decreased 3.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Advertising and promotional expense is the largest component of selling and marketing expense, and is comprised of the following:

 In the periods presented, advertising and promotional expenses are equivalent to the non-GAAP measure variable marketing expense. See Variable Marketing Expense and Variable Marketing Margin below for additional information. 
 Revenue is primarily driven by Network Partner demand for our products, which is matched to corresponding consumer requests. We adjust our selling and marketing expenditures dynamically in relation to anticipated revenue opportunities in order to ensure sufficient consumer inquiries to profitably meet such demand. An increase in a product s revenue is generally met by a corresponding increase in marketing spend, and conversely a decrease in a product s revenue is generally met by a corresponding decrease in marketing spend. This relationship exists for our Home, Consumer, and Insurance segments. 
 We adjusted our advertising expenditures in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 in response to changes in Network Partner demand on our marketplace. We will continue to adjust selling and marketing expenditures dynamically in response to anticipated revenue opportunities.

 General and administrative expense 
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) for personnel engaged in finance, legal, tax, corporate information technology, human resources and executive management functions, as well as facilities and infrastructure costs and fees for professional services. 
 General and administrative expense remained relatively consistent in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023. General and administrative expense decreased in the first nine months of 2024 from the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits of 5.5 million, a decrease in fees and other charges of 1.5 million and a decrease in facilities expenses of 1.5 million. Additionally, we incurred a 4.2 million loss on the impairment of assets for our Ovation business in the first nine months of 2023. 
 General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 10 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 17 in the third quarter of 2023, and decreased to 12 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 17 in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Product development 
 Product development expense consists primarily of compensation and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) and third-party labor costs that are not capitalized, for employees and consultants engaged in the design, development, testing and enhancement of technology. 
 Product development expense remained consistent in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Product development expense decreased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to the Reduction Plan at the end of the first quarter of 2023. We continued to invest in internal development of new and enhanced features, functionality and business opportunities that we believe will enable us to better and more fully serve consumers and Network Partners. 
 Amortization of intangibles 
 The decrease in amortization of intangibles in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 was primarily due to certain intangible assets associated with our recent business acquisitions becoming fully amortized. 
 Goodwill impairment 
 In the third quarter of 2023, we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of 38.6 million in our Insurance reporting unit. See Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Part I. Item 1 Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 Restructuring and severance 
 During September 2023, we completed workforce reductions of 14 employees. We incurred approximately 0.9 million in severance charges in connection with the workforce reductions, consisting of cash expenditures for employee separation costs of approximately 0.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 and non-cash charges for the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards of approximately 0.2 million through the fourth quarter of 2023. The cash payments were completed by the third quarter of 2024. 
 On March 24, 2023, we committed to the Reduction Plan to reduce operating costs, which included the elimination of approximately 13 of our workforce. As a result of the Reduction Plan, we incurred approximately 5.3 million in severance charges in connection with the workforce reduction, consisting of cash expenditures for employee separation costs of approximately 4.3 million and non-cash charges for the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards of approximately 1.0 million. We incurred restructuring expense of 4.3 million in the first quarter of 2023 and an additional 1.0 million of restructuring expense in the second quarter of 2023 related to the Reduction Plan. 
 We made the decision to close the Ovation credit services business by mid-2023 and all operations ceased in August 2023. We incurred 2.1 million of restructuring expense related to the Ovation closure in the second quarter of 2023 in connection with cash expenditures for employee separation costs.

 Interest (expense) income 
 In March 2024, we drew 125.0 million on a first lien term loan facility and incurred 3.8 million and 8.0 million of interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 and first nine months of 2024, respectively. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased approximately 7.6 million in principal amount of our 0.50 Convertible Senior Notes due July 15, 2025 (the "2025 Notes") for 7.2 million. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of 0.5 million and an immaterial loss on the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, both of which are included in interest (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we repurchased approximately 161.3 million in principal amount of our 2025 Notes for 151.7 million plus accrued and unpaid interest of approximately 0.3 million. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of 9.6 million and a loss on the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of 1.0 million, both of which are included in interest (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 In the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased approximately 190.6 million in principal amount of our 2025 Notes for 156.3 million plus accrued and unpaid interest of approximately 0.1 million. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of 34.3 million, a loss on the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of 2.4 million, and incurred debt repayment costs of 1.0 million, all of which are included in interest (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 See Note 12 Debt, in Part I. Item 1 Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 Other expense 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we incurred impairment charges of 58.4 million related to two investments in equity securities. 
 In the third quarter of 2023, we incurred an impairment charge of 113.1 million related to an investment in equity securities. 
 See Note 7 - Equity Investment, in Part I. Item 1 Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 Income tax expense 
 For the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the change in the valuation allowance, net of the current period change in tax effected net indefinite-lived intangibles.

This measure excludes overhead, fixed costs and personnel-related costs. 
 
 Segment profit is our primary segment operating metric. Segment profit is calculated as segment revenue less segment selling and marketing expenses attributed to variable costs paid for advertising, direct marketing and related expenses that are directly attributable to the segments' products. See Note 15 Segment Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on segments and a reconciliation of segment profit to pre-tax income. 
 Home 
 Home segment revenue decreased 3 to 32.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023 and segment profit decreased 18 to 9.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023. Segment margin declined to 29 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 34 in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a decline in revenue earned per consumer, due to a decline in close rates at our lender partners. 
 Home equity revenue of 21.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 increased 0.9 million from 20.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Volume of home equity consumers completing request forms increased 25 in the third quarter of 2024

Table of Contents 

 compared to the third quarter of 2023, however, a 17 decline in revenue earned per consumer partially offset this volume growth. 
 Within Home, our core mortgage business generated revenue of 11.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 16 from the third quarter of 2023. Our refinance product within our mortgage business matches consumers in the market looking to refinance their existing mortgages with our network lenders. Our purchase product within our mortgage business matches consumers in the market looking to buy a new home with our network lenders. Our mortgage business is directly impacted by the mortgage market in which we participate. Our mortgage business continues to see headwinds from a lack of in-the-money refinance borrowers given the current higher level of mortgage rates, and subdued home sales have pressured the volume of consumers searching for purchase loans. 
 We believe financial market expectations for continued decreases in interest rates may benefit the mortgage and home equity lending environment and our Home segment. 
 Consumer 
 Our Consumer segment revenue decreased 12 to 59.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023, and segment profit decreased 19 to 28.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023 due to the decline in revenue. Segment margin was 47 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 51 in the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in revenue earned per consumer on certain products as well as a change in mix shift in the product revenue. 
 Personal loans revenue of 27.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 increased 5 from the third quarter of 2023 as lending standards remain restrictive at our lender partners. If financial market expectations for decreases in short-term interest rates remain as projected, we believe this would likely benefit our personal loans product in future quarters. 
 Small business revenue increased 32 in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023, as the lending appetite has remained stable from our partners. Additionally, the revenue growth has allowed us to invest more into marketing spend to capture high quality business owners searching for loans. 
 See the section titled "Revenue" above for additional discussion of declines in product revenues within the Consumer segment. 
 Insurance 
 Insurance revenue increased 210 to 169.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023 and segment profit increased 77 to 41.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023. Carrier demand for new auto insurance customers has been strong, with volume increasing 50 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, as two years of compounded premium rate increases combined with declines in the price of used vehicles and replacement parts has created a favorable underwriting environment. 
 Segment margin declined to 25 in the third quarter of 2024 from 43 in the third quarter of 2023. In 2023, we were able to exit from our highest cost marketing channels and continue to meet the decreased level of demand. In 2024, we re-entered those marketing channels to fill the increase in carrier demand, which has resulted in lower segment profit margin. 
 Variable Marketing Expense and Variable Marketing Margin 
 We report variable marketing expense and variable marketing margin as supplemental measures to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP".) These related measures are the primary metrics by which we measure the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Variable marketing expense represents the portion of selling and marketing expense attributable to variable costs paid for advertising, direct marketing, and related expenses, and excludes overhead, fixed costs, and personnel-related expenses. Variable marketing margin is a measure of the efficiency of our operating model, measuring revenue after subtracting variable marketing expense. Our operating model is highly sensitive to the amount and efficiency of variable marketing expenditures, and our proprietary systems are able to make rapidly changing decisions concerning the deployment of variable marketing expenditures (primarily but not exclusively online and mobile advertising placement) based on proprietary and sophisticated analytics. We believe that investors should have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. We provide and encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures discussed below.

 Variable marketing expense is defined as the expense attributable to variable costs paid for advertising, direct marketing and related expenses, and excluding overhead, fixed costs and personnel-related expenses. The majority of these variable advertising costs are expressly intended to drive traffic to our websites and these variable advertising costs are included in selling and marketing expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Variable marketing margin is defined as revenue less variable marketing expense. 
 The following shows the calculation of variable marketing margin:

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We report Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to GAAP. This measure is the primary metric by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our marketing expenditures and internal budgets are based and by which, in most years, management and many employees are compensated. We believe that investors should have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. We provide and encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures discussed below. 
 Definition of Adjusted EBITDA 
 We report Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted to exclude interest, income tax, amortization of intangibles and depreciation, and to further exclude (1) non-cash compensation expense, (2) non-cash impairment charges, (3) gain/loss on disposal of assets, (4) gain/loss on investments, (5) restructuring and severance expenses, (6) litigation settlements and contingencies, (7) acquisitions and dispositions income or expense (including with respect to changes in fair value of contingent consideration), (8) contributions to the LendingTree Foundation, (9) dividend income, and (10) one-time items. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our statement of operations of certain expenses, including depreciation, non-cash compensation and acquisition-related accounting. We endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measures with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 One-Time Items 
 Adjusted EBITDA is adjusted for one-time items, if applicable. Items are considered one-time in nature if they are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years, in accordance with SEC rules. For the periods presented below, there are no adjustments for one-time items. 
 Non-Cash Expenses that are Excluded from Adjusted EBITDA 
 Non-cash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options, some of which awards have performance-based vesting conditions. Non-cash compensation expense also includes expense associated with employee stock purchase plans. These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our calculations of fully diluted shares outstanding. Upon settlement of restricted stock units, exercise of certain stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards, the awards may be settled, on a net basis, with us remitting the required tax withholding amount from our current funds. 
 Amortization of intangibles are non-cash expenses relating primarily to intangible assets acquired through acquisitions. At the time of an acquisition, the intangible assets of the acquired company, such as purchase agreements, technology and customer relationships, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives.

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 96.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to 112.1 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased approximately 7.6 million in principal amount of our 2025 Notes for 7.2 million. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of 0.5 million and an immaterial loss on the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, both of which are included in interest (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we repurchased approximately 161.3 million in principal amount of our 2025 Notes for 151.7 million plus accrued and unpaid interest of approximately 0.3 million. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of 9.6 million and a loss on the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of 1.0 million, both of which are included in interest (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 We expect our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our credit facilities to be sufficient to fund our operating needs for the next twelve months and beyond. We will continue to monitor the impact of the current economic conditions, including interest rates and inflation on our liquidity and capital resources. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have 115.3 million outstanding on the 2025 Notes. We intend to use cash on hand, available borrowings of 50.0 million from the 2024 Term Loan (as defined below), and future cash flows from operations for the repayment of the 2025 Notes.

 Equity Distribution Agreement 
 In July 2024, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement in connection with the establishment of an ATM Equity Program (as defined in the 2024 Term Loan (as defined herein) agreement) under which we may sell up to an aggregate of 50.0 million of shares of the our common stock. No sales were made under the Equity Distribution Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Credit Facilities 
 On September 15, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ), consisting of a 200.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility ), which matures on September 15, 2026, and a 250.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the 2021 Term Loan and together with the Revolving Facility, the Credit Facility ), which matures on September 15, 2028. The proceeds of the Revolving Facility can be used to finance working capital, for general corporate purposes and any other purpose not prohibited by the Credit Agreement. We borrowed 250.0 million under the delayed draw term loan on May 31, 2022 and used 170.2 million of the proceeds to settle our 0.625 Convertible Senior Notes due June 1, 2022 ("2022 Notes"), including interest. The remaining proceeds of 79.8 million may be used for general corporate purposes and any other purposes not prohibited by the Credit Agreement. 
 As of November 1, 2024, we have outstanding 244.4 million under the 2021 Term Loan and the remaining borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility is 200.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we have 20.0 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility. 
 On March 27, 2024, we entered a first lien term loan facility (the 2024 Term Loan ), consisting of 175.0 million which matures on March 27, 2031. We drew 125.0 million of the 2024 Term Loan upon closing while the remaining 50.0 million will be available as a delayed draw term loan until March 27, 2025. The proceeds of the 2024 Term Loan were used to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the closing of the 2024 Term Loan and delayed draw term loan, and will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of our 2025 Notes. The funding had a 3.1 million original issue discount and associated debt issuance costs of 4.3 million. 
 We filed an ATM Shelf Registration (as defined in the 2024 Term Loan agreement) with the SEC in the third quarter of 2024. In the event of a default in the minimum Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2024 Term Loan agreement) covenant in the 2024 Term Loan, we are required to utilize the ATM Equity Program (as defined in the 2024 Term Loan agreement) to sell common stock and use the proceeds to cure the event of default in the minimum Consolidated EBITDA covenant. Additionally, we may use the ATM Equity Program to maintain the 40.0 million minimum cash balance requirement in the 2024 Term Loan. 
 As of November 1, 2024, we had 118.8 million borrowings outstanding under the 2024 Term Loan. 
 See Note 12 Debt, in Part I. Item 1 Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 Cash Flows 
 Our cash flows are as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 46,022 46,692 Net cash used in investing activities (8,396) (9,928) Net cash used in financing activities (52,894) (160,150) 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Our largest source of cash provided by our operating activities is revenues generated by our products. Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include advertising and promotional payments. In addition, our uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and other employee-related costs, other general corporate expenditures, litigation settlements and contingencies, and income taxes. 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 Net cash provided by operating activities remained relatively consistent in the first nine months of 2024 from the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to unfavorable changes in accounts receivable, partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 consisted of capital expenditures primarily related to internally developed software. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 consisted primarily of the repurchase of the 2025 Notes for 158.8 million, term loan repayments of 8.8 million and 2.8 million in withholding taxes paid upon surrender of shares to satisfy obligations on equity awards, net of proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by 117.8 million net proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan. 
 Net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2023 consisted primarily of the repurchase of the 2025 Notes for 156.3 million. 
 
 New Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Estimates 
 For information regarding new accounting pronouncements and critical accounting estimates, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies, in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements . 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks as a result of changes to interest rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Other than our Credit Facility and the 2024 Term Loan, we do not have any financial instruments that are exposed to significant market risk. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents in bank deposits and short-term, highly liquid money market investments. A hypothetical 100-basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our cash equivalents securities, or our earnings on such cash equivalents, but would have a 2.4 million annual effect on the interest paid on borrowings under the Credit Facility and a 1.2 million annual effect on the interest paid on borrowings under the 2024 Term Loan. As of November 1, 2024, the Company had 244.4 million outstanding on its 2021 Term Loan, and there were no outstanding borrowings under its Revolving Facility. As of November 1, 2024, the Company had 118.8 million outstanding on its 2024 Term Loan, which was entered into on March 27, 2024. 
 
 Fluctuations in interest rates affect consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity which, in turn, affects lender demand for mortgage leads. Typically, when interest rates decline, we see increased consumer demand for mortgage refinancing, which in turn leads to increased traffic to our website and decreased selling and marketing efforts associated with that traffic. At the same time, lender demand for leads from third-party sources typically decreases, as there are more consumers in the marketplace seeking refinancings and, accordingly, lenders receive more organic lead volume. Due to lower lender demand, our revenue earned per consumer typically decreases but with correspondingly lower selling and marketing costs. Conversely, when interest rates increase, we typically see decreased consumer demand for mortgage refinancing, leading to decreased traffic to our website and higher associated selling and marketing efforts associated with that traffic. At the same time, lender demand for leads from third-party sources typically increases, as there are fewer consumers in the marketplace and, accordingly, the supply of organic mortgage lead volume decreases. Due to high lender demand, we typically see an increase in the amount lenders will pay per matched lead, which often leads to higher revenue earned per consumer. However, increases in the amount lenders will pay per matched lead in this situation is limited by the overall cost models of our lenders, and our revenue earned per consumer can be adversely affected by the overall reduced demand for refinancing in a rising rate environment.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), management, with the participation of our principal executive officer (our Chief Executive Officer) and principal financial officer (our Chief Financial Officer), evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective, as of September 30, 2024, to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed and filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified, and that management will be timely alerted to material information required to be included in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are party to litigation involving property, contract, intellectual property, data privacy and security, and a variety of other claims. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage. On or about October 29, 2019, Joseph Mantha filed a class action lawsuit against QuoteWizard.com, LLC alleging claims in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. On August 16, 2024, the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts granted the plaintiff s motion to certify a class. This case is set for mediation on November 13, 2024. 
 In addition to the foregoing, we have provided information about certain legal proceedings in which we are involved in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of our 2023 Annual Report and updated that information in Note 13 Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Risk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A " Risk Factors ," in our 2023 Annual Report. There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 You should carefully consider the risks described in our 2023 Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2023 Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 In each of February 2018 and February 2019, the board of directors authorized and we announced a stock repurchase program which allowed for the repurchase of up to 100.0 million and 150.0 million, respectively, of our common stock. Under this program, we can repurchase stock in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions. We have used available cash to finance these repurchases. We will determine the timing and amount of any additional repurchases based on our evaluation of market conditions, applicable SEC guidelines and regulations, and other factors. This program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the discretion of our board of directors. Our 2024 Term Loan limits stock repurchases. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no shares of common stock were repurchased under the stock repurchase program. As of November 1, 2024, approximately 96.7 million remains authorized for share repurchase. 
 Additionally, the LendingTree 2023 Stock Plan and LendingTree 2023 Inducement Grant Plan allows employees to elect for us to withhold (or take back, with respect to restricted stock awards) shares of our common stock to satisfy federal and state withholding obligations upon the exercise of stock options, the settlement of restricted stock unit awards and the vesting of restricted stock awards granted to those individuals under the plans. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, 10,714 shares were withheld related to these obligations under the LendingTree 2023 Stock Plan. The withholding of those shares does not affect the dollar amount or number of shares that may be purchased under the stock repurchase program described above.
