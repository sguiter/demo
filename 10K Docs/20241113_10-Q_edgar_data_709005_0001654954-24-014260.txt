This refund applied both to Noble Roman s, Inc. and its subsidiary, RH Roanoke, Inc. Although the refund was recorded in the first quarter of 2023, it effectively reimbursed for expenses and lost revenue that occurred over several prior quarters which distorts the comparability of the nine months of 2024 with the nine months of 2023. To date the Company has received all five quarterly refunds for Roanoke, Inc. and three refunds for 2020 and one of the two quarterly refunds for 2021 for Noble Roman s, Inc. In recent communications, the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ), indicated the final refund claim had been received and was in process, but the IRS was significantly behind in processing refunds and would get caught up as soon as possible. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2023-09 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 for fiscal year ending December 31, 2025. Management does not believe that there are any recently issued and effective or not yet effective accounting pronouncements as of September 30, 2024 that would have or are expected to have any significant effect on the Company s financial position, cash flows or income statement. 8 Table of Contents Marketing materials Equipment inventory Total ) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

At December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the carrying values of the Company s franchise receivables have been reduced to anticipated realizable value. After considering this reduction of carrying value, the Company anticipates that substantially all of its accounts receivable reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, will be collected. During the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 there were no Company-operated or franchised Craft Pizza Pub restaurants opened or closed. There have been 51 new non-traditional locations opened thus far this year.

The World Health Organization recognized COVID as a pandemic in March 2020. In response to the pandemic, the U.S. federal government and various state and local governments, among other things, imposed travel and business restrictions, including stay-at-home orders and other guidelines that required restaurants and bars to close or restrict inside dining. The pandemic resulted in significant economic volatility, uncertainty and disruption, reduced commercial activity and weakened economic conditions in the regions in which the Company and its franchisees operate. The pandemic and the governmental response had a significant adverse impact on the Company, due to, among other things, governmental restrictions, reduced customer traffic, staffing challenges and supply difficulties. Many states and municipalities in the United States, including Indiana where all of the Company-owned Craft Pizza Pub restaurants are located, have from time to time temporarily restricted travel and suspended the operations of dine-in restaurants and other businesses in light of COVID which negatively affected the Company s operations. Host facilities for the Company s non-traditional franchises were also affected by labor shortages which adversely impacted those developments and in turn slowed the sales of franchises. In addition locations in the entertainment segment were forced and, in most states, required them to be closed for two years. Most of those locations did not have the financial ability left after that closure to reopen. The uncertainty and disruption in the U.S. economy caused by the pandemic are likely to continue to adversely impact the volume and resources of some potential franchisees for both the Company s Craft Pizza Pub and non-traditional venues. As described in Note 1 above, the Company applied for and has received payments in respect of the ERTC provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act enacted to address the economic effects of the pandemic and related shut-down orders imposed on businesses. Although the refund was recorded in the first quarter of 2023, it reflected expenses and lost revenue incurred by the Company over several prior quarters which distorts the comparability of the results for first quarter and nine months of 2024 with the corresponding periods of 2023. 12 Table of Contents ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Noble Roman s, Inc., an Indiana corporation incorporated in 1972, sells and services franchises and licenses and operates Company-owned stand-alone restaurants and non-traditional foodservice operations under the trade names Noble Roman s Craft Pizza Pub, Noble Roman s Pizza, Noble Roman s Take-N-Bake, and Tuscano s Italian Style Subs. References in this report to the Company are to Noble Roman s, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. The Company s only operating subsidiary is RH Roanoke, Inc., which operates a Company-owned non-traditional location. The Company has been operating, franchising and licensing Noble Roman s Pizza operations in a variety of stand-alone and non-traditional locations across the country since 1972. Its first Craft Pizza Pub location opened in January 2017 as a Company-operated restaurant in a northern suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana. Since then, the Company opened a total of eight more Company-operated Craft Pizza Pub locations in 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021. The Company-operated locations serve as the base for what it sees as a significant potential future growth driver, including additional Company operated locations and franchising its full-service restaurant format to experienced, multi-unit restaurant operators with a track record of success. In addition to the nine Company-operated Craft Pizza Pub locations, during 2019 and 2020 the Company had three franchised locations opened. Today, in total, there are 12 Craft Pizza Pub locations in operation. Noble Roman s Pizza for Non-Traditional Locations In 1997, the Company started franchising non-traditional locations (a Noble Roman s pizza operation within some other host business or activity with existing traffic) such as entertainment facilities, hospitals, convenience stores and other types of facilities. Today the Company is focusing primarily on convenience stores and travel plazas for rapid expansion of its non-traditional franchises. These locations offer the two pizza styles the Company started with in 1972, along with its great tasting, high quality ingredients and menu extensions. The hallmark of Noble Roman s Pizza for non-traditional locations is Superior quality that our customers can taste. Every ingredient and process has been designed with a view to produce superior results. A fully-prepared pizza crust that captures the made-from-scratch pizzeria flavor which gets delivered to non-traditional locations in a shelf-stable condition so that dough handling is no longer an impediment to a consistent product, which otherwise is a challenge in non-traditional locations. Fresh packed, uncondensed and never cooked sauce made with secret spices and vine-ripened tomatoes in all venues. 100 real cheese blended from mozzarella and Muenster, with no additives or extenders. 100 real meat toppings, with no soy additives or extenders, a distinction compared to many pizza concepts. 13 Table of Contents Vegetables (like onions and green peppers) and mushrooms for pizzas are sliced and delivered fresh, never canned. An extended product line that includes breadsticks and cheesy stix with dip, pasta, baked sandwiches, salads, wings and a line of breakfast products. The fully-prepared crust also forms the basis for the Company s Take-N-Bake pizza for use as an add-on component for its non-traditional franchise and licensing base. As discussed under Impact of COVID Pandemic above, revenue from the franchising venue declined in 2021 and early 2022 due to the number of government-forced closures in an attempt to prevent the spread of COVID. The franchising section was made up of a number of franchises located in all types of entertainment facilities such as bowling centers and family entertainment centers. The regulations varied in different states but for the most part closing orders were in effect for two years after which most of those franchisees did not have the financial means of reopening. The Company refocused its development plans toward selling more non-traditional franchises as a result of the pandemic coming to an end and the owners of non-traditional locations becoming more willing to look at expansion options and to invest in their growth. The focus on selling more non-traditional franchise locations, including several locations with higher-than-average potential volumes, is proceeding. The Company has sold and still has a significant pipeline of prospects to expand the number of franchise locations. In October 2023 the Company entered into a Development Agreement with Majors Management, LLC Majors for 100 franchise locations to be developed over the succeeding three years. Currently Majors has opened approximately 43 of the 100 franchised locations. Noble Roman s Craft Pizza Pub The Noble Roman s Craft Pizza Pub format incorporates many of the basic elements first introduced in 1972 but in a modern atmosphere with up-to-date baking technology and equipment to maximize speed, enhance quality and perpetuate the taste customers love and expect from a Noble Roman s. The Noble Roman s Craft Pizza Pub provides for a selection of over 40 different toppings, cheeses and sauces from which to choose. Beer and wine also are featured, with 16 different beers on tap including both national and local craft selections. Wines include 16 affordably priced options by the bottle or glass in a range of varietals. Beer and wine service is provided at the bar and throughout the dining room. The Company designed the system to enable fast cook times, with oven speeds running approximately 2.5 minutes for traditional pizzas and 5.75 minutes for Sicilian pizzas. Popular pizza favorites such as pepperoni are options on the menu but also offered is a selection of Craft Pizza Pub original pizza creations. The menu also features a selection of contemporary and fresh, made-to-order salads and fresh-cooked pasta. The menu also incorporates baked sub sandwiches, hand-sauced wings and a selection of desserts, as well as Noble Roman s famous Breadsticks with Delicious Cheese Sauce, most of which have been offered in its locations since 1972. In 2022, new salad bars were rolled out over time across all Company-operated restaurants. Additional enhancements include a glass enclosed Dough Room where Noble Roman s Dough Masters hand make all pizza and breadstick dough from scratch in customer view. Kids and adults enjoy Noble Roman s self-serve root beer tap, which is also part of a special menu for customers 12 and younger. Throughout the dining room and the bar area there are many giant screen television monitors for sports and the nostalgic black and white shorts featured in Noble Roman s since 1972. 14 Table of Contents The Company designed its curbside service for carry-out customers, called Pizza Valet Service, to create added value and convenience. With Pizza Valet Service, customers place orders ahead, drive into the restaurant s reserved valet parking spaces and have their pizza run to their vehicle by specially uniformed pizza valets. Customers who pay when they place their orders are able to drive up and leave with their order very quickly without stepping out of their vehicle. For those who choose to pay after they arrive, pizza valets can take credit card payments on their mobile payment devices right at the customer s vehicle. With the fast baking times, the entire experience, from order to pick-up can take as little as 12 minutes. Business Strategy The Company is focused on revenue expansion while carefully managing corporate-level overhead expenses. The Company refocused its development plans toward selling more non-traditional franchises as a result of the pandemic coming to an end and the owners of non-traditional locations becoming more willing to look at expansion options and to invest in their growth. The Company has a significant pipeline of leads and prospects for future non-traditional franchise sales as well as a significant number of franchised locations sold but not yet open. The initial franchise fees for a Noble Roman s Pizza non-traditional location or a Craft Pizza Pub location are as follows: Non-Traditional Except Hospitals Non-Traditional Hospitals Traditional Stand-Alone Either a Noble Roman s Pizza or Craft Pizza Pub 7,500 10,000 30,000 The franchise fees are paid upon signing the franchise agreement and, when paid, are non-refundable in consideration of the administration and other expenses incurred by the Company in granting the franchises and for the lost and/or deferred opportunities to grant such franchises to any other party. Business Operations Distribution The Company s proprietary ingredients are manufactured pursuant to the Company s specifications or recipes by third-party manufacturers under contracts between the Company and its various manufacturers. These contracts require the manufacturers to produce ingredients meeting the Company s specifications and to sell them to Company-approved third-party distributors at prices negotiated between the Company and the manufacturer. The Company has third-party distributors strategically located throughout the United States. The agreements require the distributors to maintain adequate inventories of all ingredients necessary to meet the needs of the Company s franchisees and licensees in their distribution areas for weekly deliveries to the franchisee. Each of the primary distributors purchases the ingredients from the manufacturers at prices negotiated between the Company and the manufacturers, but under payment terms agreed upon by the manufacturers and the distributor, and distributes the ingredients to the franchisee at a price determined by the distributor agreement. Payment terms to the distributor are agreed upon between each franchisee and the respective distributor. 15 Table of Contents Financial Summary The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its assets, including property, equipment and related costs, accounts receivable and deferred tax assets, to assess whether any impairment indications are present. If any impairment of an individual asset is evident, a charge will be provided to reduce the carrying value to its estimated fair value. The following table sets forth the revenue, expense and margin contribution of the Company s Craft Pizza Pub venue and the percentage relationship to its revenue: Description Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2023 2024 2023 2024 Revenue 2,175,219 100 2,195,167 100 6,639,213 100 6,413,242 100 Cost of sales 430,826 19.8 469,197 21.4 1,359,126 20.5 1,350,131 21.1 Salaries and wages 643,081 29.6 632,823 28.8 1,913,450 28.8 1,855,157 28.9 Facility cost including rent, common area and utilities 399,684 18.4 410,624 18.7 1,210,276 18.2 1,191,496 18.6 Packaging 71,586 3.3 70,765 3.2 220,694 3.4 199,838 3.1 Third-party delivery fees 26,227 1.2 45,156 2.1 86,444 1.3 146,640 2.3 All other operating expenses 403,230 18.5 393,263 17.9 1,124,658 16.9 1,088,282 16.9 Total expenses 1,974,635 90.8 2,021,828 92.1 5,914,648 89.1 5,831,544 90.9 Margin contribution 200,584 9.2 173,339 7.9 724,565 10.9 581,698 9.1 The following table sets forth the revenue, expense and margin contribution of the Company s franchising venue and the percentage relationship to its revenue: Description Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2023 2024 2023 2024 Royalties and fees franchising 1,310,284 100 1,437,697 100 3,671,160 100 4,298,735 100 Salaries and wages 193,781 14.8 222,910 15.5 648,342 17.7 685,321 15.9 Franchise promotion expense 44,936 3.4 60,105 4.2 229,056 6.2 180,682 4.2 Travel and auto 37,908 2.9 40,038 2.8 96,057 2.6 122,404 2.8 All other operating expenses (benefit) 119,152 9.1 176,728 12.3 (1,009,710 (27.5 461,736 10.8 Total expenses 395,777 30.2 499,781 34.8 (36,255 (1.0 1,450,143 33.7 Margin contribution 914,507 69.8 937,916 65.2 3,707,415 101 2,848,592 66.3 16 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the revenue, expense and margin contribution of the Company-owned non-traditional venue and the percentage relationship to its revenue: Description Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2023 2024 2023 2024 Revenue 247,252 100 218,193 100 707,217 100 693,045 100 Total expenses 240,245 97.2 269,674 123.6 566,225 80.1 730,723 105.4 Margin contribution (loss) 7,007 2.8 (51,481 (23.6 140,992 19.9 (37,676 (5.4 Results of Operations Company-Owned Craft Pizza Pub The revenue from this venue increased from 2.175 million to 2.195 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023, and decreased from 6.64 million to 6.41 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in revenue for the three-month period was a result of a recent turnaround in same store sales over a year ago and the decrease in revenue for the nine-month period was the result of declines in same store sales earlier in the year due to the weakness in consumer spending resulting from an increase in credit card debt, an increase in gas prices and overall inflation resulting in less disposable income resulting in consumers spending less on each trip out. Since the end of the third quarter, sales have continued to trend over same weeks in 2023 at a faster pace. Cost of sales, as a percentage of revenue, increased from 19.8 to 21.4 for the three-month period and from 20.5 to 21.1 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The Company has incurred significant increases in product cost, especially with cheese prices, but was able to offset some of that extra cost after manufacturer negotiations, with internal adjustments to operating systems and with efficiency gained in operations as staffing levels stabilized and employee experience levels increased. Salaries and wages, as a percentage of revenue, decreased from 29.6 to 28.8 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023, and increased from 28.8 to 28.9 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The cost of salaries and wages has increased significantly due to the competitive environment for available labor caused by the general shortage of available labor, which was partially offset by a menu price increase in early 2022. The Company, in October 2024, took a small menu price increase which was the first increase since early 2022. The Company has largely offset the salary and wage increases with more efficient planning and supervision of labor usage. Gross margin contribution as a percentage of revenue was 7.9 and 9.1 for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.2 and 10.9 for the corresponding periods in 2023. The decrease in margin was primarily due to the increase in cost of sales, increase in cost of third-party deliveries and small increase in facility cost mostly as a result of increased utility costs. 17 Table of Contents Franchising Total revenue was 1.44 million and 4.30 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.31 million and 3.67 million for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively. Franchising revenue reflected strong increase in both the three-month and nine-month periods over the corresponding periods in 2023 because of the increase in number of franchise locations opened in these periods. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recognized that with the pandemic winding down non-traditional locations, particularly in the convenience stores and travel plazas, were strongly considering better food options to grow their business and increase their margins. By shifting emphasis to growth in the non-traditional segment the Company was able to take advantage of that new opportunity without incurring additional overhead. The interest in new growth opportunities in this venue is continuing, and with new franchise agreements and the backlog of prospects, this trend is expected to continue. In addition, on October 27, 2023, the Company entered into a Development Agreement with Majors Management, LLC Majors for the development of 100 new non-traditional franchise locations. The Development Agreement requires the developer to have 31 locations open by June 30, 2024, 50 locations open by December 31, 2024, with the remainder of the 100 locations to be open by September 30, 2026. Due to Majors employee issues, which have delayed opening new locations, they are expected to be slightly short of the 50 locations opened by December 31, 2024 and the Company has granted them a waiver on that requirement without changing the requirements for future periods. Salaries and wages, franchise promotion expense, insurance and other operating costs as a percentage of revenue were 19.3 and 17.8 for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.4 and (18.7) , respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2023. The Company applied for and has received payments in respect of the ERTC provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act enacted to address the economic effects of the pandemic and related shut-down orders imposed on businesses. Although the refund was recorded in the first quarter of 2023, it reflected expenses and lost revenue incurred by the Company over several prior quarters which distorts the comparability of the results for the nine months of 2024 with the corresponding period in 2023. Margin contribution was 65.2 and 66.3 , as a percentage of revenue, for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 69.8 and 101 for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively. The increase in margin contribution during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was a result of the growth in revenue, as described above, plus a corresponding reduction of operating expenses. The Company applied for and has received payments in respect of the ERTC provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act enacted to address the economic effects of the pandemic and related shut-down orders imposed on businesses. Although the refund was recorded in the first quarter of 2023, it reflected expenses and lost revenue incurred by the Company over several prior quarters which distorts the comparability of the results for the nine months of 2024 with the corresponding period in 2023. Even though the periods are not comparable, as described above, current year performance does show that extra revenue generated by the opening of new locations highly contributes to future net income based on this demonstrative margin. 18 Table of Contents Company-Owned Non-Traditional Locations Gross revenue was 218,000 and 693,000 during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 247,000 and 707,000 for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as a result of a major expansion in the hospital bed capacity, the cafeteria area which contains in part the Noble Roman s Pizza and Tuscano s Subs facilities, were closed and moved to a temporary location with very limited hours resulting in a decrease in sales during that period. That cafeteria remodeling has now been completed in October and both the Noble Roman s and Tuscano s have returned to their prior positions and regular hours and sales have thus far increased to more than they were prior to the temporary shutdown. The Company does not intend to operate any more Company-owned non-traditional locations except the one location that it is currently operating. Total expenses were 270,000 and 731,000 for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 240,000 and 566,000 for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively. The Company applied for and has received payments in respect of the ERTC provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act enacted to address the economic effects of the pandemic and related shut-down orders imposed on businesses. Although the refund was recorded in the first quarter of 2023, it reflected expenses and lost revenue incurred by the Company over several prior quarters which distorts the comparability of the results for the nine months of 2024 with the corresponding period in 2023. To compound the non-comparability was the closure of the locations in their normal position and move to a temporary location with limited hours. Corporate Level Results of Operations Depreciation and amortization were 96,000 and 289,000 for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 96,000 and 287,000 for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively. Depreciation remains relatively constant as the Company has not added any new Craft Pizza Pub locations in the last two years. General and administrative expenses were 566,000 and 1.71 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 519,000 and 1.56 million for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively. The Company maintained tight control of its operating expenses while growing its franchising revenue. Operating income was 417,000 and 1.41 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 514,000 and 2.74 million for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively. The comparability of results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is limited because operating income of 2.74 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 1.46 million of reimbursement of expenses by the ERTC refund which related to periods before the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Without that refund being recorded in the first quarter of 2023, the Company would have reported an operating income of approximately 1.28 million. The ERTC refund reflected excess costs and lost revenue incurred by the Company as a result of government restrictions in an attempt to prevent the spread of a novel strain of COVID. Interest expense was 416,000 and 1.24 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 359,000 and 1.12 million for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively. The interest expense was reduced by the monthly principal payments required by the loan agreement in addition to voluntary payments to amortize principal totaling approximately 579,000, offset by an increase in principal by adding the PIK note interest to the principal amount each month and the increase in the variable rate of the Corbel loan which is tied to SOFR plus 7.75 for cash payments plus other accruals. 19 Table of Contents The fair market value of the Company s outstanding warrants decreased from 731,037 to 538,822 as computed by an outside expert using the Black-Scholes method of calculation for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. As a result of the above factors, net income was 193 thousand and 164 thousand for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 154.5 thousand and 1.35 million for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively. The comparability of results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is limited because net income of 1.35 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 1.46 million of reimbursement of expenses claimed on amended IRS 941 returns in accordance with ERTC provisions net of expenses to prepare the amended 941 returns which related to periods before the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Without that refund being recorded in the first quarter of 2023, the Company would have reported a net loss of approximately 110,000. The ERTC refund reflected excess costs and lost revenue incurred by the Company as a result of government restrictions in an attempt to prevent the spread of a novel strain of COVID. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company s current ratio was .3-to-1 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1-to-1 as of December 31, 2023. As the Company reported previously, it is pursuing plans for new financing to repay the Corbel loan and to repay the subordinated notes. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the financing as planned on favorable terms. However, based on its credit metrics, including its recent and forecasted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, the Company believes it will be able to complete the refinancing. Based on terms indicated in ongoing discussions between the Company and potential lenders, the Company currently expects the financing will result in a reduction in its effective interest rate and without any equity-dilutive provisions such as were present in its current financing arrangement with Corbel. In January 2017, the Company completed the offering of 2.4 million principal amount of subordinated promissory notes (the Notes convertible into common stock at 0.50 per share and warrants to purchase up to 2.4 million shares of the Company s Common Stock at an exercise price of 1.00 per share, subject to adjustment. In 2018, 400,000 principal amount of Notes was converted into 800,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock, in January 2019 another Note in the principal amount of 50,000 was converted into 100,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock, and in August 2019 another Note in the principal amount of 50,000 was converted into 100,000 shares of Common Stock, leaving principal amounts of Notes of 1.9 million outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Holders of Notes in the principal amount of 775,000 extended their maturity date to January 31, 2023. In February 2020, 1.275 million principal amount of the Notes was repaid in conjunction with a new financing leaving a principal balance of 625,000 of Notes outstanding due January 31, 2023. In April 2023, a Note in the principal amount of 50,000 was repaid by the Company, with the approval of senior lender, leaving 575,000 outstanding. These Notes bear interest at 10 per annum, including the Notes which have not been extended, paid quarterly and are convertible to Common Stock any time prior to maturity at the option of the holder at 0.30 per share. In February 2020, the Company entered into the Agreement with Corbel, pursuant to which the Company issued to Corbel the Senior Note in the initial principal amount of 8.0 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the Agreement as follows: (i) 4.2 million to repay the Company s then-existing bank debt which were in the original amount of 6.1 million; (ii) 1.275 million to repay the portion of the Company s existing subordinated convertible debt the maturity date of which most had not previously been extended; (iii) to pay debt issuance costs; and (iv) for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including development of new Company-owned Craft Pizza Pub locations. 20 Table of Contents The Senior Note bears cash interest of SOFR, as defined in the Agreement, plus 7.75 . In addition, the Senior Note requires PIK Interest of 3 per annum, which is added to the principal amount of the Senior Note. Interest is payable in arrears on the last calendar day of each month. The Senior Note matures on February 7, 2025. The Senior Note, as amended currently, requires principal payments of 83,333 per month and continuing until maturity. In July 2023, the Company voluntarily prepaid principal of approximately 579,000. See Note 1 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for discussion of funds received from the ERTC. As a result of the financial arrangements described above and the Company s cash flow projections, the Company believes it will have sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations and to carry out its current business plan. The Company s cash flow projections for the next two years are primarily based on the Company s strategy of growing the non-traditional franchising/licensing venues, operating Craft Pizza Pub locations and pursuing a franchising program for Craft Pizza Pub restaurants as market conditions allow. Based upon ongoing discussions with potential lenders, the Company expects to obtain new financing to pay its outstanding debt payable to Corbel and the outstanding subordinated notes before maturity in February 2025. The Company does not anticipate that any of the recently issued pronouncements relating to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards will have a material impact on its Consolidated Statement of Operations or its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Forward-Looking Statements The statements contained above in Management s Discussion and Analysis concerning the Company s future revenues, profitability, financial resources, market demand and product development are forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) relating to the Company that are based on the beliefs of the management of the Company, as well as assumptions and estimates made by and information currently available to the Company s management. The Company s actual results in the future may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties that exist in the Company s operations and business environment, including, but not limited to the effects of the COVID pandemic and its aftermath, competitive factors and pricing and cost pressures, non-renewal of franchise agreements or the openings contemplated by the Development Agreement not occurring, the Company s ability to service its loans and to obtaining financing to pay the Senior Note and the remaining subordinates notes before their maturity in 2025, shifts in market demand, the success of franchise programs, general economic conditions, changes in demand for the Company s products or franchises, the acceptance of the amended federal Form 941 return relating to the ERTC, the impact of franchise regulation, the success or failure of individual franchisees and inflation, other changes in prices or supplies of food ingredients and labor and as well as the factors discussed under Risk Factors contained in the 2023 Form 10-K. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions or estimates prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected or intended. If activist stockholder activities ensue, the Company business could be adversely impacted. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its variable-rate debt and the rate that will be required for the new financing. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding variable interest-bearing debt in the aggregate principal amount of approximately 6.9 million. The Company s current borrowings are at a variable rate tied to SOFR plus 7.75 per annum adjusted on a monthly basis. Based on its current debt structure, for each 1 increase in SOFR the Company would incur increased interest expense of approximately 72,000 over the succeeding 12-month period. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report, management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures are designed only to provide reasonable assurance, and no matter how well designed and operated, there can be no assurance that disclosure controls and procedures will operate effectively in all circumstances. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective based on the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO, version 2013, as discussed below. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The Company s management used the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) to perform this evaluation. As a result of this assessment, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting control environment for accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, which has now been corrected. Remediation Effort That Addressed the Material Weakness Management, including our Chief Financial Officer, moved all of the accounts payable and accrued expense accounts into one general ledger account and adopted procedures, including management reviews, to complete the reconciliation of accounts payable and accrued expenses and confirm amounts are balanced to the general ledger on a quarterly basis, beginning with the first quarter of 2024. In addition to the item noted above, the Company will continue to evaluate and improve its internal control over financial reporting. Except as disclosed above, there have been no changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this report materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls or financial reporting. 22 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.
